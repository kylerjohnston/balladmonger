KING Lear once ruled in this land,
     With princely pride and peace:
And had all things with content
     That might his joys increase:

Amongst those things that nature gave,
     Three daughters fair had he,
So princely seeming beautiful,
     As fairer could not be.

So on a time it pleasd the king,
     A question thus to move:
Which of his daughters to his grace
     Could shew the dearest love.

For to my age you bring content;
     Quoth he, then let me hear
Which of you three in plighted troth
     The kindest will appear.

To this the eldest first began,
     Dear father mild, quoth she,
Before your face to do you good
     My blood shall renderd be:

And for your sake my bleeding heart
     Shall there be cut in twain,
Ere that I see your reverend age
     The smallest grief sustain.

And so will I, the second said,
     Dear father for your sake;
The worst of all extremities
     For you Ill undertake.

And serve your highness night and day,
     With diligen[ce] and love;
The s[we]et content an pure delight,
     Discomfort may remove,

In doing so, you glad my soul,
     The aged father replyd.
But what sayist thou, my youngest girl,
     How stands thy love allyd!

My love, quoth young Cordelia, then,
     Which to your grace I owe;
Shall be the duty of a child,
     And that is all I shall bestow.

And wilt thou show no more, said he,
     Than doth thy duty bind?
I well perceive thy love is small,
     When as no more we find.

Henceforth I banish thee my court,
     Thou art no child of mine:
Nor any part of this my realm,
     By favour shall be thine.

Thy eldest sister offer more
     Than well I can demand;
To whom I equally bestow
     My kingdom and my land.

My pompeous state and all my goods
     That lovingly I may
With those thy sisters be mantaind,
     Until my dying day.

Thus flattering speaches won renown,
     By these two sisters here:
The third had causeless banishment.
     Yet was her love most dear.

For poor Cordelia patiently
     Went wandering up and down,
Upheld, unpityd gentle maid,
     Thro many an English town.

Until at last in famous France,
     She gentle fortune found:
Tho poor and bare, yet she was deemd
     The fairest on the ground,

Where when the King her virtue heard,
     And this fair lady seen.
With full consent of all the court,
     He made her his wife and queen.

Her father, old king Lear, this while
     With his two daughters staid,
Forgetful of their promisd loves.
     Full soon the same denyd.

And living in Queen Regans court,
     The eldest of the twain,
She took from him his chiefest means,
     And most of all his train,

But whereas twenty men were wont
     To wait with bended knee;
She gave allowance unto ten,
     And after scarce to three.

Nay, one she thought to much for him
     So she took all away
In hopes that in her court, good king!
     He would no longer stay.

Am I rewarded thus, said he,
     For giving all I have
Unto children? and to beg
     For what I want or crave.

Ill go unto my Goneril,
     My second child, I know
Will be more kind and beautiful,
     And will relieve my woe.

Full fast he hies unto her court.
     Where when she hears his moan,
Returnd him answer that she grievd
     That all his means were gone.

But no ways could relieve his wants,
     Yet if that he would stay,
Within her kitchen, he might have
     What scullions gave away.

When he had heard with bitter tears,
     He made this answer then,
In what I did let me be made
     Examples to all men.

I will return again, said he,
     Unto my Regan court;
She will not use me thus, I hope,
     But in a kinder sort.

Where when he came she gave command
     To drive him thence away:
When he was well within my court,
     Quoth she, he could not stay.

Then back again to Goneril,
     The woeful king did hie:
That in her kitchen he might have,
     What scullions did set by.

But there of that he was denyd,
     Which he had promisd late;
For once refusing he should not
     Come after to her gate.

Thus twixt his daughters, for relief,
     He wanderd up and down,
Being glad to feed on beggars food,
     That lately wore a crown.

And calling to remembrance then
     His youngest daughters words,
Who said the duty of a child
     Was all that love affords;

But doubting to repair to her,
     Whom he had banishd so,
Grew frantic mad, and in his mind,
     He bore the wounds of woe.

Which made him rend his milk white locks,
     And tresses from his head:
And all with blood bestaind his cheeks,
     With age and honor spread.

To hills and woods and watery founts
     He made his hourly moan,
To hills and woods and senseless things,
     Did seem to sigh and groan.

Even thus pressd with discontent
     He passed oer to France.
In hopes from kind Cordelia there,
     To find some gentler chance.

Most virtuous dame! which when she heard
     Of this her fathers grief,
As in duty bound, she quickly sent
     Him comfort and relief.

And by a train of noble peers,
     In brave and gallant sort,
She gave in charge he should be brought
     To Againipuss court;

Whose royal king, whose noble mind,
     So freely gave consent
To muster up his knights at arms,
     To fame and courage bent.

And so to England came with speed,
     To repossess king Lear;
And drive his daughters from their thrones
     By his Cordalia dear.

Where she, true hearted noble queen,
     Was in the battle slain;
Yet he, good king, in his old days
     Possessd his crown again.

But when he heard of Cordelias death,
     Who dyd indeed for love
Of her dear father in whose cause
     She did the battle move;

He swooning fell upon her breast
     From whence he never parted;
But on her bosom left his life,
     That was so truly hearted.

The Lords and Nobles when they saw
     The end of these events,
The other sisters unto death
     They doomed by consents.

And being dead their crowns they left
     Unto the next of kin.
Thus have you seen the fall of pride,
     And disobedient sin.
