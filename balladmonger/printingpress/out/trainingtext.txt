BEGIN NOW  The land my father owned, a thousand acres... paid for no encumbrances. END
BEGIN NOW It was as flat and fertile... black and exposed as any piece of land on the face of the earth. END
BEGIN NOW Covered by a beautiful dome sky... it seemed to me that when I was a child, it was the centre of the universe. END
BEGIN NOW I was eight when I first saw the farm in the world this way. END
BEGIN NOW I remember Sunday afternoons, and the long leisurely drives... my sister, Rose, who I adored, sitting against me in the back seat... my mother and father and baby sister, Caroline, in the front. END
BEGIN NOW Their voices were unhurried and self-confident... and our lives seemed secure and good. END
BEGIN NOW The next year, my mother died. END
BEGIN NOW Her name was Marion. END
BEGIN NOW May, Daddy called her. END
BEGIN NOW She died before she could confer on us... that my father was only a man, like any other... with habits and quirks, of ever-shifting moods... good judgement and bad. END
BEGIN NOW Caroline moved to Des Moines after school. END
BEGIN NOW Rose and I had lived on this land all of our lives. END
BEGIN NOW We never imagined living anywhere else. END
BEGIN NOW There were three houses on our farm. END
BEGIN NOW My father lived alone in the biggest one... the house where he was born, and where we all grew up. END
BEGIN NOW Rose lived directly across the road with her husband, Pete, and their two girls. END
BEGIN NOW My house was a quarter of a mile up the road. END
BEGIN NOW A -minute walk every morning to cook breakfast for my father. END
BEGIN NOW Daddy? END
BEGIN NOW Daddy? END
BEGIN NOW Daddy? END
BEGIN NOW What are you doing out here? END
BEGIN NOW It's after : , Daddy. END
BEGIN NOW You weren't in for breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW Couldn't keep that sister of yours... off these grates when she was small. END
BEGIN NOW No matter how much we whipped her, she was always over here... poking things through the holes. END
BEGIN NOW I remember. END
BEGIN NOW All this land was underwater, every last bit of it... the first time my great-grandfather came out here, Ginny. END
BEGIN NOW Took him years... to lay the tile, dig the drainage wells. END
BEGIN NOW No machines. END
BEGIN NOW He did it all by hand. END
BEGIN NOW No such thing as luck. END
BEGIN NOW They made their own. END
BEGIN NOW They made their own. END
BEGIN NOW Your mother loved every acre of it, Ginny. END
BEGIN NOW Look, that must be Harold out there on his new tractor. END
BEGIN NOW There's no fool like an old fool. END
BEGIN NOW So when's Harold's little party? END
BEGIN NOW Noon. END
BEGIN NOW It's not going to be so little. END
BEGIN NOW Probably have to bring our own liquor. END
BEGIN NOW You're going to be there, aren't you? END
BEGIN NOW I believe I will. END
BEGIN NOW As a matter of fact... END
BEGIN NOW I'm going to have a little surprise for you and your sisters. END
BEGIN NOW We haven't much time. END
BEGIN NOW You better shower. END
BEGIN NOW Smells good. END
BEGIN NOW I'm going ahead with Ginny. END
BEGIN NOW All right. END
BEGIN NOW You missed one there. END
BEGIN NOW Is it that ugly? END
BEGIN NOW I didn't mean it like that. END
BEGIN NOW I'll take the girls, okay? END
BEGIN NOW Okay. END
BEGIN NOW Hey, Rose. END
BEGIN NOW Hi. END
BEGIN NOW The girls are coming with Pete. END
BEGIN NOW Tabouli. END
BEGIN NOW What did you make? END
BEGIN NOW Swiss steak. END
BEGIN NOW For the prodigal son. END
BEGIN NOW You look pretty. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing like a scandal to make me feel better. END
BEGIN NOW What's more surprising... Jess showing up out of the blue, or Harold throwing a party for him? END
BEGIN NOW Isn't the party for his tractor? END
BEGIN NOW Harold, what have you got there? END
BEGIN NOW It's a , top of the line. END
BEGIN NOW Built by Steiger, so you know it's reliable. END
BEGIN NOW Case International bought them out... and they turned that ugly green into this nice red. END
BEGIN NOW Got a tape player up there, so I can listen to Bob Willis while I'm ploughing. END
BEGIN NOW Go on, fellows, take a look. END
BEGIN NOW Come on. END
BEGIN NOW Maybe later. END
BEGIN NOW Hi. END
BEGIN NOW Hey, there. END
BEGIN NOW Hon, look at that. END
BEGIN NOW Sure is nice to be home again, ain't it, Jess? END
BEGIN NOW He's got no plans of going back, neither. END
BEGIN NOW Trying to talk me into ploughing them acres of my beans... so he can try this, what do you call that, organic farming. END
BEGIN NOW Organic farming. END
BEGIN NOW Jess Clark returned home after leaving without a word at the age of His father, Harold, put on a big welcome for him. END
BEGIN NOW I think most people turned up out of curiosity... but nobody asked him why he'd come back, or even where he'd been. END
BEGIN NOW What is this, Ginny? END
BEGIN NOW I was just glad to see him. END
BEGIN NOW I bet that's Marlene's ambrosia. END
BEGIN NOW She likes to- Wow. END
BEGIN NOW What do we have here? END
BEGIN NOW Jess! END
BEGIN NOW It's the Cook girls. END
BEGIN NOW It's the pest. END
BEGIN NOW You got it. END
BEGIN NOW So, where's little Caroline? END
BEGIN NOW Little Caroline? END
BEGIN NOW Do you know, Jess, she's a lawyer now, down in Des Moines. END
BEGIN NOW She's going to get married this fall to another lawyer. END
BEGIN NOW Caroline? END
BEGIN NOW Married? END
BEGIN NOW She's not a baby, Jess. END
BEGIN NOW According to Daddy, it's almost too late to breed her. END
BEGIN NOW You know, sows and heifers and empty chambers... it's a whole theoretical system. END
BEGIN NOW Larry's still like that? END
BEGIN NOW You shouldn't think something's changed... just because you haven't seen it for years. END
BEGIN NOW I guess you remember that Rose always says what she thinks. END
BEGIN NOW And I remember you used to like your mum's Swiss steak. END
BEGIN NOW I haven't eaten meat in seven years. END
BEGIN NOW And you've come back? END
BEGIN NOW Hey, Rose. END
BEGIN NOW Look, it's Eileen Dahl, Ginny. END
BEGIN NOW I should go say hello. END
BEGIN NOW You'll starve to death around here. END
BEGIN NOW Let's see. END
BEGIN NOW I guess I won't. END
BEGIN NOW Watch your step, Daddy. END
BEGIN NOW Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW Here's Caroline now. END
BEGIN NOW And my husband, Ty. END
BEGIN NOW You remember him. END
BEGIN NOW Hello, Ginny. END
BEGIN NOW How you doing, Jess? END
BEGIN NOW Good to see you, Ty. END
BEGIN NOW You must be Jess. END
BEGIN NOW I'm Caroline Cook. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, I know. END
BEGIN NOW You probably don't remember me. END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, I do. END
BEGIN NOW It's nice to see you again. END
BEGIN NOW Are you staying the night? END
BEGIN NOW Daddy's. END
BEGIN NOW I'm going to go fix him a plate. END
BEGIN NOW Ty, give me a hand. END
BEGIN NOW Excuse me. END
BEGIN NOW That's Rose's husband, Pete. END
BEGIN NOW I don't think you ever met him. END
BEGIN NOW And the girls? END
BEGIN NOW Yours? END
BEGIN NOW No, Rose's. END
BEGIN NOW They're home for the weekend. END
BEGIN NOW They go to a boarding school in West Branch. END
BEGIN NOW You were gone before Rose had them. END
BEGIN NOW And your kids? END
BEGIN NOW No, we don't have any. END
BEGIN NOW I wonder how much he paid for it. END
BEGIN NOW It's a big outfit for a guy his age. END
BEGIN NOW Daddy was the most respected man in the county. END
BEGIN NOW No farmer within miles... would make a decision without first consulting Larry Cook. END
BEGIN NOW Caroline came home every third weekend to visit him. END
BEGIN NOW They were always close. END
BEGIN NOW Somehow, she seemed to understand him better than Rose and I did. END
BEGIN NOW Our farm has been in the Cook family for years. END
BEGIN NOW Provided us with a fine living. END
BEGIN NOW In my lifetime, it's become the most valuable property in the county. END
BEGIN NOW If I died tomorrow... you girls would be lumped with all those inheritance taxes... giving the government money for nothing. END
BEGIN NOW Coffee, Daddy? END
BEGIN NOW So there you have it. END
BEGIN NOW I have a plan. END
BEGIN NOW What's the plan? END
BEGIN NOW We're going to form a corporation. END
BEGIN NOW And you girls are all going to have shares. END
BEGIN NOW You girls, and Ty, Pete... you'll run the show. END
BEGIN NOW You'll each have a third. END
BEGIN NOW Well? END
BEGIN NOW What do you say? END
BEGIN NOW It's a good idea, Daddy. END
BEGIN NOW It's a great idea. END
BEGIN NOW I don't know. END
BEGIN NOW I want to think about it. END
BEGIN NOW You don't want it, my girl, you're out. END
BEGIN NOW Simple as that. END
BEGIN NOW It was no use telling him that Caroline hadn't turned him down. END
BEGIN NOW She'd just expressed a doubt. END
BEGIN NOW She'd spoken as a lawyer, when she should've spoken as a daughter. END
BEGIN NOW But my father's pride had been injured. END
BEGIN NOW And we all understood that something important had just happened. END
BEGIN NOW Who'd ever thought Larry would do something like this? END
BEGIN NOW I can't believe it. END
BEGIN NOW If he doesn't change his mind, I want a hog-confinement building. END
BEGIN NOW And I want it air-conditioned, too. END
BEGIN NOW They've got these automatic flush systems... so one man can keep the place clean all by himself, no trouble. END
BEGIN NOW How are we going to pay for it? END
BEGIN NOW The bank will roll out the carpet for us. END
BEGIN NOW You mean borrow? END
BEGIN NOW Sure. END
BEGIN NOW We get a good breeding line of our own going... we can put those babies up for adoption. END
BEGIN NOW Everybody wants one. END
BEGIN NOW I'll say, Yeah, Jake, but you got to feed them with your own spoon... and let them sleep on your side of the bed. END
BEGIN NOW He'll say, Sure, Ty, anything. END
BEGIN NOW I've already started his college fund. END
BEGIN NOW This is where we stop working for your dad, Ginny, and start working for ourselves. END
BEGIN NOW It'll be our place, our way of doing things. END
BEGIN NOW You know, sleeping here is only going to make Daddy madder. END
BEGIN NOW Daddy changes his whole life overnight. END
BEGIN NOW Take it while it's on offer. END
BEGIN NOW He's a farmer, Rose. END
BEGIN NOW He doesn't know how to be anything else. END
BEGIN NOW Do you remember... END
BEGIN NOW I was just remembering it. END
BEGIN NOW Before Mummy died, guess you were about five... and you said, When I grow up... END
BEGIN NOW I'm not going to be a farm wife. END
BEGIN NOW And she laughed, and she asked you what you were going to be. END
BEGIN NOW And you said, A farmer. END
BEGIN NOW I don't remember Mummy, you know that. END
BEGIN NOW Anyway, I was five. END
BEGIN NOW Sweet dreams. END
BEGIN NOW You, too. END
BEGIN NOW I know it, and he knows I know it. END
BEGIN NOW And that's why he's so pissed off at me. END
BEGIN NOW What should I give him, a pie or a cake? END
BEGIN NOW Hi, Sadie. END
BEGIN NOW Hi, Ginny. END
BEGIN NOW Give me one of those apple cakes. END
BEGIN NOW I'm going to get this, okay? END
BEGIN NOW Just come along, come up... give him a hug and a kiss and say, I'm sorry, Daddy. END
BEGIN NOW It's too late. END
BEGIN NOW I spent the night at Rose's. END
BEGIN NOW Just ignore that part. END
BEGIN NOW Well, he won't. END
BEGIN NOW If he mentions it, just say, I was afraid you were mad at me, Daddy. END
BEGIN NOW I hate that little-girl stuff. END
BEGIN NOW I know. END
BEGIN NOW Caroline, this is important. END
BEGIN NOW He's handing over his whole life. END
BEGIN NOW Can't you understand that? END
BEGIN NOW We have to receive it in the right spirit. END
BEGIN NOW Please, just do it this once. END
BEGIN NOW It's the last time, I promise. END
BEGIN NOW I don't know, Ginny. END
BEGIN NOW I will try, okay? END
BEGIN NOW Now, don't be mad at me. END
BEGIN NOW Now, why can't you say that to Daddy? END
BEGIN NOW Here you go, Ginny. END
BEGIN NOW Thanks. END
BEGIN NOW It's acres of gladiolas, , bulbs an acre. END
BEGIN NOW Thanks. END
BEGIN NOW I'll pass. END
BEGIN NOW Well, , hogs farrowed are conditioned to eat. END
BEGIN NOW , gladiolas? END
BEGIN NOW Oh, Pete. END
BEGIN NOW You should hear yourself sometime. END
BEGIN NOW Ginny. END
BEGIN NOW How's it going out there? END
BEGIN NOW Where did you spring from? END
BEGIN NOW I just thought you might want some help. END
BEGIN NOW I was making coffee. END
BEGIN NOW Here, Jess, let me do that. END
BEGIN NOW Things are moving pretty fast. END
BEGIN NOW Never thought of Daddy as being a creature of impulse before, but... END
BEGIN NOW I don't think things will change much, really. END
BEGIN NOW It's going to be fine. END
BEGIN NOW Change is good. END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, I'll be sitting here watching other people work while you're out there... working your tractor, trying to pay it off. END
BEGIN NOW All right, Kenny, let's go to it. END
BEGIN NOW Now is the time. END
BEGIN NOW Just a moment, Larry. END
BEGIN NOW Okay, Ken, let's get on with it. END
BEGIN NOW I couldn't believe that Daddy was actually dividing the farm in half... and signing it over to Rose and me... leaving Caroline out completely. END
BEGIN NOW My first impulse was to call her, but they had fought before... not spoken for days, and then come back together as if nothing had happened. END
BEGIN NOW The pectorals, that's right. END
BEGIN NOW Now, push against my hands. END
BEGIN NOW There you go. END
BEGIN NOW All right now, the other way. END
BEGIN NOW Push against my hands. END
BEGIN NOW There, you feel that? END
BEGIN NOW Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW That's good. END
BEGIN NOW All right. END
BEGIN NOW I still feel lopsided. END
BEGIN NOW You will for a while, Rose. END
BEGIN NOW It's par for the course. END
BEGIN NOW Maybe I should have the other one off for symmetry. END
BEGIN NOW I want to buy something pretty. END
BEGIN NOW I want to do stuff I've stopped myself doing. END
BEGIN NOW You know? END
BEGIN NOW Mummy dying of exactly the same thing, I didn't think I had a chance. END
BEGIN NOW Rose. END
BEGIN NOW No, I thought it'd get me for sure. END
BEGIN NOW I know it's only the three-month check... and there's the six-month, and the one-year. END
BEGIN NOW But I believe him, Ginny. END
BEGIN NOW I'm going to be okay. END
BEGIN NOW What are you doing? END
BEGIN NOW Get the ball! END
BEGIN NOW Come on, Pete! END
BEGIN NOW Hit it. END
BEGIN NOW Come on, Scotty! END
BEGIN NOW Pete, throw it. END
BEGIN NOW Throw it, Ginny. END
BEGIN NOW You are pitiful. END
BEGIN NOW So, then they hold me down, they shave off my beard and all my hair. END
BEGIN NOW I never figured out why they didn't turn on the lights. END
BEGIN NOW The next day, I hitched a lift into Spokane, and when I get out... the guy leans across to me and whispers, I hope the chemotherapy's a success. END
BEGIN NOW Rose, I'm sorry, I forgot. END
BEGIN NOW Don't be. END
BEGIN NOW I didn't have chemo. END
BEGIN NOW I had it lopped off. END
BEGIN NOW He doesn't want to know, Rose. END
BEGIN NOW No, that's okay. END
BEGIN NOW I got to keep the other one. END
BEGIN NOW All I have to do is wink when I look in the mirror, and forget it ever happened. END
BEGIN NOW Waterworks. END
BEGIN NOW I used to hitch between Muscatine and Davenport... with this band I played with. END
BEGIN NOW You had a band? END
BEGIN NOW What'd you play? END
BEGIN NOW Guitar, acoustic. END
BEGIN NOW He was good. END
BEGIN NOW Thank you. END
BEGIN NOW Anyway, I got a lift this one night with this guy and his wife. END
BEGIN NOW They were hippies. END
BEGIN NOW Don't tell this story. END
BEGIN NOW They were driving this VW van... with these two Afghans and a cat in the back. END
BEGIN NOW So, they pull over to the side of the road, and we smoke a joint. END
BEGIN NOW And the wife, Lucinda- Pete. END
BEGIN NOW She takes me in the back- With the Afghans? END
BEGIN NOW Ties me to this spare tire, mounts the dogs on the back seat... so they got a good view. END
BEGIN NOW It gets worse every time he tells it. END
BEGIN NOW She fucks my brains out. END
BEGIN NOW That woman could suck a golf ball through a garden hose. END
BEGIN NOW Pete, take your turn. END
BEGIN NOW So, are you sticking around here or what? END
BEGIN NOW Harold and organic farming? END
BEGIN NOW Organic farming? END
BEGIN NOW You heard from Caroline? END
BEGIN NOW I've got to call her- Dad's coming around. END
BEGIN NOW I could maybe start with an acre or two. END
BEGIN NOW What are you going to plant? END
BEGIN NOW Wheat grass? END
BEGIN NOW Oh, man. END
BEGIN NOW What's the matter? END
BEGIN NOW Nothing. END
BEGIN NOW You drove by and then you drove back. END
BEGIN NOW I just came back to see what you were doing. END
BEGIN NOW I was reading a magazine. END
BEGIN NOW Why is Ty cultivating that field? END
BEGIN NOW They done planting the beans? END
BEGIN NOW Almost, I think. END
BEGIN NOW Daddy, why don't you come to the house for supper tonight... and then you can ask Ty yourself? END
BEGIN NOW Do you want anything before I leave? END
BEGIN NOW Well then, I'm going now. END
BEGIN NOW Okay? END
BEGIN NOW He was there when I went to Pike for bread, and there when I got back. END
BEGIN NOW Perfecting that death's head stare... will be his lifework from now on, so we better get used to it. END
BEGIN NOW I'm sorry. END
BEGIN NOW Why is this kitchen so crowded all of a sudden? END
BEGIN NOW If you're not cooking, why don't you go outside? END
BEGIN NOW Where's Pammy? END
BEGIN NOW Outside. END
BEGIN NOW Come on, guys, I'll show you what I'm building. END
BEGIN NOW Rose, isn't it your turn to have Daddy for dinner? END
BEGIN NOW No, I fed him earlier. END
BEGIN NOW Pammy, honey, why don't you come on in the house? END
BEGIN NOW Hello? END
BEGIN NOW Is Daddy okay? END
BEGIN NOW Caroline, are you in Des Moines? END
BEGIN NOW No, I'm in Pike. END
BEGIN NOW Are you okay? END
BEGIN NOW You never called me, Ginny. END
BEGIN NOW Why didn't you call? END
BEGIN NOW Well, you didn't think I was mad at you, did you? END
BEGIN NOW What was I supposed to think? END
BEGIN NOW That you just forgot about me? END
BEGIN NOW It's a madhouse here, I can hardly hear you. END
BEGIN NOW I need to talk to you, Ginny. END
BEGIN NOW Honey, we've just started supper. END
BEGIN NOW Why don't you come out here? END
BEGIN NOW No, I'm not going to the house. END
BEGIN NOW Come on, sweetie. END
BEGIN NOW What about the river? END
BEGIN NOW Ginny, I need minutes of your time. END
BEGIN NOW All right, okay. END
BEGIN NOW All right, I'll be right there. END
BEGIN NOW You know where Daddy was yesterday? END
BEGIN NOW No, why? END
BEGIN NOW He was in Des Moines. END
BEGIN NOW Daddy never goes to Des Moines. END
BEGIN NOW He did. END
BEGIN NOW He came to my office. END
BEGIN NOW I wasn't there, I was in New York. END
BEGIN NOW They said he was acting weird. END
BEGIN NOW Weird, how? END
BEGIN NOW Gawking at everyone, and throwing his head around in a weird kind of way. END
BEGIN NOW I don't know, weird. END
BEGIN NOW He'd probably been to a bar, you know and then- He was drinking and driving? END
BEGIN NOW Sounds like it. END
BEGIN NOW You can't let him do that. END
BEGIN NOW I can't stop him. END
BEGIN NOW Take away his keys. END
BEGIN NOW It's not funny. END
BEGIN NOW It's a pretty funny idea, taking away his keys. END
BEGIN NOW Besides, he doesn't have anything to do. END
BEGIN NOW He likes to drive around. END
BEGIN NOW You said he was drinking. END
BEGIN NOW It sounds like it. END
BEGIN NOW I don't know for sure. END
BEGIN NOW Why isn't he working? END
BEGIN NOW He doesn't want to work. END
BEGIN NOW He's tired of farming. END
BEGIN NOW He's taking the only kind of vacation he knows how to take. END
BEGIN NOW You know, he did what he wanted. END
BEGIN NOW So, you and Rose signed the papers? END
BEGIN NOW What papers? END
BEGIN NOW The corporation papers, the transfer papers. END
BEGIN NOW Of course we did. END
BEGIN NOW We didn't have any choice. END
BEGIN NOW All I know is, Daddy's lost everything. END
BEGIN NOW He's made an error of judgement, and he's suffering. END
BEGIN NOW And maybe he's got some regrets, and it's making him act strange. END
BEGIN NOW But you don't care enough to do anything about it. END
BEGIN NOW It's clear who's benefiting here. END
BEGIN NOW What happened to you? END
BEGIN NOW Caroline? END
BEGIN NOW Girls, lunch. END
BEGIN NOW Coming. END
BEGIN NOW Happy Father's Day, Daddy. END
BEGIN NOW Happy Father's Day, Daddy. END
BEGIN NOW Somebody pass the corn. END
BEGIN NOW You want me to carve it, Daddy? END
BEGIN NOW Just go down between the bones. END
BEGIN NOW I know that. END
BEGIN NOW I know you do. END
BEGIN NOW Don't tell me what to do. END
BEGIN NOW I wasn't. END
BEGIN NOW Give it here. END
BEGIN NOW The potatoes look great. END
BEGIN NOW Daddy, did you drive all the way to Des Moines? END
BEGIN NOW Caroline was wondering about it, that's all. END
BEGIN NOW You girls talk a lot on that long distance. END
BEGIN NOW Ginny, peas? END
BEGIN NOW She was worried about it, that's all. END
BEGIN NOW Did I say I went to Des Moines? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW I'll get it. END
BEGIN NOW I got it. END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes I hate him. END
BEGIN NOW I want him to go to hell and stay there forever, just roasting. END
BEGIN NOW Rose. END
BEGIN NOW Why do you say, Rose\... in that shocked way? END
BEGIN NOW Because you're not supposed to wish evil on someone... or because you don't really hate him? END
BEGIN NOW I don't. END
BEGIN NOW I really don't. END
BEGIN NOW I mean, he's a bear- He's not a bear. END
BEGIN NOW He's not innocent like that. END
BEGIN NOW Rose. END
BEGIN NOW And sometimes I hate you, too. END
BEGIN NOW Me? END
BEGIN NOW I hate you because you're the link between me and him. END
BEGIN NOW Who? END
BEGIN NOW Daddy, of course. END
BEGIN NOW Don't be so stupid. END
BEGIN NOW You're such a good daughter, so slow to judge. END
BEGIN NOW It's like stupidity. END
BEGIN NOW It drives me crazy. END
BEGIN NOW I was thinking the same thing about Ty last night. END
BEGIN NOW He never questions Daddy. END
BEGIN NOW He's so loyal. END
BEGIN NOW It seems sort of dumb. END
BEGIN NOW Every time I make up my mind to do something, get off this place... leave Pete, get a job, earn some money, you stop me. END
BEGIN NOW Anyway, the point is... END
BEGIN NOW I've let him get away with a lot of stuff. END
BEGIN NOW We all have, but... we can set rules, and I think the rules can be pretty simple. END
BEGIN NOW Ginny? END
BEGIN NOW Tell me what you really think about Daddy. END
BEGIN NOW I don't know. END
BEGIN NOW I love Daddy, but he's so in the habit of giving orders, no... back talk, you know. END
BEGIN NOW I mean, he drinks and everything. END
BEGIN NOW Probably for as long as we've known him. END
BEGIN NOW You're making me nervous. END
BEGIN NOW I don't know what you want me to say. END
BEGIN NOW Mummy never told us what to think of Daddy and... sometimes, I wonder whether they got along together and... whether she liked him. END
BEGIN NOW I think different things. END
BEGIN NOW Things like that. END
BEGIN NOW Shit, Ginny. END
BEGIN NOW I don't hate you. END
BEGIN NOW You know I don't. END
BEGIN NOW I think things are going to get better now. END
BEGIN NOW Maybe rules will do the trick. END
BEGIN NOW We can try. END
BEGIN NOW United front, right? END
BEGIN NOW Right. END
BEGIN NOW So, want to go for a walk? END
BEGIN NOW How long have you been here? END
BEGIN NOW About a minute. END
BEGIN NOW You do appear suddenly. END
BEGIN NOW I've noticed that about you. END
BEGIN NOW You're just oblivious. END
BEGIN NOW I've noticed that about you. END
BEGIN NOW You see that? END
BEGIN NOW Wild burdock. END
BEGIN NOW You know what these are? END
BEGIN NOW Prairie indigo. END
BEGIN NOW Very poisonous. END
BEGIN NOW What about these? END
BEGIN NOW I know these. END
BEGIN NOW Locoweed. END
BEGIN NOW Very good. END
BEGIN NOW Jess laughed and I laughed. END
BEGIN NOW And for a moment, everything seemed remote and not very important. END
BEGIN NOW I wondered if maybe that wasn't the right way to look at things after all. END
BEGIN NOW Even after you've been gone all this time? END
BEGIN NOW I had the strong sense that we had stumbled into some kind of daring privacy. END
BEGIN NOW And that the secluded place we were walking somehow allowed it. END
BEGIN NOW That's new. END
BEGIN NOW It's you guys. END
BEGIN NOW What do you mean? END
BEGIN NOW I know you didn't initiate the transfer... but people are getting suspicious. END
BEGIN NOW Wondering how you and Rose got Larry to give you the place... when the whole thing's obviously driving him crazy. END
BEGIN NOW Shit, Harold was there. END
BEGIN NOW It was at your party. END
BEGIN NOW He knows exactly how it happened. END
BEGIN NOW Well, the talk will die down. END
BEGIN NOW It always does. END
BEGIN NOW It's not Harold's main problem. END
BEGIN NOW What is? END
BEGIN NOW The thing is, my dad loves me. END
BEGIN NOW He wants to win me, thinks he can keep me here with the farm... even though he knows that I wouldn't farm the way he does. END
BEGIN NOW Harold wants to fix me, right here in Zebulon County. END
BEGIN NOW Would that be so bad? END
BEGIN NOW When I think of myself years down the road, I wonder if it'll be Loren and me... the Clark brothers, Frick and Frack. END
BEGIN NOW Well, we're here. END
BEGIN NOW I saw Caroline got married. END
BEGIN NOW Caroline, yes, they had a ceremony. END
BEGIN NOW A small one. END
BEGIN NOW Those are nice, too. END
BEGIN NOW These are sweet. END
BEGIN NOW Mum. END
BEGIN NOW That's pretty. END
BEGIN NOW She didn't mention a word of this when she talked to you, did she? END
BEGIN NOW Maybe we should call her. END
BEGIN NOW For what? END
BEGIN NOW This is for us. END
BEGIN NOW This is how she's letting us know. END
BEGIN NOW The thing is just to take it in stride. END
BEGIN NOW I'm going to send her a present, a very expensive present... with just a little card saying, From Rose Lewis and family. END
BEGIN NOW I just can't understand why she would do something- If we all concentrate on playing the game, we'll have a better time. END
BEGIN NOW Aren't you having a good time, Ty? END
BEGIN NOW I think if we're going to play- My God, Ty. END
BEGIN NOW Ginny, settle down. END
BEGIN NOW I'm tired of this game. END
BEGIN NOW Rose! END
BEGIN NOW Don't. END
BEGIN NOW As if I would. END
BEGIN NOW As if you haven't. END
BEGIN NOW Hello? END
BEGIN NOW Oh, my God. END
BEGIN NOW Where is he? END
BEGIN NOW Daddy? END
BEGIN NOW Dad? END
BEGIN NOW Larry? END
BEGIN NOW You okay? END
BEGIN NOW Daddy, do you have the pills the nurse gave you? END
BEGIN NOW Daddy! END
BEGIN NOW Ginny. END
BEGIN NOW I know you're hurt, and I'm sorry you got in an accident... but now's the time to talk about it. END
BEGIN NOW I mean, you've got to take this to heart. END
BEGIN NOW You simply... can't drive all over creation. END
BEGIN NOW Especially not when you're drinking. END
BEGIN NOW They'll probably revoke your licence. END
BEGIN NOW But even if they don't, I will. END
BEGIN NOW If you ever do this again, I'll take away the keys to your truck. END
BEGIN NOW And if that doesn't do it, then I'll sell it. END
BEGIN NOW You told me when I was little... that one warning ought to be enough. END
BEGIN NOW Well, Daddy, this is your warning. END
BEGIN NOW I mean it about the driving, Daddy. END
BEGIN NOW And Rose will back me up. END
BEGIN NOW I got nothing. END
BEGIN NOW What time is it? END
BEGIN NOW : I left the house at : Seems a lifetime ago. END
BEGIN NOW Is that true? END
BEGIN NOW You've done this before. END
BEGIN NOW I've slept with women before. END
BEGIN NOW I haven't done this before. END
BEGIN NOW I haven't slept with other men. END
BEGIN NOW I've only slept with Ty. END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, I know, Ginny. END
BEGIN NOW I know what that means. END
BEGIN NOW Maybe you do. END
BEGIN NOW Maybe not. END
BEGIN NOW Ginny, can I ask you a question? END
BEGIN NOW How come you and Ty don't have kids? END
BEGIN NOW I've had five miscarriages. END
BEGIN NOW Jesus. END
BEGIN NOW Ginny- Ty only knows about three of them. END
BEGIN NOW He couldn't stand the disappointment after that... so I've kind of kept the fact that I'm still trying to myself. END
BEGIN NOW It's kind of like a last chance. END
BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW Didn't your doctor tell you not to drink the well water? END
BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW There's been stuff written about this for years. END
BEGIN NOW Ginny, the fertiliser runoff drains into the aquifer, and you drink it. END
BEGIN NOW Rose drinks it. END
BEGIN NOW It doesn't affect everyone the same. END
BEGIN NOW Daddy, don't hang up. END
BEGIN NOW I'm worried about you. END
BEGIN NOW Why aren't you out working with Ty? END
BEGIN NOW Look, I'm coming there to talk to you about the farm. END
BEGIN NOW I'm listening. END
BEGIN NOW We're breaking into our regularly scheduled programming to bring you... this continuing weather update. END
BEGIN NOW A severe thunderstorm warning has just been issued for Zebulon County. END
BEGIN NOW He wrecks my truck, I'll kill him. END
BEGIN NOW As we speak the latest look at Doppler radar does show that- Daddy took Pete's truck. END
BEGIN NOW He did what? END
BEGIN NOW He's probably been drinking. END
BEGIN NOW I can't believe this. END
BEGIN NOW Did Grandpa steal Daddy's truck? END
BEGIN NOW Not exactly, honey. END
BEGIN NOW He shouldn't be out in this weather. END
BEGIN NOW I'm going to Pike, see if I can find him before this storm hits. END
BEGIN NOW You coming? END
BEGIN NOW One of these times he's going to kill himself or, God forbid, somebody else. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing could kill him. END
BEGIN NOW Ginny, come out here, please. END
BEGIN NOW Larry has some things to say. END
BEGIN NOW Damned right, I have. END
BEGIN NOW Daddy, it's going to storm. END
BEGIN NOW Why don't I take you home, and we can talk in the morning? END
BEGIN NOW I don't want to go home. END
BEGIN NOW You girls stick me there. END
BEGIN NOW We don't stick you there. END
BEGIN NOW It's the nicest house. END
BEGIN NOW Daddy, you've lived there your whole life. END
BEGIN NOW Let me take you home. END
BEGIN NOW Go with Rose now and then tomorrow- Let Larry have his say. END
BEGIN NOW I'd rather stay out in the storm than be stuck back there. END
BEGIN NOW Fine. END
BEGIN NOW Do what you want, you will anyway. END
BEGIN NOW Spoken like the bitch you are. END
BEGIN NOW Daddy. END
BEGIN NOW You don't have to drive me around anymore... or cook the goddamn breakfast, or clean the goddamn house... or tell me what I can do, and what I can't do. END
BEGIN NOW Just a bitch is all. END
BEGIN NOW A dried-up whore. END
BEGIN NOW Bitch. END
BEGIN NOW Larry. END
BEGIN NOW Get off me. END
BEGIN NOW Come on. END
BEGIN NOW Pete and I will take you home... and you can apologise to Ginny in the morning. END
BEGIN NOW Now don't you make me out to be crazy. END
BEGIN NOW I know your game. END
BEGIN NOW It's you girls driving me crazy. END
BEGIN NOW I give you everything I got. END
BEGIN NOW And what do I get in return? END
BEGIN NOW Just some orders! END
BEGIN NOW About doing this, doing that. END
BEGIN NOW We didn't ask for what you gave us. END
BEGIN NOW Maybe it's high time we got some reward for what we gave you. END
BEGIN NOW You say you know all about Ginny. END
BEGIN NOW Daddy, I know all about you... and you know I know. END
BEGIN NOW This is what we've got to offer, this same life. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing more, nothing less. END
BEGIN NOW If you don't want it, go elsewhere. END
BEGIN NOW Get somebody else to take you in, because I, for one, have had it. END
BEGIN NOW Do you hear her? END
BEGIN NOW She talks to me almost worse than you do. END
BEGIN NOW If you think this is bad, Daddy... you'd be amazed at what you really deserve. END
BEGIN NOW As far as I'm concerned, you're on your own now. END
BEGIN NOW Your house is down the road. END
BEGIN NOW You can get there. END
BEGIN NOW I'm going inside. END
BEGIN NOW Don't think you can treat me like this! END
BEGIN NOW I'll throw you whores off the place! END
BEGIN NOW I'll stop the building. END
BEGIN NOW I'll get my land back. END
BEGIN NOW You'll never have children, you haven't a hope. END
BEGIN NOW And your children are going to laugh when you die. END
BEGIN NOW Okay, that's it. END
BEGIN NOW All right, Larry let's go home now. END
BEGIN NOW Come on. END
BEGIN NOW Come on, get off of me, for Christ's sake. END
BEGIN NOW Come on, get into the truck. END
BEGIN NOW It's starting to rain. END
BEGIN NOW Larry, just get into the truck. END
BEGIN NOW I don't want to fight you now. END
BEGIN NOW Come on. END
BEGIN NOW You going to help me or what? END
BEGIN NOW Larry, come on back now. END
BEGIN NOW Where are you going? END
BEGIN NOW Come on. END
BEGIN NOW What an asshole. END
BEGIN NOW This is it. END
BEGIN NOW This is really it. END
BEGIN NOW You got a coat or something? END
BEGIN NOW Will you take one to Ty? END
BEGIN NOW Oh, shit. END
BEGIN NOW I hope he dies in it. END
BEGIN NOW Mummy. END
BEGIN NOW I'm coming. END
BEGIN NOW Hold on, I'll be right there. END
BEGIN NOW What happened to the light? END
BEGIN NOW I used to fantasise that Mummy had escaped... and taken an assumed name. END
BEGIN NOW And someday she would be back for us. END
BEGIN NOW You want to hear the life that I had picked for us? END
BEGIN NOW Sure. END
BEGIN NOW She was a waitress at the restaurant of a nice hotel. END
BEGIN NOW And we lived with her in a Hollywood-style apartment... with nice shag carpeting, white walls... little sounds from the neighbours on either side. END
BEGIN NOW I guess I never thought of living anywhere but the farm. END
BEGIN NOW Isn't that funny? END
BEGIN NOW I wanted it to be different, though. END
BEGIN NOW Ginny, you sound so... mild. END
BEGIN NOW Aren't you furious? END
BEGIN NOW What good is that? END
BEGIN NOW Daddy's always had rages. END
BEGIN NOW You don't remember how he used to come after us, do you? END
BEGIN NOW Of course I remember. END
BEGIN NOW I was remembering tonight, while he was yelling at me... about that time that I lost my shoe... and I tried to hide behind the stove, but Mummy made me come out. END
BEGIN NOW And then Daddy beat me till I fell down. END
BEGIN NOW I don't mean when we got strapped or whipped. END
BEGIN NOW I mean when he went into your room at night. END
BEGIN NOW I don't remember that. END
BEGIN NOW You were You must remember. END
BEGIN NOW Grandpa Cook... used to prowl around the house at night, looking at everybody. END
BEGIN NOW It was kind of like checking the hogs or something. END
BEGIN NOW It wasn't like checking the hogs with Daddy. END
BEGIN NOW What are you saying? END
BEGIN NOW You know. END
BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW He was having sex with you. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, Jesus, Rose. END
BEGIN NOW He was not. END
BEGIN NOW I saw him go in. END
BEGIN NOW He stayed for a long time. END
BEGIN NOW He was probably closing the windows or something. END
BEGIN NOW I checked my clock. END
BEGIN NOW Rose. END
BEGIN NOW How can I believe that you woke up all those years ago... and saw Daddy come into my room and checked your clock... then saw him come back out and checked your clock again? END
BEGIN NOW And that's evidence, that he was in there... Daddy... he might be a drinker and a rager... but he goes to church. END
BEGIN NOW It's true. END
BEGIN NOW Well, it didn't happen. END
BEGIN NOW But it did. END
BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW Because when he stopped going in to you, he started coming in to me. END
BEGIN NOW And that's what he did. END
BEGIN NOW We had sex in my bed. END
BEGIN NOW What, when you were ? END
BEGIN NOW And , and , and I don't believe it. END
BEGIN NOW I thought it was okay. END
BEGIN NOW It must've been okay because he said it was, and he was the rule maker. END
BEGIN NOW I just can't listen to this. END
BEGIN NOW He didn't rape me, Ginny. END
BEGIN NOW He seduced me. END
BEGIN NOW He said it was okay, and that it was good to please him. END
BEGIN NOW That I was special. END
BEGIN NOW And he loved me. END
BEGIN NOW What about Caroline? END
BEGIN NOW I'm not sure. END
BEGIN NOW He said that if I went along with him, he wouldn't get interested in her. END
BEGIN NOW Is that why you send the girls away to boarding school? END
BEGIN NOW I keep my eyes peeled. END
BEGIN NOW So does Pete. END
BEGIN NOW Pete knows? END
BEGIN NOW You know they're getting to be the age we were. END
BEGIN NOW Not we, you! END
BEGIN NOW It didn't happen to me! END
BEGIN NOW I don't know what to say. END
BEGIN NOW This is so ridiculous. END
BEGIN NOW I feel so idiotic... so naive, foolish. END
BEGIN NOW Rose... END
BEGIN NOW I'm so sorry... that he did that to you. END
BEGIN NOW Don't make me feel sorry for myself. END
BEGIN NOW The more pissed off I am, the better I feel. END
BEGIN NOW They threw me out. END
BEGIN NOW Ginny? END
BEGIN NOW You got a problem, girlie. END
BEGIN NOW You think so, Harold? END
BEGIN NOW I know so. END
BEGIN NOW I'll take some of that. END
BEGIN NOW Here, I'll make fresh. END
BEGIN NOW Your dad don't want to come home here. END
BEGIN NOW He don't want to lay eyes on any of the whole lot of you. END
BEGIN NOW How long are you going to keep him there? END
BEGIN NOW He's got a right to stay. END
BEGIN NOW We've been friends for years or more. END
BEGIN NOW Fine. END
BEGIN NOW That's a woman's word, that fine. END
BEGIN NOW Harold, what would you like me to say? END
BEGIN NOW I want you to say he's your dad. END
BEGIN NOW And even though he's a pain in the butt, you owe him. END
BEGIN NOW Rose owes him, too. END
BEGIN NOW Rose doesn't owe him anything. END
BEGIN NOW Rose has always been trouble, between you and me. END
BEGIN NOW You shut up, Harold! END
BEGIN NOW You hear me? END
BEGIN NOW You just shut up about Rose and Daddy. END
BEGIN NOW He's a stubborn man. END
BEGIN NOW It don't matter what I think or say. END
BEGIN NOW He don't like being told he's wrong. END
BEGIN NOW Especially when it ain't clear how wrong he is. END
BEGIN NOW Now, I'm going to do you a favour here. END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, what's that? END
BEGIN NOW Here's what I'm going to do for you. END
BEGIN NOW I'm going to bring your dad to the church supper on Sunday... and you girls, you show up there and be sociable. END
BEGIN NOW I think you can work this out. END
BEGIN NOW Larry's got his side, and you got your side. END
BEGIN NOW I know that. END
BEGIN NOW Look at him. END
BEGIN NOW It just goes to show you. END
BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW How much we were doing for him. END
BEGIN NOW Namely, everything. END
BEGIN NOW Although, you'd think Harold could lend him a comb. END
BEGIN NOW Joan Stanley thinks Daddy's lost his mind. END
BEGIN NOW It enrages me. END
BEGIN NOW Enrages? END
BEGIN NOW Rose, just look at him. END
BEGIN NOW Ginny, it's just a ploy for sympathy. END
BEGIN NOW What next? END
BEGIN NOW I don't wanna know what's next. END
BEGIN NOW What are you afraid of? END
BEGIN NOW I guess I'm just afraid of anything that has to do with Daddy. END
BEGIN NOW Did we treat him badly? END
BEGIN NOW People seem to think we did. END
BEGIN NOW But did we? END
BEGIN NOW Do you think so? END
BEGIN NOW I don't think so. END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW Well, then stick with what's true. END
BEGIN NOW Okay, Rose. END
BEGIN NOW Just family, thanks. END
BEGIN NOW Ginny, why don't you sit here? END
BEGIN NOW Jess? END
BEGIN NOW Thank you. END
BEGIN NOW Everybody, settle down, please. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna talk to the Boss. END
BEGIN NOW With our heads down, and our hearts upraised, we pray. END
BEGIN NOW Almighty God, we thank you for these blessings. END
BEGIN NOW Not only of food, but of family and friends. END
BEGIN NOW We rededicate ourselves to your service. END
BEGIN NOW Amen. END
BEGIN NOW Let's eat. END
BEGIN NOW Hey, everybody. END
BEGIN NOW Look at them chowing down here like they ain't done nothing. END
BEGIN NOW Threw a man off his own farm on a night you wouldn't keep wolf out of your barn. END
BEGIN NOW Pipe down, Harold Clark. END
BEGIN NOW You're talking through your hat, same as always. END
BEGIN NOW You all know who I'm talking about, Ginny and Rose Cook. END
BEGIN NOW Well, I got their number. END
BEGIN NOW Nobody's fooled me. END
BEGIN NOW Bitch. END
BEGIN NOW That's what you are. END
BEGIN NOW I got your number, too, you son of a bitch. END
BEGIN NOW You got your eye on my place, just like them. END
BEGIN NOW You come cozying up to me, like I'm gonna hand it over to you. END
BEGIN NOW Well, I'm not that goddamn dumb. END
BEGIN NOW Harold, you ought to do this. END
BEGIN NOW Harold, you ought to do that. END
BEGIN NOW Who the hell are you to tell me about anything? END
BEGIN NOW You stay away from here, and then you come sashaying for what? END
BEGIN NOW Harold. END
BEGIN NOW Now break it up. END
BEGIN NOW Crazy bastard. END
BEGIN NOW Let me alone, damn it. END
BEGIN NOW Everything with Harold is a game. END
BEGIN NOW He plays the clown, he gets everybody to laugh at him. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, no, but he's not laughing. END
BEGIN NOW Everything he does is a result of some calculation. END
BEGIN NOW I just can't believe how sure I was that he changed. END
BEGIN NOW Jess, Harold's always been unpredictable. END
BEGIN NOW I hit him. END
BEGIN NOW I should go talk to him. END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW He rejected you. END
BEGIN NOW Everybody saw him do it. END
BEGIN NOW He's been after you for years. END
BEGIN NOW He's gonna do the same thing to you that you did to him. END
BEGIN NOW He set you up when you got here. END
BEGIN NOW And then he got his revenge. END
BEGIN NOW You can't go back to Harold's now. END
BEGIN NOW Why don't you stay at Daddy's? END
BEGIN NOW The house is just sitting there. END
BEGIN NOW Of course, Jess. END
BEGIN NOW I mean, you wouldn't have to stay in Daddy's room. END
BEGIN NOW You could use my old room, and then... END
BEGIN NOW I mean, after this all blows over, then you could go back home. END
BEGIN NOW Ginny is eternally hopeful. END
BEGIN NOW Ty. END
BEGIN NOW Ginny. END
BEGIN NOW Ginny. END
BEGIN NOW Can I help you, Ken? END
BEGIN NOW These are for you. END
BEGIN NOW You and Ty and Rose and Pete. END
BEGIN NOW You better tell me what they are. END
BEGIN NOW Well, Ginny, your Dad and Caroline are suing you to get the farm back. END
BEGIN NOW You better find yourself a lawyer. END
BEGIN NOW I thought you were our lawyer. END
BEGIN NOW Can't be. END
BEGIN NOW It's not ethical. END
BEGIN NOW Besides, I don't want to be, either. END
BEGIN NOW I don't think you treated your Dad right, to be honest. END
BEGIN NOW We didn't ask for the farm. END
BEGIN NOW I can't talk about the suit, Ginny. END
BEGIN NOW What else is there to talk about? END
BEGIN NOW It drives everything else out, doesn't it? END
BEGIN NOW The thought of Daddy out in that storm is what drives everything else out. END
BEGIN NOW You weren't there. END
BEGIN NOW You don't know what happened, or what it was like. END
BEGIN NOW Daddy was there. END
BEGIN NOW Ty was there. END
BEGIN NOW You talked to Ty? END
BEGIN NOW He was there. END
BEGIN NOW We did everything for you, Rose and I. END
BEGIN NOW We found a way to get you whatever you wanted. END
BEGIN NOW We saved you from Daddy. END
BEGIN NOW I mean, Rose was the one- You saved me? END
BEGIN NOW From my own father? END
BEGIN NOW Look, at this point, I don't really blame you and Rose... for the way you raised me. END
BEGIN NOW I really don't. END
BEGIN NOW Actually, I would like to get into it someday. END
BEGIN NOW I think it would be healthy. END
BEGIN NOW But right now I have a meeting. END
BEGIN NOW Goodbye, Ginny. END
BEGIN NOW When did you talk to Caroline? END
BEGIN NOW Ty. END
BEGIN NOW Why didn't you tell me you talked to Caroline? END
BEGIN NOW I thought she should know about Larry. END
BEGIN NOW Fine. END
BEGIN NOW Look what's happened. END
BEGIN NOW Jess. END
BEGIN NOW Jess. END
BEGIN NOW Hey. END
BEGIN NOW What are you doing? END
BEGIN NOW Did you knock? END
BEGIN NOW I had the radio on. END
BEGIN NOW I guess I haven't seen you in a while. END
BEGIN NOW I missed you. END
BEGIN NOW I love you, Jess. END
BEGIN NOW Wait. END
BEGIN NOW I'll be right down. END
BEGIN NOW Now, just hang on, don't go anywhere. END
BEGIN NOW Ken, don't do this to me. END
BEGIN NOW It's a cease and desist order. END
BEGIN NOW I'm half finished. END
BEGIN NOW I know you are... but its line of credit has been revoked. END
BEGIN NOW I'm sorry. END
BEGIN NOW Come on, how long have you known me? END
BEGIN NOW I'm halfway finished. END
BEGIN NOW It's not doing it to you. END
BEGIN NOW Let me finish before the weather- It's a court order. END
BEGIN NOW You know... How long have you known me? END
BEGIN NOW How long have I done business with this bank? END
BEGIN NOW Look, if it wasn't for this lawsuit thing, you'd have been fine. END
BEGIN NOW I'm sorry, Ty. END
BEGIN NOW So, Marv, you're closing us down. END
BEGIN NOW It wasn't my call, Ginny. END
BEGIN NOW It's just until we get this thing sorted out. END
BEGIN NOW Believe me, it's always difficult... but once the transition's been made... and the older generation's taken care of, in most cases, things go back to normal. END
BEGIN NOW God forbid. END
BEGIN NOW The mismanagement or abuse clause in the transfer agreement... isn't that well defined. END
BEGIN NOW But they'll certainly try to prove abuse and probably mismanagement, too. END
BEGIN NOW So, you've got to farm like model farmers until the hearing date. END
BEGIN NOW And you ladies, wear dresses every day. END
BEGIN NOW And keep the lawn mowed and the porch swept. END
BEGIN NOW You're kidding. END
BEGIN NOW Appearances are everything with a clause like this. END
BEGIN NOW If have to, I'll call some of your neighbours to attest to your skills... and their lawyer will call neighbours to attest to your mistakes. END
BEGIN NOW If you look good, they won't be able to touch you. END
BEGIN NOW That's ridiculous. END
BEGIN NOW It's millions of dollars. END
BEGIN NOW Millions of dollars is never ridiculous. END
BEGIN NOW You got your list, Daddy? END
BEGIN NOW Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW You got money? END
BEGIN NOW Yes, Daddy. END
BEGIN NOW Let me see it. END
BEGIN NOW Well, it's in my wallet. END
BEGIN NOW This is nice. END
BEGIN NOW It's silk. END
BEGIN NOW Yeah, that could look good in court. END
BEGIN NOW Or this one? END
BEGIN NOW Let's sit down. END
BEGIN NOW Come on, sit down here. END
BEGIN NOW Daddy, we should really look for these things. END
BEGIN NOW Come, sit by me. END
BEGIN NOW Remember that brown coat you had? END
BEGIN NOW You were a little birdie girl. END
BEGIN NOW Little hat, too. END
BEGIN NOW Now, that velvet stuff? END
BEGIN NOW Velveteen. END
BEGIN NOW You were my birdie girl, looked like a little house wren. END
BEGIN NOW Did I? END
BEGIN NOW Didn't like it, either. END
BEGIN NOW No, sirree. END
BEGIN NOW Didn't want a brown coat and hat. END
BEGIN NOW Wanted pink, candy pink. END
BEGIN NOW I don't remember. END
BEGIN NOW I remember something red. END
BEGIN NOW A red jacket with hearts. END
BEGIN NOW Couldn't ever keep you away from them drainage wells. END
BEGIN NOW Didn't matter how much we punished you or whipped you. END
BEGIN NOW Like a moth to flame. END
BEGIN NOW My little birdie girl. END
BEGIN NOW I don't remember. END
BEGIN NOW Daddy. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, God. END
BEGIN NOW Rose, what colour was your coat when you were about five or so? END
BEGIN NOW My coat? END
BEGIN NOW Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW It was that brown velveteen thing. END
BEGIN NOW I hated that. END
BEGIN NOW What colour did you want? END
BEGIN NOW Well, pink, probably. END
BEGIN NOW I was crazy about pink for years. END
BEGIN NOW What is... Did Caroline get your coat? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW It wore out. END
BEGIN NOW Mummy cut it up for polishing rags. END
BEGIN NOW I was in Roberta's, and Caroline and Daddy came in. END
BEGIN NOW You know, I can't tell you, the tone... he used on her. END
BEGIN NOW It was soft and affectionate, but there was something underneath. END
BEGIN NOW I thought I'd faint. END
BEGIN NOW Say it. END
BEGIN NOW Say what? END
BEGIN NOW Say it. END
BEGIN NOW It happened like you said. END
BEGIN NOW I remember. END
BEGIN NOW I used to pretend to be asleep. END
BEGIN NOW And how he'd say: Quiet. END
BEGIN NOW Quiet, girl, don't fight me now. END
BEGIN NOW Rose, I remembered the smells. END
BEGIN NOW The whiskey and cigarettes, and the farm smells. END
BEGIN NOW I remember how I'd sort of... just leave my body... so that I wouldn't be there. END
BEGIN NOW So that it wouldn't be me. END
BEGIN NOW Hey. END
BEGIN NOW Hey. END
BEGIN NOW You want a ride? END
BEGIN NOW No, thanks. END
BEGIN NOW I got Pete's Lewis' truck at the th Street bridge. END
BEGIN NOW Better notify his relatives. END
BEGIN NOW Roger that. END
BEGIN NOW Car off, send a tow and an ambulance. END
BEGIN NOW Rose? END
BEGIN NOW Ginny... Pete's crashed the truck, and drowned himself in the ditch. END
BEGIN NOW The girls are still asleep. END
BEGIN NOW Can you go down there? END
BEGIN NOW Aunt Ginny, I wish that Mum would let me baby sit. END
BEGIN NOW She said that if she had to drive me, she'd charge mileage. END
BEGIN NOW Well, that sounds like a joke to me. END
BEGIN NOW Where's Mum? END
BEGIN NOW She'll be back soon, honey. END
BEGIN NOW I'm gonna go watch TV. END
BEGIN NOW Okay. END
BEGIN NOW Girls, I have some bad news. END
BEGIN NOW It's about your father. END
BEGIN NOW This past week has been hell on the kids. END
BEGIN NOW I could come over to your place. END
BEGIN NOW I'm... crazy to get out of this house. END
BEGIN NOW But Pammy keeps waking up... calling for me. END
BEGIN NOW Last night she woke up about every minutes. END
BEGIN NOW I can't sleep anyway. END
BEGIN NOW How are they? END
BEGIN NOW I feel so bad for them. END
BEGIN NOW Well, you've seen them. END
BEGIN NOW They're shell-shocked. END
BEGIN NOW I hate Pete for that. END
BEGIN NOW Shit! END
BEGIN NOW Ginny, you don't know what it was like with Pete. END
BEGIN NOW He told me when I got back from the hospital... that he'd prefer me to keep my nightgown on... if he was in the room. END
BEGIN NOW I'm so tempted to just... walk over there and go in. END
BEGIN NOW What on Earth for? END
BEGIN NOW To get into bed with Jess. END
BEGIN NOW Don't look at me that way. END
BEGIN NOW I can't deal with it. END
BEGIN NOW Ask me a question, any question. END
BEGIN NOW I'll tell you the truth. END
BEGIN NOW Just tell me. END
BEGIN NOW He has this sense of my body. END
BEGIN NOW He looks at it a lot. END
BEGIN NOW You know, he touches it as if... he loves it. END
BEGIN NOW I mean, I know that stops, but while it lasts, I can't- When that stops? END
BEGIN NOW I can't get enough. END
BEGIN NOW Doesn't everything stop? END
BEGIN NOW I mean, isn't that what affairs are all about? END
BEGIN NOW It's not going to stop. END
BEGIN NOW Jess has never settled down, Rose. END
BEGIN NOW He's restless. END
BEGIN NOW He's had a lot of women. END
BEGIN NOW I'd bet on that. END
BEGIN NOW I mean, unless he commits himself- He has. END
BEGIN NOW He's pushing me... to just- To just what? END
BEGIN NOW That's what we can't decide. END
BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW Where? END
BEGIN NOW Did you tell Pete about Jess? END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW And what did he say? END
BEGIN NOW That he was going to kill Daddy. END
BEGIN NOW Daddy? END
BEGIN NOW He blamed Daddy for everything that went wrong in our lives. END
BEGIN NOW When you got right down to it, he was jealous as hell. END
BEGIN NOW But he was too weak. END
BEGIN NOW Couldn't actually do anything up front, just threaten. END
BEGIN NOW Shit, Ginny, at the core, they're all like that. END
BEGIN NOW We just think that way because of Daddy. END
BEGIN NOW I mean... if he hadn't... Say the words, Ginny. END
BEGIN NOW If he hadn't have beat us and fucked us... we'd think differently, right? END
BEGIN NOW But he did. END
BEGIN NOW And what kills me is this person... who can beat and fuck his own daughters... can go into the community... and get respect and power... and take it for granted that he deserves it. END
BEGIN NOW He's respected, and people say what bitches we are. END
BEGIN NOW And that's that, end of history. END
BEGIN NOW I can't stand that. END
BEGIN NOW I was thinking, leaving here... Jess and me, was the only alternative... but I don't want to leave here. END
BEGIN NOW I want what was Daddy's. END
BEGIN NOW I want it. END
BEGIN NOW I think I paid for it, don't you? END
BEGIN NOW You think a breast weighs a pound? END
BEGIN NOW That's my pound of flesh. END
BEGIN NOW Okay, here's a question for you. END
BEGIN NOW Did you know I'd slept with Jess? END
BEGIN NOW Sure. END
BEGIN NOW Had you slept with him by that time? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW But he told you. END
BEGIN NOW At some point, a while ago. END
BEGIN NOW I guess that means... he and I don't have anything private together. END
BEGIN NOW Selling the sows will tide us over until after harvest. END
BEGIN NOW I've got to think about the payment on that loan. END
BEGIN NOW It's not gonna take care of itself. END
BEGIN NOW I thought we earmarked the rent from your place for that. END
BEGIN NOW That's gonna get eaten up at harvest. END
BEGIN NOW The lawyer isn't gonna be cheap, either. END
BEGIN NOW Gotta find it somewhere. END
BEGIN NOW We're lucky to get three-fourths of what these sows are worth. END
BEGIN NOW They're prime breeding stock, but what choice is there? END
BEGIN NOW Ms. Cook, when were your suspicions aroused... about this plan going on for the division of the Cook farm? END
BEGIN NOW I was suspicious from the first. END
BEGIN NOW The whole project was very atypical for my father... and I made my reservations known. END
BEGIN NOW And how were your reservations greeted? END
BEGIN NOW My sister, Ginny Smith, urged me very strongly to go along with the plan. END
BEGIN NOW What did you think of that? END
BEGIN NOW Well, I suspected her of ulterior motives. END
BEGIN NOW I know both she and Rose have wanted to get their hands on the property. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, my God, listen to this. END
BEGIN NOW Objection, your honour. END
BEGIN NOW Quiet, Mrs. Lewis. END
BEGIN NOW The objection is sustained. END
BEGIN NOW Mr. Ty Smith told you that your sisters... sent your father out into a terrible storm, did he not? END
BEGIN NOW Yes, he did. END
BEGIN NOW He did? END
BEGIN NOW It was common knowledge that my father was out in that storm. END
BEGIN NOW I'm not surprised. END
BEGIN NOW Ms. Cook, the relationship between your father and your sisters... is irrelevant in this case. END
BEGIN NOW The mismanagement or abuse clause in the preincorporation agreement... refers to the farm properties only. END
BEGIN NOW Ms. Cook? END
BEGIN NOW In the past, had the Cook farm ever incurred debt? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW Is it now burdened with debt? END
BEGIN NOW Yes, it certainly is. END
BEGIN NOW No further questions. END
BEGIN NOW No questions. END
BEGIN NOW Witness is excused. END
BEGIN NOW So, work crews were doing very long hours overtime? END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW In order to push the work past the point of no return? END
BEGIN NOW Objection, your honour. END
BEGIN NOW Sustained. END
BEGIN NOW Rephrase, Counsel. END
BEGIN NOW Everything was done in a rush, right? END
BEGIN NOW Well, the sooner the work was finished, the sooner we'd start earning. END
BEGIN NOW Didn't you tell your husband, Ty Smith... that the big dollars being spent made you giddy? END
BEGIN NOW Did you tell your husband... the big dollars being spent made you giddy? END
BEGIN NOW Yes, but that was- In other words, you and your husband were way overextended... and you both knew it. END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW Your honour, at this time, I'd like to call Mr. Larry Cook to the stand. END
BEGIN NOW He's been saving it all up for this moment. END
BEGIN NOW Brace yourself. END
BEGIN NOW Mr. Cook, did you in good faith... form a corporation and relinquish your farm to your two older daughters... Rose Cook Lewis and Virginia Cook Smith... and their husbands, Tyler Smith and Peter Lewis? END
BEGIN NOW Mr. Cook? END
BEGIN NOW By God, they'll starve. END
BEGIN NOW The land won't produce for the likes of them. END
BEGIN NOW Larry, did you sign the farm over to Ginny and Rose? END
BEGIN NOW I don't care about going to gaol. END
BEGIN NOW Nobody's going to gaol, Larry. END
BEGIN NOW It isn't that kind of trial. END
BEGIN NOW We're talking about the farm. END
BEGIN NOW Your farm. END
BEGIN NOW The one your dad and granddad built. END
BEGIN NOW What happened to it? END
BEGIN NOW It was all underwater. END
BEGIN NOW I told them that. END
BEGIN NOW Every last bit of it, underwater. END
BEGIN NOW We laid the tiles. END
BEGIN NOW Dug the drainage well. END
BEGIN NOW No machinery, did it all by hand. END
BEGIN NOW My granddad, my dad... then me. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, your farm. END
BEGIN NOW My farm. END
BEGIN NOW What'd you do with it? END
BEGIN NOW I lost it. END
BEGIN NOW How? END
BEGIN NOW Larry, listen to me. END
BEGIN NOW What happened to the farm? END
BEGIN NOW Who'd you give it to? END
BEGIN NOW Them! END
BEGIN NOW Them bitches! END
BEGIN NOW The whole lot of them. END
BEGIN NOW Here it comes. END
BEGIN NOW Mr. Cook? END
BEGIN NOW Larry? END
BEGIN NOW She's dead, you know. END
BEGIN NOW Who's dead, Mr. Cook? END
BEGIN NOW My daughter. END
BEGIN NOW Which daughter? END
BEGIN NOW All of your daughters are in this courtroom, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Caroline! END
BEGIN NOW Caroline's dead. END
BEGIN NOW I think they stole the body and buried it already. END
BEGIN NOW Look, Daddy, I'm right here. END
BEGIN NOW Judge, here's exhibit A, the contract in question. END
BEGIN NOW I'll introduce that in lieu of the witness's response. END
BEGIN NOW Could be... Daddy?\...they killed her that day after church. END
BEGIN NOW She didn't show up to get her share. END
BEGIN NOW Then when I went down to Des Moines to find her, she wasn't there. END
BEGIN NOW Daddy. END
BEGIN NOW You're a judge. END
BEGIN NOW I'll swear that maybe they killed her and buried her. END
BEGIN NOW Daddy, I'm right here. END
BEGIN NOW Now, you help me up, boy. END
BEGIN NOW I can't do like I used to. END
BEGIN NOW Excuse me. END
BEGIN NOW The sweetest, lightest, happiest little bird. END
BEGIN NOW All day long, she would sing some little song. END
BEGIN NOW Little bitty fingers always dropping things through the well grate. END
BEGIN NOW Daddy, that was Rose! END
BEGIN NOW It was Rose who dropped things through the grate. END
BEGIN NOW It was Rose who sang. END
BEGIN NOW It was. END
BEGIN NOW I don't feel I need to take a recess to decide this matter. END
BEGIN NOW The arguments are fairly clear, and the plaintiffs have failed to establish... either abuse of the property or mismanagement of its assets. END
BEGIN NOW The fact is, in this state, if you legally sign over your property... it's very hard to change your mind and get it back. END
BEGIN NOW I find in favour of the defendants, Mrs. Lewis, Mrs. Smith and Mr. Smith. END
BEGIN NOW Court is adjourned. END
BEGIN NOW He doesn't even know he lost the farm. END
BEGIN NOW What do you want Rose, blood? END
BEGIN NOW I want him to know. END
BEGIN NOW Daddy? END
BEGIN NOW You lost. END
BEGIN NOW Do you hear me? END
BEGIN NOW Come on. END
BEGIN NOW He doesn't even know. END
BEGIN NOW One thing we could get would be a new range. END
BEGIN NOW This thing is a menace. END
BEGIN NOW I don't necessarily think this is the right time for us... to be getting a new range. END
BEGIN NOW Maybe it'll blow up and put us out of our misery. END
BEGIN NOW I'll bring the range over from your father's house tomorrow. END
BEGIN NOW It's pretty new. END
BEGIN NOW Or we could move over there. END
BEGIN NOW I am the oldest. END
BEGIN NOW That house is too big for us. END
BEGIN NOW Well, it was built to be big. END
BEGIN NOW It was built to show off. END
BEGIN NOW Maybe I've inherited my turn to show off. END
BEGIN NOW I think you've shown off plenty this summer, frankly. END
BEGIN NOW I need $ , I asked for $ , That's all I wanted. END
BEGIN NOW A dollar an acre. END
BEGIN NOW I've given my life to this place. END
BEGIN NOW Now it's yours. END
BEGIN NOW I didn't know where I was going. END
BEGIN NOW All I knew was that I had to leave. END
BEGIN NOW Going to court had divided us from each other and from our old lives. END
BEGIN NOW There was nothing here for me any longer. END
BEGIN NOW The hardest part was leaving Rose. END
BEGIN NOW All our lives, we'd looked out for each other... in that way that motherless children tend to do. END
BEGIN NOW I was afraid of leaving her alone with her anger and her hate. END
BEGIN NOW Rose. END
BEGIN NOW I'd always assumed we would be together forever... on this thousand acres. END
BEGIN NOW It took me six months to address a note to Rose, telling her where I was. END
BEGIN NOW When she wrote back, I was afraid to read it, so I threw it in a drawer. END
BEGIN NOW A year later, I still couldn't read her letters. END
BEGIN NOW More coffee? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW Coffee? END
BEGIN NOW Is breakfast okay? END
BEGIN NOW Can I get you something? END
BEGIN NOW Hello, Ginny. END
BEGIN NOW Ty. END
BEGIN NOW It's from the girls. END
BEGIN NOW Thanks. END
BEGIN NOW I'm going to Texas, Ginny. END
BEGIN NOW I thought I'd get myself a job in one of those big hog places down there. END
BEGIN NOW Those hog buildings killed me. END
BEGIN NOW The winter after the trial was so bad- It was a hearing, nobody was on trial. END
BEGIN NOW I was. END
BEGIN NOW What about Rose? END
BEGIN NOW Rose. END
BEGIN NOW She's moved over into your father's house. END
BEGIN NOW I've signed everything. END
BEGIN NOW The land, buildings, hogs, the equipment. END
BEGIN NOW I signed the whole lot over to her. END
BEGIN NOW She's sure she's gonna be some kind of land baroness. END
BEGIN NOW Got it all figured out, the way she always does. END
BEGIN NOW She goes around like some queen. END
BEGIN NOW Frankly, she's your dad all over. END
BEGIN NOW Where is he now? END
BEGIN NOW Caroline took him in. END
BEGIN NOW He's living with her. END
BEGIN NOW I know what Rose says, Ginny, about your dad. END
BEGIN NOW She told me. END
BEGIN NOW She's told everybody by now. END
BEGIN NOW No one believes her. END
BEGIN NOW I think people should keep private things private. END
BEGIN NOW I hated all that mess. END
BEGIN NOW I hated the way Rose roped you in. END
BEGIN NOW You took Caroline's side. END
BEGIN NOW You talked to Caroline about me. END
BEGIN NOW I took the farm's side. END
BEGIN NOW That's all. END
BEGIN NOW I guess we see things differently. END
BEGIN NOW More than you can imagine. END
BEGIN NOW I've gotta get back to work. END
BEGIN NOW Gotta have the last word? END
BEGIN NOW You have it, I don't care. END
BEGIN NOW I don't remember you like this. END
BEGIN NOW I wasn't like this. END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW You looked on the good side of things. END
BEGIN NOW You were pretty and funny. END
BEGIN NOW I was a ninny. END
BEGIN NOW I was a simpleton. END
BEGIN NOW Hello, Denny's. END
BEGIN NOW Does Ginny Cook work there? END
BEGIN NOW Yes, she does. END
BEGIN NOW Ginny. END
BEGIN NOW Phone call. END
BEGIN NOW Hello? END
BEGIN NOW Aunt Ginny, Mummy's in the hospital. END
BEGIN NOW She wanted the whole lot, Ginny. END
BEGIN NOW We gave it to her. END
BEGIN NOW A second radical mastectomy, all the chemo her body could take. END
BEGIN NOW But it's just way too advanced. END
BEGIN NOW God knows, though, she's a fighter. END
BEGIN NOW Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW Come on, I'll take you to her. END
BEGIN NOW Take the girls back with you. END
BEGIN NOW You mean... END
BEGIN NOW Promise me you'll take them. END
BEGIN NOW Of course I'll take them. END
BEGIN NOW Tomorrow, we'll talk about when. END
BEGIN NOW Okay. END
BEGIN NOW Go home, make them some dinner. END
BEGIN NOW Make them some fried chicken. END
BEGIN NOW They had no idea that their mother wasn't coming home. END
BEGIN NOW And I couldn't tell them. END
BEGIN NOW Not yet. END
BEGIN NOW I realised I'd had nothing to offer Pammy and Linda... on the occasion of their father's death... since I had learned nothing on the occasion of my mother's. END
BEGIN NOW Aunt Ginny. END
BEGIN NOW Rose was going to die and they would know it soon enough. END
BEGIN NOW I've often thought that the death of a parent is the one misfortune... for which there is no compensation. END
BEGIN NOW You've grown. END
BEGIN NOW Look at you both. END
BEGIN NOW You've grown so much. END
BEGIN NOW What she told me was... for me to come and make you fried chicken. END
BEGIN NOW We're vegetarians. END
BEGIN NOW But we eat meat at school sometimes. END
BEGIN NOW And we go to Kentucky Fried sometimes. END
BEGIN NOW So should I make you mashed potatoes and gravy? END
BEGIN NOW Yes, please. END
BEGIN NOW Take these, honey. END
BEGIN NOW Is my apron still here? END
BEGIN NOW Hey. END
BEGIN NOW I'm gonna bring the girls by later. END
BEGIN NOW No, it's a long way. END
BEGIN NOW I didn't leave everything unsaid with the girls... the way Mummy did with us. END
BEGIN NOW I laid it out for them when I saw what was happening. END
BEGIN NOW I'm glad about that. END
BEGIN NOW I'm impressed by the way you've tied up all the loose ends. END
BEGIN NOW Bossy till the end. END
BEGIN NOW Are you looking for a way to hurt my feelings? END
BEGIN NOW Probably. END
BEGIN NOW Still fighting over a man? END
BEGIN NOW For every one thought I've had about Ty, I've had about Jess. END
BEGIN NOW Eventually, you'd have gotten fed up. END
BEGIN NOW Did you? END
BEGIN NOW Almost. END
BEGIN NOW I would've, but he left when I got sick. END
BEGIN NOW Ginny, I want to tell you some things, some practical things. END
BEGIN NOW I'm leaving the farm to you and Caroline... not to the girls. END
BEGIN NOW I want all of this to stop with our generation. END
BEGIN NOW Rose, I don't wanna farm. END
BEGIN NOW You won't have to. END
BEGIN NOW Marv Carson will make you sell to the Midwestern Corporation. END
BEGIN NOW I don't know what there's gonna be... above and beyond the debt and the taxes. END
BEGIN NOW No, don't do that to me. END
BEGIN NOW We're not going to be sad. END
BEGIN NOW We're going to be angry until we die. END
BEGIN NOW It's hard to bear, Rose. END
BEGIN NOW Are you okay? END
BEGIN NOW Well, I better go before the girls get home. END
BEGIN NOW What am I gonna do without you? END
BEGIN NOW Exercise caution while making up your own mind, as always. END
BEGIN NOW Ginny. END
BEGIN NOW I don't have any accomplishments. END
BEGIN NOW I didn't make a good life with Pete. END
BEGIN NOW I didn't see the girls into adulthood. END
BEGIN NOW I didn't keep Jess. END
BEGIN NOW I didn't work the farm successfully. END
BEGIN NOW I didn't even get Daddy to know what he did... or what it means. END
BEGIN NOW And all the people around town talk about how I wrecked it all. END
BEGIN NOW Three generations on the same land, great land. END
BEGIN NOW Daddy, a marvellous farmer and a saint to boot. END
BEGIN NOW So, all I have is... that I saw. END
BEGIN NOW That I saw without being afraid... and without turning away. END
BEGIN NOW And that I didn't forgive the unforgivable. END
BEGIN NOW That's my sole, solitary, and lonely accomplishment. END
BEGIN NOW That's something, isn't it? END
BEGIN NOW Caroline. END
BEGIN NOW Tell her about Daddy. END
BEGIN NOW Rose died that afternoon. END
BEGIN NOW Let us say that each vanished person left me something... and that I feel my inheritance when I'm reminded of them. END
BEGIN NOW Anger itself reminds me of Rose. END
BEGIN NOW But so do most of the women I see on the street... who wear dresses she would've liked... and carry their children on their hips with that swaying grace she had. END
BEGIN NOW Rose left me a riddle I haven't solved... of how we judge those who have hurt us... when they have shown no remorse, or even understanding. END
BEGIN NOW Remorse reminds me of Daddy, who had none. END
BEGIN NOW At least, none for me. END
BEGIN NOW I didn't tell Caroline about Daddy. END
BEGIN NOW I could've told her everything. END
BEGIN NOW I could've poured the truth right over her. END
BEGIN NOW But it would've been Rose's truth, not mine. END
BEGIN NOW Daddy died of a heart attack that next spring. END
BEGIN NOW Our thousand acres were taken over by a giant agricultural corporation. END
BEGIN NOW The houses were bulldozed to make room for more crops. END
BEGIN NOW And although the farm and all of its gifts and burdens are scattered now... my inheritance is with me in Rose's children. END
BEGIN NOW As each year goes by, I watch them grow. END
BEGIN NOW And in them, I see something new. END
BEGIN NOW Something my sister and I never had. END
BEGIN NOW I see hope.  END
BEGIN NOW  Vauquer (_nee_ de Conflans) is an elderly person, who for the past forty years has kept a lodging-house in the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve, in the district that lies between the Latin Quarter and the Faubourg Saint-Marcel. END
BEGIN NOW Her house (known in the neighborhood as the _Maison Vauquer_) receives men and women, old and young, and no word has ever been breathed against her respectable establishment; but, at the same time, it must be said that as a matter of fact no young woman has been under her roof for thirty years, and that if a young man stays there for any length of time it is a sure sign that his allowance must be of the slenderest. END
BEGIN NOW In , however, the time when this drama opens, there was an almost penniless young girl among Vauquer's boarders. END
BEGIN NOW That word drama has been somewhat discredited of late; it has been overworked and twisted to strange uses in these days of dolorous literature; but it must do service again here, not because this story is dramatic in the restricted sense of the word, but because some tears may perhaps be shed _intra et extra muros_ before it is over. END
BEGIN NOW Will any one without the walls of Paris understand it? END
BEGIN NOW It is open to doubt. END
BEGIN NOW The only audience who could appreciate the results of close observation, the careful reproduction of minute detail and local color, are dwellers between the heights of Montrouge and Montmartre, in a vale of crumbling stucco watered by streams of black mud, a vale of sorrows which are real and joys too often hollow; but this audience is so accustomed to terrible sensations, that only some unimaginable and well-neigh impossible woe could produce any lasting impression there. END
BEGIN NOW Now and again there are tragedies so awful and so grand by reason of the complication of virtues and vices that bring them about, that egotism and selfishness are forced to pause and are moved to pity; but the impression that they receive is like a luscious fruit, soon consumed. END
BEGIN NOW Civilization, like the car of Juggernaut, is scarcely stayed perceptibly in its progress by a heart less easy to break than the others that lie in its course; this also is broken, and Civilization continues on her course triumphant. END
BEGIN NOW And you, too, will do the like; you who with this book in your white hand will sink back among the cushions of your armchair, and say to yourself, Perhaps this may amuse me. END
BEGIN NOW You will read the story of Father Goriot's secret woes, and, dining thereafter with an unspoiled appetite, will lay the blame of your insensibility upon the writer, and accuse him of exaggeration, of writing romances. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW once for all, this drama is neither a fiction nor a romance! END
BEGIN NOW _All is true_,&mdash;so true, that every one can discern the elements of the tragedy in his own house, perhaps in his own heart. END
BEGIN NOW The lodging-house is Vauquer's own property. END
BEGIN NOW It is still standing in the lower end of the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve, just where the road slopes so sharply down to the Rue de l'Arbalete, that wheeled traffic seldom passes that way, because it is so stony and steep. END
BEGIN NOW This position is sufficient to account for the silence prevalent in the streets shut in between the dome of the Pantheon and the dome of the Val-de-Grace, two conspicuous public buildings which give a yellowish tone to the landscape and darken the whole district that lies beneath the shadow of their leaden-hued cupolas. END
BEGIN NOW In that district the pavements are clean and dry, there is neither mud nor water in the gutters, grass grows in the chinks of the walls. END
BEGIN NOW The most heedless passer-by feels the depressing influences of a place where the sound of wheels creates a sensation; there is a grim look about the houses, a suggestion of a jail about those high garden walls. END
BEGIN NOW A Parisian straying into a suburb apparently composed of lodging-houses and public institutions would see poverty and dullness, old age lying down to die, and joyous youth condemned to drudgery. END
BEGIN NOW It is the ugliest quarter of Paris, and, it may be added, the least known. END
BEGIN NOW But, before all things, the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve is like a bronze frame for a picture for which the mind cannot be too well prepared by the contemplation of sad hues and sober images. END
BEGIN NOW Even so, step by step the daylight decreases, and the cicerone's droning voice grows hollower as the traveler descends into the Catacombs. END
BEGIN NOW The comparison holds good! END
BEGIN NOW Who shall say which is more ghastly, the sight of the bleached skulls or of dried-up human hearts? END
BEGIN NOW The front of the lodging-house is at right angles to the road, and looks out upon a little garden, so that you see the side of the house in section, as it were, from the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve. END
BEGIN NOW Beneath the wall of the house front there lies a channel, a fathom wide, paved with cobble-stones, and beside it runs a graveled walk bordered by geraniums and oleanders and pomegranates set in great blue and white glazed earthenware pots. END
BEGIN NOW Access into the graveled walk is afforded by a door, above which the words MAISON VAUQUER may be read, and beneath, in rather smaller letters, _Lodgings for both sexes, etc._ During the day a glimpse into the garden is easily obtained through a wicket to which a bell is attached. END
BEGIN NOW On the opposite wall, at the further end of the graveled walk, a green marble arch was painted once upon a time by a local artist, and in this semblance of a shrine a statue representing Cupid is installed; a Parisian Cupid, so blistered and disfigured that he looks like a candidate for one of the adjacent hospitals, and might suggest an allegory to lovers of symbolism. END
BEGIN NOW The half-obliterated inscription on the pedestal beneath determines the date of this work of art, for it bears witness to the widespread enthusiasm felt for Voltaire on his return to Paris in : Whoe'er thou art, thy master see; He is, or was, or ought to be. END
BEGIN NOW At night the wicket gate is replaced by a solid door. END
BEGIN NOW The little garden is no wider than the front of the house; it is shut in between the wall of the street and the partition wall of the neighboring house. END
BEGIN NOW A mantle of ivy conceals the bricks and attracts the eyes of passers-by to an effect which is picturesque in Paris, for each of the walls is covered with trellised vines that yield a scanty dusty crop of fruit, and furnish besides a subject of conversation for Vauquer and her lodgers; every year the widow trembles for her vintage. END
BEGIN NOW A straight path beneath the walls on either side of the garden leads to a clump of lime-trees at the further end of it; _line_-trees, as Vauquer persists in calling them, in spite of the fact that she was a de Conflans, and regardless of repeated corrections from her lodgers. END
BEGIN NOW The central space between the walls is filled with artichokes and rows of pyramid fruit-trees, and surrounded by a border of lettuce, pot-herbs, and parsley. END
BEGIN NOW Under the lime-trees there are a few green-painted garden seats and a wooden table, and hither, during the dog-days, such of the lodgers as are rich enough to indulge in a cup of coffee come to take their pleasure, though it is hot enough to roast eggs even in the shade. END
BEGIN NOW The house itself is three stories high, without counting the attics under the roof. END
BEGIN NOW It is built of rough stone, and covered with the yellowish stucco that gives a mean appearance to almost every house in Paris. END
BEGIN NOW There are five windows in each story in the front of the house; all the blinds visible through the small square panes are drawn up awry, so that the lines are all at cross purposes. END
BEGIN NOW At the side of the house there are but two windows on each floor, and the lowest of all are adorned with a heavy iron grating. END
BEGIN NOW Behind the house a yard extends for some twenty feet, a space inhabited by a happy family of pigs, poultry, and rabbits; the wood-shed is situated on the further side, and on the wall between the wood-shed and the kitchen window hangs the meat-safe, just above the place where the sink discharges its greasy streams. END
BEGIN NOW The cook sweeps all the refuse out through a little door into the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve, and frequently cleanses the yard with copious supplies of water, under pain of pestilence. END
BEGIN NOW The house might have been built on purpose for its present uses. END
BEGIN NOW Access is given by a French window to the first room on the ground floor, a sitting-room which looks out upon the street through the two barred windows already mentioned. END
BEGIN NOW Another door opens out of it into the dining-room, which is separated from the kitchen by the well of the staircase, the steps being constructed partly of wood, partly of tiles, which are colored and beeswaxed. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing can be more depressing than the sight of that sitting-room. END
BEGIN NOW The furniture is covered with horse hair woven in alternate dull and glossy stripes. END
BEGIN NOW There is a round table in the middle, with a purplish-red marble top, on which there stands, by way of ornament, the inevitable white china tea-service, covered with a half-effaced gilt network. END
BEGIN NOW The floor is sufficiently uneven, the wainscot rises to elbow height, and the rest of the wall space is decorated with a varnished paper, on which the principal scenes from _Telemaque_ are depicted, the various classical personages being colored. END
BEGIN NOW The subject between the two windows is the banquet given by Calypso to the son of Ulysses, displayed thereon for the admiration of the boarders, and has furnished jokes these forty years to the young men who show themselves superior to their position by making fun of the dinners to which poverty condemns them. END
BEGIN NOW The hearth is always so clean and neat that it is evident that a fire is only kindled there on great occasions; the stone chimney-piece is adorned by a couple of vases filled with faded artificial flowers imprisoned under glass shades, on either side of a bluish marble clock in the very worst taste. END
BEGIN NOW The first room exhales an odor for which there is no name in the language, and which should be called the _odeur de pension_. END
BEGIN NOW The damp atmosphere sends a chill through you as you breathe it; it has a stuffy, musty, and rancid quality; it permeates your clothing; after-dinner scents seem to be mingled in it with smells from the kitchen and scullery and the reek of a hospital. END
BEGIN NOW It might be possible to describe it if some one should discover a process by which to distil from the atmosphere all the nauseating elements with which it is charged by the catarrhal exhalations of every individual lodger, young or old. END
BEGIN NOW Yet, in spite of these stale horrors, the sitting-room is as charming and as delicately perfumed as a boudoir, when compared with the adjoining dining-room. END
BEGIN NOW The paneled walls of that apartment were once painted some color, now a matter of conjecture, for the surface is incrusted with accumulated layers of grimy deposit, which cover it with fantastic outlines. END
BEGIN NOW A collection of dim-ribbed glass decanters, metal discs with a satin sheen on them, and piles of blue-edged earthenware plates of Touraine ware cover the sticky surfaces of the sideboards that line the room. END
BEGIN NOW In a corner stands a box containing a set of numbered pigeon-holes, in which the lodgers' table napkins, more or less soiled and stained with wine, are kept. END
BEGIN NOW Here you see that indestructible furniture never met with elsewhere, which finds its way into lodging-houses much as the wrecks of our civilization drift into hospitals for incurables. END
BEGIN NOW You expect in such places as these to find the weather-house whence a Capuchin issues on wet days; you look to find the execrable engravings which spoil your appetite, framed every one in a black varnished frame, with a gilt beading round it; you know the sort of tortoise-shell clock-case, inlaid with brass; the green stove, the Argand lamps, covered with oil and dust, have met your eyes before. END
BEGIN NOW The oilcloth which covers the long table is so greasy that a waggish _externe_ will write his name on the surface, using his thumb-nail as a style. END
BEGIN NOW The chairs are broken-down invalids; the wretched little hempen mats slip away from under your feet without slipping away for good; and finally, the foot-warmers are miserable wrecks, hingeless, charred, broken away about the holes. END
BEGIN NOW It would be impossible to give an idea of the old, rotten, shaky, cranky, worm-eaten, halt, maimed, one-eyed, rickety, and ramshackle condition of the furniture without an exhaustive description, which would delay the progress of the story to an extent that impatient people would not pardon. END
BEGIN NOW The red tiles of the floor are full of depressions brought about by scouring and periodical renewings of color. END
BEGIN NOW In short, there is no illusory grace left to the poverty that reigns here; it is dire, parsimonious, concentrated, threadbare poverty; as yet it has not sunk into the mire, it is only splashed by it, and though not in rags as yet, its clothing is ready to drop to pieces. END
BEGIN NOW This apartment is in all its glory at seven o'clock in the morning, when Vauquer's cat appears, announcing the near approach of his mistress, and jumps upon the sideboards to sniff at the milk in the bowls, each protected by a plate, while he purrs his morning greeting to the world. END
BEGIN NOW A moment later the widow shows her face; she is tricked out in a net cap attached to a false front set on awry, and shuffles into the room in her slipshod fashion. END
BEGIN NOW She is an oldish woman, with a bloated countenance, and a nose like a parrot's beak set in the middle of it; her fat little hands (she is as sleek as a church rat) and her shapeless, slouching figure are in keeping with the room that reeks of misfortune, where hope is reduced to speculate for the meanest stakes. END
BEGIN NOW Vauquer alone can breathe that tainted air without being disheartened by it. END
BEGIN NOW Her face is as fresh as a frosty morning in autumn; there are wrinkles about the eyes that vary in their expression from the set smile of a ballet-dancer to the dark, suspicious scowl of a discounter of bills; in short, she is at once the embodiment and interpretation of her lodging-house, as surely as her lodging-house implies the existence of its mistress. END
BEGIN NOW You can no more imagine the one without the other, than you can think of a jail without a turnkey. END
BEGIN NOW The unwholesome corpulence of the little woman is produced by the life she leads, just as typhus fever is bred in the tainted air of a hospital. END
BEGIN NOW The very knitted woolen petticoat that she wears beneath a skirt made of an old gown, with the wadding protruding through the rents in the material, is a sort of epitome of the sitting-room, the dining-room, and the little garden; it discovers the cook, it foreshadows the lodgers&mdash;the picture of the house is completed by the portrait of its mistress. END
BEGIN NOW Vauquer at the age of fifty is like all women who have seen a deal of trouble. END
BEGIN NOW She has the glassy eyes and innocent air of a trafficker in flesh and blood, who will wax virtuously indignant to obtain a higher price for her services, but who is quite ready to betray a Georges or a Pichegru, if a Georges or a Pichegru were in hiding and still to be betrayed, or for any other expedient that may alleviate her lot. END
BEGIN NOW Still, she is a good woman at bottom, said the lodgers who believed that the widow was wholly dependent upon the money that they paid her, and sympathized when they heard her cough and groan like one of themselves. END
BEGIN NOW What had M. Vauquer been? END
BEGIN NOW The lady was never very explicit on this head. END
BEGIN NOW How had she lost her money? END
BEGIN NOW Through trouble, was her answer. END
BEGIN NOW He had treated her badly, had left her nothing but her eyes to cry over his cruelty, the house she lived in, and the privilege of pitying nobody, because, so she was wont to say, she herself had been through every possible misfortune. END
BEGIN NOW Sylvie, the stout cook, hearing her mistress' shuffling footsteps, hastened to serve the lodgers' breakfasts. END
BEGIN NOW Beside those who lived in the house, Vauquer took boarders who came for their meals; but these _externes_ usually only came to dinner, for which they paid thirty francs a month. END
BEGIN NOW At the time when this story begins, the lodging-house contained seven inmates. END
BEGIN NOW The best rooms in the house were on the first story, Vauquer herself occupying the least important, while the rest were let to a Couture, the widow of a commissary-general in the service of the Republic. END
BEGIN NOW With her lived Victorine Taillefer, a schoolgirl, to whom she filled the place of mother. END
BEGIN NOW These two ladies paid eighteen hundred francs a year. END
BEGIN NOW The two sets of rooms on the second floor were respectively occupied by an old man named Poiret and a man of forty or thereabouts, the wearer of a black wig and dyed whiskers, who gave out that he was a retired merchant, and was addressed as M. Vautrin. END
BEGIN NOW Two of the four rooms on the third floor were also let&mdash;one to an elderly spinster, a Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau, and the other to a retired manufacturer of vermicelli, Italian paste and starch, who allowed the others to address him as Father Goriot. END
BEGIN NOW The remaining rooms were allotted to various birds of passage, to impecunious students, who like Father Goriot and Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau, could only muster forty-five francs a month to pay for their board and lodging. END
BEGIN NOW Vauquer had little desire for lodgers of this sort; they ate too much bread, and she only took them in default of better. END
BEGIN NOW At that time one of the rooms was tenanted by a law student, a young man from the neighborhood of Angouleme, one of a large family who pinched and starved themselves to spare twelve hundred francs a year for him. END
BEGIN NOW Misfortune had accustomed Eugene de Rastignac, for that was his name, to work. END
BEGIN NOW He belonged to the number of young men who know as children that their parents' hopes are centered on them, and deliberately prepare themselves for a great career, subordinating their studies from the first to this end, carefully watching the indications of the course of events, calculating the probable turn that affairs will take, that they may be the first to profit by them. END
BEGIN NOW But for his observant curiosity, and the skill with which he managed to introduce himself into the salons of Paris, this story would not have been colored by the tones of truth which it certainly owes to him, for they are entirely due to his penetrating sagacity and desire to fathom the mysteries of an appalling condition of things, which was concealed as carefully by the victim as by those who had brought it to pass. END
BEGIN NOW Above the third story there was a garret where the linen was hung to dry, and a couple of attics. END
BEGIN NOW Christophe, the man-of-all-work, slept in one, and Sylvie, the stout cook, in the other. END
BEGIN NOW Beside the seven inmates thus enumerated, taking one year with another, some eight law or medical students dined in the house, as well as two or three regular comers who lived in the neighborhood. END
BEGIN NOW There were usually eighteen people at dinner, and there was room, if need be, for twenty at Vauquer's table; at breakfast, however, only the seven lodgers appeared. END
BEGIN NOW It was almost like a family party. END
BEGIN NOW Every one came down in dressing-gown and slippers, and the conversation usually turned on anything that had happened the evening before; comments on the dress or appearance of the dinner contingent were exchanged in friendly confidence. END
BEGIN NOW These seven lodgers were Vauquer's spoiled children. END
BEGIN NOW Among them she distributed, with astronomical precision, the exact proportion of respect and attention due to the varying amounts they paid for their board. END
BEGIN NOW One single consideration influenced all these human beings thrown together by chance. END
BEGIN NOW The two second-floor lodgers only paid seventy-two francs a month. END
BEGIN NOW Such prices as these are confined to the Faubourg Saint-Marcel and the district between La Bourbe and the Salpetriere; and, as might be expected, poverty, more or less apparent, weighed upon them all, Couture being the sole exception to the rule. END
BEGIN NOW The dreary surroundings were reflected in the costumes of the inmates of the house; all were alike threadbare. END
BEGIN NOW The color of the men's coats were problematical; such shoes, in more fashionable quarters, are only to be seen lying in the gutter; the cuffs and collars were worn and frayed at the edges; every limp article of clothing looked like the ghost of its former self. END
BEGIN NOW The women's dresses were faded, old-fashioned, dyed and re-dyed; they wore gloves that were glazed with hard wear, much-mended lace, dingy ruffles, crumpled muslin fichus. END
BEGIN NOW So much for their clothing; but, for the most part, their frames were solid enough; their constitutions had weathered the storms of life; their cold, hard faces were worn like coins that have been withdrawn from circulation, but there were greedy teeth behind the withered lips. END
BEGIN NOW Dramas brought to a close or still in progress are foreshadowed by the sight of such actors as these, not the dramas that are played before the footlights and against a background of painted canvas, but dumb dramas of life, frost-bound dramas that sere hearts like fire, dramas that do not end with the actors' lives. END
BEGIN NOW Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau, that elderly young lady, screened her weak eyes from the daylight by a soiled green silk shade with a rim of brass, an object fit to scare away the Angel of Pity himself. END
BEGIN NOW Her shawl, with its scanty, draggled fringe, might have covered a skeleton, so meagre and angular was the form beneath it. END
BEGIN NOW Yet she must have been pretty and shapely once. END
BEGIN NOW What corrosive had destroyed the feminine outlines? END
BEGIN NOW Was it trouble, or vice, or greed? END
BEGIN NOW Had she loved too well? END
BEGIN NOW Had she been a second-hand clothes dealer, a frequenter of the backstairs of great houses, or had she been merely a courtesan? END
BEGIN NOW Was she expiating the flaunting triumphs of a youth overcrowded with pleasures by an old age in which she was shunned by every passer-by? END
BEGIN NOW Her vacant gaze sent a chill through you; her shriveled face seemed like a menace. END
BEGIN NOW Her voice was like the shrill, thin note of the grasshopper sounding from the thicket when winter is at hand. END
BEGIN NOW She said that she had nursed an old gentleman, ill of catarrh of the bladder, and left to die by his children, who thought that he had nothing left. END
BEGIN NOW His bequest to her, a life annuity of a thousand francs, was periodically disputed by his heirs, who mingled slander with their persecutions. END
BEGIN NOW In spite of the ravages of conflicting passions, her face retained some traces of its former fairness and fineness of tissue, some vestiges of the physical charms of her youth still survived. END
BEGIN NOW M. Poiret was a sort of automaton. END
BEGIN NOW He might be seen any day sailing like a gray shadow along the walks of the Jardin des Plantes, on his head a shabby cap, a cane with an old yellow ivory handle in the tips of his thin fingers; the outspread skirts of his threadbare overcoat failed to conceal his meagre figure; his breeches hung loosely on his shrunken limbs; the thin, blue-stockinged legs trembled like those of a drunken man; there was a notable breach of continuity between the dingy white waistcoat and crumpled shirt frills and the cravat twisted about a throat like a turkey gobbler's; altogether, his appearance set people wondering whether this outlandish ghost belonged to the audacious race of the sons of Japhet who flutter about on the Boulevard Italien. END
BEGIN NOW What devouring kind of toil could have so shriveled him? END
BEGIN NOW What devouring passions had darkened that bulbous countenance, which would have seemed outrageous as a caricature? END
BEGIN NOW What had he been? END
BEGIN NOW Well, perhaps he had been part of the machinery of justice, a clerk in the office to which the executioner sends in his accounts,&mdash;so much for providing black veils for parricides, so much for sawdust, so much for pulleys and cord for the knife. END
BEGIN NOW Or he might have been a receiver at the door of a public slaughter-house, or a sub-inspector of nuisances. END
BEGIN NOW Indeed, the man appeared to have been one of the beasts of burden in our great social mill; one of those Parisian Ratons whom their Bertrands do not even know by sight; a pivot in the obscure machinery that disposes of misery and things unclean; one of those men, in short, at sight of whom we are prompted to remark that, After all, we cannot do without them. END
BEGIN NOW Stately Paris ignores the existence of these faces bleached by moral or physical suffering; but, then, Paris is in truth an ocean that no line can plumb. END
BEGIN NOW You may survey its surface and describe it; but no matter how numerous and painstaking the toilers in this sea, there will always be lonely and unexplored regions in its depths, caverns unknown, flowers and pearls and monsters of the deep overlooked or forgotten by the divers of literature. END
BEGIN NOW The Maison Vauquer is one of these curious monstrosities. END
BEGIN NOW Two, however, of Vauquer's boarders formed a striking contrast to the rest. END
BEGIN NOW There was a sickly pallor, such as is often seen in anaemic girls, in Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Victorine Taillefer's face; and her unvarying expression of sadness, like her embarrassed manner and pinched look, was in keeping with the general wretchedness of the establishment in the Rue Nueve-Saint-Genevieve, which forms a background to this picture; but her face was young, there was youthfulness in her voice and elasticity in her movements. END
BEGIN NOW This young misfortune was not unlike a shrub, newly planted in an uncongenial soil, where its leaves have already begun to wither. END
BEGIN NOW The outlines of her figure, revealed by her dress of the simplest and cheapest materials, were also youthful. END
BEGIN NOW There was the same kind of charm about her too slender form, her faintly colored face and light-brown hair, that modern poets find in mediaeval statuettes; and a sweet expression, a look of Christian resignation in the dark gray eyes. END
BEGIN NOW She was pretty by force of contrast; if she had been happy, she would have been charming. END
BEGIN NOW Happiness is the poetry of woman, as the toilette is her tinsel. END
BEGIN NOW If the delightful excitement of a ball had made the pale face glow with color; if the delights of a luxurious life had brought the color to the wan cheeks that were slightly hollowed already; if love had put light into the sad eyes, then Victorine might have ranked among the fairest; but she lacked the two things which create woman a second time&mdash;pretty dresses and love-letters. END
BEGIN NOW A book might have been made of her story. END
BEGIN NOW Her father was persuaded that he had sufficient reason for declining to acknowledge her, and allowed her a bare six hundred francs a year; he had further taken measures to disinherit his daughter, and had converted all his real estate into personalty, that he might leave it undivided to his son. END
BEGIN NOW Victorine's mother had died broken-hearted in Couture's house; and the latter, who was a near relation, had taken charge of the little orphan. END
BEGIN NOW Unluckily, the widow of the commissary-general to the armies of the Republic had nothing in the world but her jointure and her widow's pension, and some day she might be obliged to leave the helpless, inexperienced girl to the mercy of the world. END
BEGIN NOW The good soul, therefore, took Victorine to mass every Sunday, and to confession once a fortnight, thinking that, in any case, she would bring up her ward to be devout. END
BEGIN NOW She was right; religion offered a solution of the problem of the young girl's future. END
BEGIN NOW The poor child loved the father who refused to acknowledge her. END
BEGIN NOW Once every year she tried to see him to deliver her mother's message of forgiveness, but every year hitherto she had knocked at that door in vain; her father was inexorable. END
BEGIN NOW Her brother, her only means of communication, had not come to see her for four years, and had sent her no assistance; yet she prayed to God to unseal her father's eyes and to soften her brother's heart, and no accusations mingled with her prayers. END
BEGIN NOW Couture and Vauquer exhausted the vocabulary of abuse, and failed to find words that did justice to the banker's iniquitous conduct; but while they heaped execrations on the millionaire, Victorine's words were as gentle as the moan of the wounded dove, and affection found expression even in the cry drawn from her by pain. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene de Rastignac was a thoroughly southern type; he had a fair complexion, blue eyes, black hair. END
BEGIN NOW In his figure, manner, and his whole bearing it was easy to see that he had either come of a noble family, or that, from his earliest childhood, he had been gently bred. END
BEGIN NOW If he was careful of his wardrobe, only taking last year's clothes into daily wear, still upon occasion he could issue forth as a young man of fashion. END
BEGIN NOW Ordinarily he wore a shabby coat and waistcoat, the limp black cravat, untidily knotted, that students affect, trousers that matched the rest of his costume, and boots that had been resoled. END
BEGIN NOW Vautrin (the man of forty with the dyed whiskers) marked a transition stage between these two young people and the others. END
BEGIN NOW He was the kind of man that calls forth the remark: He looks a jovial sort! END
BEGIN NOW He had broad shoulders, a well-developed chest, muscular arms, and strong square-fisted hands; the joints of his fingers were covered with tufts of fiery red hair. END
BEGIN NOW His face was furrowed by premature wrinkles; there was a certain hardness about it in spite of his bland and insinuating manner. END
BEGIN NOW His bass voice was by no means unpleasant, and was in keeping with his boisterous laughter. END
BEGIN NOW He was always obliging, always in good spirits; if anything went wrong with one of the locks, he would soon unscrew it, take it to pieces, file it, oil and clean and set it in order, and put it back in its place again; I am an old hand at it, he used to say. END
BEGIN NOW Not only so, he knew all about ships, the sea, France, foreign countries, men, business, law, great houses and prisons,&mdash;there was nothing that he did not know. END
BEGIN NOW If any one complained rather more than usual, he would offer his services at once. END
BEGIN NOW He had several times lent money to Vauquer, or to the boarders; but, somehow, those whom he obliged felt that they would sooner face death than fail to repay him; a certain resolute look, sometimes seen on his face, inspired fear of him, for all his appearance of easy good-nature. END
BEGIN NOW In the way he spat there was an imperturbable coolness which seemed to indicate that this was a man who would not stick at a crime to extricate himself from a false position. END
BEGIN NOW His eyes, like those of a pitiless judge, seemed to go to the very bottom of all questions, to read all natures, all feelings and thoughts. END
BEGIN NOW His habit of life was very regular; he usually went out after breakfast, returning in time for dinner, and disappeared for the rest of the evening, letting himself in about midnight with a latch key, a privilege that Vauquer accorded to no other boarder. END
BEGIN NOW But then he was on very good terms with the widow; he used to call her mamma, and put his arm round her waist, a piece of flattery perhaps not appreciated to the full! END
BEGIN NOW The worthy woman might imagine this to be an easy feat; but, as a matter of fact, no arm but Vautrin's was long enough to encircle her. END
BEGIN NOW It was a characteristic trait of his generously to pay fifteen francs a month for the cup of coffee with a dash of brandy in it, which he took after dinner. END
BEGIN NOW Less superficial observers than young men engulfed by the whirlpool of Parisian life, or old men, who took no interest in anything that did not directly concern them, would not have stopped short at the vaguely unsatisfactory impression that Vautrin made upon them. END
BEGIN NOW He knew or guessed the concerns of every one about him; but none of them had been able to penetrate his thoughts, or to discover his occupation. END
BEGIN NOW He had deliberately made his apparent good-nature, his unfailing readiness to oblige, and his high spirits into a barrier between himself and the rest of them, but not seldom he gave glimpses of appalling depths of character. END
BEGIN NOW He seemed to delight in scourging the upper classes of society with the lash of his tongue, to take pleasure in convicting it of inconsistency, in mocking at law and order with some grim jest worthy of Juvenal, as if some grudge against the social system rankled in him, as if there were some mystery carefully hidden away in his life. END
BEGIN NOW Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Taillefer felt attracted, perhaps unconsciously, by the strength of the one man, and the good looks of the other; her stolen glances and secret thoughts were divided between them; but neither of them seemed to take any notice of her, although some day a chance might alter her position, and she would be a wealthy heiress. END
BEGIN NOW For that matter, there was not a soul in the house who took any trouble to investigate the various chronicles of misfortunes, real or imaginary, related by the rest. END
BEGIN NOW Each one regarded the others with indifference, tempered by suspicion; it was a natural result of their relative positions. END
BEGIN NOW Practical assistance not one could give, this they all knew, and they had long since exhausted their stock of condolence over previous discussions of their grievances. END
BEGIN NOW They were in something the same position as an elderly couple who have nothing left to say to each other. END
BEGIN NOW The routine of existence kept them in contact, but they were parts of a mechanism which wanted oil. END
BEGIN NOW There was not one of them but would have passed a blind man begging in the street, not one that felt moved to pity by a tale of misfortune, not one who did not see in death the solution of the all-absorbing problem of misery which left them cold to the most terrible anguish in others. END
BEGIN NOW The happiest of these hapless beings was certainly Vauquer, who reigned supreme over this hospital supported by voluntary contributions. END
BEGIN NOW For her, the little garden, which silence, and cold, and rain, and drought combined to make as dreary as an Asian _steppe_, was a pleasant shaded nook; the gaunt yellow house, the musty odors of a back shop had charms for her, and for her alone. END
BEGIN NOW Those cells belonged to her. END
BEGIN NOW She fed those convicts condemned to penal servitude for life, and her authority was recognized among them. END
BEGIN NOW Where else in Paris would they have found wholesome food in sufficient quantity at the prices she charged them, and rooms which they were at liberty to make, if not exactly elegant or comfortable, at any rate clean and healthy? END
BEGIN NOW If she had committed some flagrant act of injustice, the victim would have borne it in silence. END
BEGIN NOW Such a gathering contained, as might have been expected, the elements out of which a complete society might be constructed. END
BEGIN NOW And, as in a school, as in the world itself, there was among the eighteen men and women who met round the dinner table a poor creature, despised by all the others, condemned to be the butt of all their jokes. END
BEGIN NOW At the beginning of Eugene de Rastignac's second twelvemonth, this figure suddenly started out into bold relief against the background of human forms and faces among which the law student was yet to live for another two years to come. END
BEGIN NOW This laughing-stock was the retired vermicelli-merchant, Father Goriot, upon whose face a painter, like the historian, would have concentrated all the light in his picture. END
BEGIN NOW How had it come about that the boarders regarded him with a half-malignant contempt? END
BEGIN NOW Why did they subject the oldest among their number to a kind of persecution, in which there was mingled some pity, but no respect for his misfortunes? END
BEGIN NOW Had he brought it on himself by some eccentricity or absurdity, which is less easily forgiven or forgotten than more serious defects? END
BEGIN NOW The question strikes at the root of many a social injustice. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps it is only human nature to inflict suffering on anything that will endure suffering, whether by reason of its genuine humility, or indifference, or sheer helplessness. END
BEGIN NOW Do we not, one and all, like to feel our strength even at the expense of some one or of something? END
BEGIN NOW The poorest sample of humanity, the street arab, will pull the bell handle at every street door in bitter weather, and scramble up to write his name on the unsullied marble of a monument. END
BEGIN NOW In the year , at the age of sixty-nine or thereabouts, Father Goriot had sold his business and retired&mdash;to Vauquer's boarding house. END
BEGIN NOW When he first came there he had taken the rooms now occupied by Couture; he had paid twelve hundred francs a year like a man to whom five louis more or less was a mere trifle. END
BEGIN NOW For him Vauquer had made various improvements in the three rooms destined for his use, in consideration of a certain sum paid in advance, so it was said, for the miserable furniture, that is to say, for some yellow cotton curtains, a few chairs of stained wood covered with Utrecht velvet, several wretched colored prints in frames, and wall papers that a little suburban tavern would have disdained. END
BEGIN NOW Possibly it was the careless generosity with which Father Goriot allowed himself to be overreached at this period of his life (they called him Monsieur Goriot very respectfully then) that gave Vauquer the meanest opinion of his business abilities; she looked on him as an imbecile where money was concerned. END
BEGIN NOW Goriot had brought with him a considerable wardrobe, the gorgeous outfit of a retired tradesman who denies himself nothing. END
BEGIN NOW Vauquer's astonished eyes beheld no less than eighteen cambric-fronted shirts, the splendor of their fineness being enhanced by a pair of pins each bearing a large diamond, and connected by a short chain, an ornament which adorned the vermicelli-maker's shirt front. END
BEGIN NOW He usually wore a coat of corn-flower blue; his rotund and portly person was still further set off by a clean white waistcoat, and a gold chain and seals which dangled over that broad expanse. END
BEGIN NOW When his hostess accused him of being a bit of a beau, he smiled with the vanity of a citizen whose foible is gratified. END
BEGIN NOW His cupboards (_ormoires_, as he called them in the popular dialect) were filled with a quantity of plate that he brought with him. END
BEGIN NOW The widow's eyes gleamed as she obligingly helped him to unpack the soup ladles, table-spoons, forks, cruet-stands, tureens, dishes, and breakfast services&mdash;all of silver, which were duly arranged upon shelves, besides a few more or less handsome pieces of plate, all weighing no inconsiderable number of ounces; he could not bring himself to part with these gifts that reminded him of past domestic festivals. END
BEGIN NOW This was my wife's present to me on the first anniversary of our wedding day, he said to Vauquer, as he put away a little silver posset dish, with two turtle-doves billing on the cover. END
BEGIN NOW Poor dear! END
BEGIN NOW she spent on it all the money she had saved before we were married. END
BEGIN NOW Do you know, I would sooner scratch the earth with my nails for a living, madame, than part with that. END
BEGIN NOW But I shall be able to take my coffee out of it every morning for the rest of my days, thank the Lord! END
BEGIN NOW I am not to be pitied. END
BEGIN NOW There's not much fear of my starving for some time to come. END
BEGIN NOW Finally, Vauquer's magpie's eye had discovered and read certain entries in the list of shareholders in the funds, and, after a rough calculation, was disposed to credit Goriot (worthy man) with something like ten thousand francs a year. END
BEGIN NOW From that day forward Vauquer (_nee_ de Conflans), who, as a matter of fact, had seen forty-eight summers, though she would only own to thirty-nine of them&mdash; Vauquer had her own ideas. END
BEGIN NOW Though Goriot's eyes seemed to have shrunk in their sockets, though they were weak and watery, owing to some glandular affection which compelled him to wipe them continually, she considered him to be a very gentlemanly and pleasant-looking man. END
BEGIN NOW Moreover, the widow saw favorable indications of character in the well-developed calves of his legs and in his square-shaped nose, indications still further borne out by the worthy man's full-moon countenance and look of stupid good-nature. END
BEGIN NOW This, in all probability, was a strongly-build animal, whose brains mostly consisted in a capacity for affection. END
BEGIN NOW His hair, worn in _ailes de pigeon_, and duly powdered every morning by the barber from the Ecole Polytechnique, described five points on his low forehead, and made an elegant setting to his face. END
BEGIN NOW Though his manners were somewhat boorish, he was always as neat as a new pin and he took his snuff in a lordly way, like a man who knows that his snuff-box is always likely to be filled with maccaboy, so that when Vauquer lay down to rest on the day of M. Goriot's installation, her heart, like a larded partridge, sweltered before the fire of a burning desire to shake off the shroud of Vauquer and rise again as Goriot. END
BEGIN NOW She would marry again, sell her boarding-house, give her hand to this fine flower of citizenship, become a lady of consequence in the quarter, and ask for subscriptions for charitable purposes; she would make little Sunday excursions to Choisy, Soissy, Gentilly; she would have a box at the theatre when she liked, instead of waiting for the author's tickets that one of her boarders sometimes gave her, in July; the whole Eldorado of a little Parisian household rose up before Vauquer in her dreams. END
BEGIN NOW Nobody knew that she herself possessed forty thousand francs, accumulated _sou by sou_, that was her secret; surely as far as money was concerned she was a very tolerable match. END
BEGIN NOW And in other respects, I am quite his equal, she said to herself, turning as if to assure herself of the charms of a form that the portly Sylvie found moulded in down feathers every morning. END
BEGIN NOW For three months from that day Veuve Vauquer availed herself of the services of M. Goriot's coiffeur, and went to some expense over her toilette, expense justifiable on the ground that she owed it to herself and her establishment to pay some attention to appearances when such highly-respectable persons honored her house with their presence. END
BEGIN NOW She expended no small amount of ingenuity in a sort of weeding process of her lodgers, announcing her intention of receiving henceforward none but people who were in every way select. END
BEGIN NOW If a stranger presented himself, she let him know that M. Goriot, one of the best known and most highly-respected merchants in Paris, had singled out her boarding-house for a residence. END
BEGIN NOW She drew up a prospectus headed MAISON VAUQUER, in which it was asserted that hers was _one of the oldest and most highly recommended boarding-houses in the Latin Quarter_. END
BEGIN NOW From the windows of the house, thus ran the prospectus, there is a charming view of the Vallee des Gobelins (so there is&mdash;from the third floor), and a _beautiful_ garden, _extending_ down to _an avenue of lindens_ at the further end. END
BEGIN NOW Mention was made of the bracing air of the place and its quiet situation. END
BEGIN NOW It was this prospectus that attracted la Comtesse de l'Ambermesnil, a widow of six and thirty, who was awaiting the final settlement of her husband's affairs, and of another matter regarding a pension due to her as the wife of a general who had died on the field of battle. END
BEGIN NOW On this Vauquer saw to her table, lighted a fire daily in the sitting-room for nearly six months, and kept the promise of her prospectus, even going to some expense to do so. END
BEGIN NOW And the Countess, on her side, addressed Vauquer as my dear, and promised her two more boarders, the Baronne de Vaumerland and the widow of a colonel, the late Comte de Picquoisie, who were about to leave a boarding-house in the Marais, where the terms were higher than at the Maison Vauquer. END
BEGIN NOW Both these ladies, moreover, would be very well to do when the people at the War Office had come to an end of their formalities. END
BEGIN NOW But Government departments are always so dilatory, the lady added. END
BEGIN NOW After dinner the two widows went together up to Vauquer's room, and had a snug little chat over some cordial and various delicacies reserved for the mistress of the house. END
BEGIN NOW Vauquer's ideas as to Goriot were cordially approved by de l'Ambermesnil; it was a capital notion, which for that matter she had guessed from the very first; in her opinion the vermicelli maker was an excellent man. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW my dear lady, such a well-preserved man of his age, as sound as my eyesight&mdash;a man who might make a woman happy! END
BEGIN NOW said the widow. END
BEGIN NOW The good-natured Countess turned to the subject of Vauquer's dress, which was not in harmony with her projects. END
BEGIN NOW You must put yourself on a war footing, said she. END
BEGIN NOW After much serious consideration the two widows went shopping together&mdash;they purchased a hat adorned with ostrich feathers and a cap at the Palais Royal, and the Countess took her friend to the Magasin de la Petite Jeannette, where they chose a dress and a scarf. END
BEGIN NOW Thus equipped for the campaign, the widow looked exactly like the prize animal hung out for a sign above an a la mode beef shop; but she herself was so much pleased with the improvement, as she considered it, in her appearance, that she felt that she lay under some obligation to the Countess; and, though by no means open-handed, she begged that lady to accept a hat that cost twenty francs. END
BEGIN NOW The fact was that she needed the Countess' services on the delicate mission of sounding Goriot; the countess must sing her praises in his ears. END
BEGIN NOW de l'Ambermesnil lent herself very good-naturedly to this manoeuvre, began her operations, and succeeded in obtaining a private interview; but the overtures that she made, with a view to securing him for herself, were received with embarrassment, not to say a repulse. END
BEGIN NOW She left him, revolted by his coarseness. END
BEGIN NOW My angel, said she to her dear friend, you will make nothing of that man yonder. END
BEGIN NOW He is absurdly suspicious, and he is a mean curmudgeon, an idiot, a fool; you would never be happy with him. END
BEGIN NOW After what had passed between M. Goriot and de l'Ambermesnil, the Countess would no longer live under the same roof. END
BEGIN NOW She left the next day, forgot to pay for six months' board, and left behind her wardrobe, cast-off clothing to the value of five francs. END
BEGIN NOW Eagerly and persistently as Vauquer sought her quondam lodger, the Comtesse de l'Ambermesnil was never heard of again in Paris. END
BEGIN NOW The widow often talked of this deplorable business, and regretted her own too confiding disposition. END
BEGIN NOW As a matter of fact, she was as suspicious as a cat; but she was like many other people, who cannot trust their own kin and put themselves at the mercy of the next chance comer&mdash;an odd but common phenomenon, whose causes may readily be traced to the depths of the human heart. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps there are people who know that they have nothing more to look for from those with whom they live; they have shown the emptiness of their hearts to their housemates, and in their secret selves they are conscious that they are severely judged, and that they deserve to be judged severely; but still they feel an unconquerable craving for praises that they do not hear, or they are consumed by a desire to appear to possess, in the eyes of a new audience, the qualities which they have not, hoping to win the admiration or affection of strangers at the risk of forfeiting it again some day. END
BEGIN NOW Or, once more, there are other mercenary natures who never do a kindness to a friend or a relation simply because these have a claim upon them, while a service done to a stranger brings its reward to self-love. END
BEGIN NOW Such natures feel but little affection for those who are nearest to them; they keep their kindness for remoter circles of acquaintance, and show most to those who dwell on its utmost limits. END
BEGIN NOW Vauquer belonged to both these essentially mean, false, and execrable classes. END
BEGIN NOW If I had been there at the time, Vautrin would say at the end of the story, I would have shown her up, and that misfortune would not have befallen you. END
BEGIN NOW I know that kind of phiz! END
BEGIN NOW Like all narrow natures, Vauquer was wont to confine her attention to events, and did not go very deeply into the causes that brought them about; she likewise preferred to throw the blame of her own mistakes on other people, so she chose to consider that the honest vermicelli maker was responsible for her misfortune. END
BEGIN NOW It had opened her eyes, so she said, with regard to him. END
BEGIN NOW As soon as she saw that her blandishments were in vain, and that her outlay on her toilette was money thrown away, she was not slow to discover the reason of his indifference. END
BEGIN NOW It became plain to her at once that there was _some other attraction_, to use her own expression. END
BEGIN NOW In short, it was evident that the hope she had so fondly cherished was a baseless delusion, and that she would never make anything out of that man yonder, in the Countess' forcible phrase. END
BEGIN NOW The Countess seemed to have been a judge of character. END
BEGIN NOW Vauquer's aversion was naturally more energetic than her friendship, for her hatred was not in proportion to her love, but to her disappointed expectations. END
BEGIN NOW The human heart may find here and there a resting-place short of the highest height of affection, but we seldom stop in the steep, downward slope of hatred. END
BEGIN NOW Still, M. Goriot was a lodger, and the widow's wounded self-love could not vent itself in an explosion of wrath; like a monk harassed by the prior of his convent, she was forced to stifle her sighs of disappointment, and to gulp down her craving for revenge. END
BEGIN NOW Little minds find gratification for their feelings, benevolent or otherwise, by a constant exercise of petty ingenuity. END
BEGIN NOW The widow employed her woman's malice to devise a system of covert persecution. END
BEGIN NOW She began by a course of retrenchment&mdash;various luxuries which had found their way to the table appeared there no more. END
BEGIN NOW No more gherkins, no more anchovies; they have made a fool of me! END
BEGIN NOW she said to Sylvie one morning, and they returned to the old bill of fare. END
BEGIN NOW The thrifty frugality necessary to those who mean to make their way in the world had become an inveterate habit of life with M. Goriot. END
BEGIN NOW Soup, boiled beef, and a dish of vegetables had been, and always would be, the dinner he liked best, so Vauquer found it very difficult to annoy a boarder whose tastes were so simple. END
BEGIN NOW He was proof against her malice, and in desperation she spoke to him and of him slightingly before the other lodgers, who began to amuse themselves at his expense, and so gratified her desire for revenge. END
BEGIN NOW Towards the end of the first year the widow's suspicions had reached such a pitch that she began to wonder how it was that a retired merchant with a secure income of seven or eight thousand livres, the owner of such magnificent plate and jewelry handsome enough for a kept mistress, should be living in her house. END
BEGIN NOW Why should he devote so small a proportion of his money to his expenses? END
BEGIN NOW Until the first year was nearly at an end, Goriot had dined out once or twice every week, but these occasions came less frequently, and at last he was scarcely absent from the dinner-table twice a month. END
BEGIN NOW It was hardly expected that Vauquer should regard the increased regularity of her boarder's habits with complacency, when those little excursions of his had been so much to her interest. END
BEGIN NOW She attributed the change not so much to a gradual diminution of fortune as to a spiteful wish to annoy his hostess. END
BEGIN NOW It is one of the most detestable habits of a Liliputian mind to credit other people with its own malignant pettiness. END
BEGIN NOW Unluckily, towards the end of the second year, M. Goriot's conduct gave some color to the idle talk about him. END
BEGIN NOW He asked Vauquer to give him a room on the second floor, and to make a corresponding reduction in her charges. END
BEGIN NOW Apparently, such strict economy was called for, that he did without a fire all through the winter. END
BEGIN NOW Vauquer asked to be paid in advance, an arrangement to which M. Goriot consented, and thenceforward she spoke of him as Father Goriot. END
BEGIN NOW What had brought about this decline and fall? END
BEGIN NOW Conjecture was keen, but investigation was difficult. END
BEGIN NOW Father Goriot was not communicative; in the sham countess' phrase he was a curmudgeon. END
BEGIN NOW Empty-headed people who babble about their own affairs because they have nothing else to occupy them, naturally conclude that if people say nothing of their doings it is because their doings will not bear being talked about; so the highly respectable merchant became a scoundrel, and the late beau was an old rogue. END
BEGIN NOW Opinion fluctuated. END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes, according to Vautrin, who came about this time to live in the Maison Vauquer, Father Goriot was a man who went on 'Change and _dabbled_ (to use the sufficiently expressive language of the Stock Exchange) in stocks and shares after he had ruined himself by heavy speculation. END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes it was held that he was one of those petty gamblers who nightly play for small stakes until they win a few francs. END
BEGIN NOW A theory that he was a detective in the employ of the Home Office found favor at one time, but Vautrin urged that Goriot was not sharp enough for one of that sort. END
BEGIN NOW There were yet other solutions; Father Goriot was a skinflint, a shark of a money-lender, a man who lived by selling lottery tickets. END
BEGIN NOW He was by turns all the most mysterious brood of vice and shame and misery; yet, however vile his life might be, the feeling of repulsion which he aroused in others was not so strong that he must be banished from their society&mdash;he paid his way. END
BEGIN NOW Besides, Goriot had his uses, every one vented his spleen or sharpened his wit on him; he was pelted with jokes and belabored with hard words. END
BEGIN NOW The general consensus of opinion was in favor of a theory which seemed the most likely; this was Vauquer's view. END
BEGIN NOW According to her, the man so well preserved at his time of life, as sound as her eyesight, with whom a woman might be very happy, was a libertine who had strange tastes. END
BEGIN NOW These are the facts upon which Vauquer's slanders were based. END
BEGIN NOW Early one morning, some few months after the departure of the unlucky Countess who had managed to live for six months at the widow's expense, Vauquer (not yet dressed) heard the rustle of a silk dress and a young woman's light footstep on the stair; some one was going to Goriot's room. END
BEGIN NOW He seemed to expect the visit, for his door stood ajar. END
BEGIN NOW The portly Sylvie presently came up to tell her mistress that a girl too pretty to be honest, dressed like a goddess, and not a speck of mud on her laced cashmere boots, had glided in from the street like a snake, had found the kitchen, and asked for M. Goriot's room. END
BEGIN NOW Vauquer and the cook, listening, overheard several words affectionately spoken during the visit, which lasted for some time. END
BEGIN NOW When M. Goriot went downstairs with the lady, the stout Sylvie forthwith took her basket and followed the lover-like couple, under pretext of going to do her marketing. END
BEGIN NOW M. Goriot must be awfully rich, all the same, madame, she reported on her return, to keep her in such style. END
BEGIN NOW Just imagine it! END
BEGIN NOW There was a splendid carriage waiting at the corner of the Place de l'Estrapade, and _she_ got into it. END
BEGIN NOW While they were at dinner that evening, Vauquer went to the window and drew the curtain, as the sun was shining into Goriot's eyes. END
BEGIN NOW You are beloved of fair ladies, M. Goriot&mdash;the sun seeks you out, she said, alluding to his visitor. END
BEGIN NOW _Peste!_ you have good taste; she was very pretty. END
BEGIN NOW That was my daughter, he said, with a kind of pride in his voice, and the rest chose to consider this as the fatuity of an old man who wishes to save appearances. END
BEGIN NOW A month after this visit M. Goriot received another. END
BEGIN NOW The same daughter who had come to see him that morning came again after dinner, this time in evening dress. END
BEGIN NOW The boarders, in deep discussion in the dining-room, caught a glimpse of a lovely, fair-haired woman, slender, graceful, and much too distinguished-looking to be a daughter of Father Goriot's. END
BEGIN NOW Two of them! END
BEGIN NOW cried the portly Sylvie, who did not recognize the lady of the first visit. END
BEGIN NOW A few days later, and another young lady&mdash;a tall, well-moulded brunette, with dark hair and bright eyes&mdash;came to ask for M. Goriot. END
BEGIN NOW Three of them! END
BEGIN NOW said Sylvie. END
BEGIN NOW Then the second daughter, who had first come in the morning to see her father, came shortly afterwards in the evening. END
BEGIN NOW She wore a ball dress, and came in a carriage. END
BEGIN NOW Four of them! END
BEGIN NOW commented Vauquer and her plump handmaid. END
BEGIN NOW Sylvie saw not a trace of resemblance between this great lady and the girl in her simple morning dress who had entered her kitchen on the occasion of her first visit. END
BEGIN NOW At that time Goriot was paying twelve hundred francs a year to his landlady, and Vauquer saw nothing out of the common in the fact that a rich man had four or five mistresses; nay, she thought it very knowing of him to pass them off as his daughters. END
BEGIN NOW She was not at all inclined to draw a hard-and-fast line, or to take umbrage at his sending for them to the Maison Vauquer; yet, inasmuch as these visits explained her boarder's indifference to her, she went so far (at the end of the second year) as to speak of him as an ugly old wretch. END
BEGIN NOW When at length her boarder declined to nine hundred francs a year, she asked him very insolently what he took her house to be, after meeting one of these ladies on the stairs. END
BEGIN NOW Father Goriot answered that the lady was his eldest daughter. END
BEGIN NOW So you have two or three dozen daughters, have you? END
BEGIN NOW said Vauquer sharply. END
BEGIN NOW I have only two, her boarder answered meekly, like a ruined man who is broken in to all the cruel usage of misfortune. END
BEGIN NOW Towards the end of the third year Father Goriot reduced his expenses still further; he went up to the third story, and now paid forty-five francs a month. END
BEGIN NOW He did without snuff, told his hairdresser that he no longer required his services, and gave up wearing powder. END
BEGIN NOW When Goriot appeared for the first time in this condition, an exclamation of astonishment broke from his hostess at the color of his hair&mdash;a dingy olive gray. END
BEGIN NOW He had grown sadder day by day under the influence of some hidden trouble; among all the faces round the table, his was the most woe-begone. END
BEGIN NOW There was no longer any doubt. END
BEGIN NOW Goriot was an elderly libertine, whose eyes had only been preserved by the skill of the physician from the malign influence of the remedies necessitated by the state of his health. END
BEGIN NOW The disgusting color of his hair was a result of his excesses and of the drugs which he had taken that he might continue his career. END
BEGIN NOW The poor old man's mental and physical condition afforded some grounds for the absurd rubbish talked about him. END
BEGIN NOW When his outfit was worn out, he replaced the fine linen by calico at fourteen _sous_ the ell. END
BEGIN NOW His diamonds, his gold snuff-box, watch-chain and trinkets, disappeared one by one. END
BEGIN NOW He had left off wearing the corn-flower blue coat, and was sumptuously arrayed, summer as well as winter, in a coarse chestnut-brown coat, a plush waistcoat, and doeskin breeches. END
BEGIN NOW He grew thinner and thinner; his legs were shrunken, his cheeks, once so puffed out by contented bourgeois prosperity, were covered with wrinkles, and the outlines of the jawbones were distinctly visible; there were deep furrows in his forehead. END
BEGIN NOW In the fourth year of his residence in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve he was no longer like his former self. END
BEGIN NOW The hale vermicelli manufacturer, sixty-two years of age, who had looked scarce forty, the stout, comfortable, prosperous tradesman, with an almost bucolic air, and such a brisk demeanor that it did you good to look at him; the man with something boyish in his smile, had suddenly sunk into his dotage, and had become a feeble, vacillating septuagenarian. END
BEGIN NOW The keen, bright blue eyes had grown dull, and faded to a steel-gray color; the red inflamed rims looked as though they had shed tears of blood. END
BEGIN NOW He excited feelings of repulsion in some, and of pity in others. END
BEGIN NOW The young medical students who came to the house noticed the drooping of his lower lip and the conformation of the facial angle; and, after teasing him for some time to no purpose, they declared that cretinism was setting in. END
BEGIN NOW One evening after dinner Vauquer said half banteringly to him, So those daughters of yours don't come to see you any more, eh? END
BEGIN NOW meaning to imply her doubts as to his paternity; but Father Goriot shrank as if his hostess had touched him with a sword-point. END
BEGIN NOW They come sometimes, he said in a tremulous voice. END
BEGIN NOW Aha! END
BEGIN NOW you still see them sometimes? END
BEGIN NOW cried the students. END
BEGIN NOW Bravo, Father Goriot! END
BEGIN NOW The old man scarcely seemed to hear the witticisms at his expense that followed on the words; he had relapsed into the dreamy state of mind that these superficial observers took for senile torpor, due to his lack of intelligence. END
BEGIN NOW If they had only known, they might have been deeply interested by the problem of his condition; but few problems were more obscure. END
BEGIN NOW It was easy, of course, to find out whether Goriot had really been a vermicelli manufacturer; the amount of his fortune was readily discoverable; but the old people, who were most inquisitive as to his concerns, never went beyond the limits of the Quarter, and lived in the lodging-house much as oysters cling to a rock. END
BEGIN NOW As for the rest, the current of life in Paris daily awaited them, and swept them away with it; so soon as they left the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve, they forgot the existence of the old man, their butt at dinner. END
BEGIN NOW For those narrow souls, or for careless youth, the misery in Father Goriot's withered face and its dull apathy were quite incompatible with wealth or any sort of intelligence. END
BEGIN NOW As for the creatures whom he called his daughters, all Vauquer's boarders were of her opinion. END
BEGIN NOW With the faculty for severe logic sedulously cultivated by elderly women during long evenings of gossip till they can always find an hypothesis to fit all circumstances, she was wont to reason thus: If Father Goriot had daughters of his own as rich as those ladies who came here seemed to be, he would not be lodging in my house, on the third floor, at forty-five francs a month; and he would not go about dressed like a poor man. END
BEGIN NOW No objection could be raised to these inferences. END
BEGIN NOW So by the end of the month of November , at the time when the curtain rises on this drama, every one in the house had come to have a very decided opinion as to the poor old man. END
BEGIN NOW He had never had either wife or daughter; excesses had reduced him to this sluggish condition; he was a sort of human mollusk who should be classed among the capulidoe, so one of the dinner contingent, an _employe_ at the Museum, who had a pretty wit of his own. END
BEGIN NOW Poiret was an eagle, a gentleman, compared with Goriot. END
BEGIN NOW Poiret would join the talk, argue, answer when he was spoken to; as a matter of fact, his talk, arguments, and responses contributed nothing to the conversation, for Poiret had a habit of repeating what the others said in different words; still, he did join in the talk; he was alive, and seemed capable of feeling; while Father Goriot (to quote the Museum official again) was invariably at zero degrees&mdash;Reaumur. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene de Rastignac had just returned to Paris in a state of mind not unknown to young men who are conscious of unusual powers, and to those whose faculties are so stimulated by a difficult position, that for the time being they rise above the ordinary level. END
BEGIN NOW Rastignac's first year of study for the preliminary examinations in law had left him free to see the sights of Paris and to enjoy some of its amusements. END
BEGIN NOW A student has not much time on his hands if he sets himself to learn the repertory of every theatre, and to study the ins and outs of the labyrinth of Paris. END
BEGIN NOW To know its customs; to learn the language, and become familiar with the amusements of the capital, he must explore its recesses, good and bad, follow the studies that please him best, and form some idea of the treasures contained in galleries and museums. END
BEGIN NOW At this stage of his career a student grows eager and excited about all sorts of follies that seem to him to be of immense importance. END
BEGIN NOW He has his hero, his great man, a professor at the College de France, paid to talk down to the level of his audience. END
BEGIN NOW He adjusts his cravat, and strikes various attitudes for the benefit of the women in the first galleries at the Opera-Comique. END
BEGIN NOW As he passes through all these successive initiations, and breaks out of his sheath, the horizons of life widen around him, and at length he grasps the plan of society with the different human strata of which it is composed. END
BEGIN NOW If he begins by admiring the procession of carriages on sunny afternoons in the Champs-Elysees, he soon reaches the further stage of envying their owners. END
BEGIN NOW Unconsciously, Eugene had served his apprenticeship before he went back to Angouleme for the long vacation after taking his degrees as bachelor of arts and bachelor of law. END
BEGIN NOW The illusions of childhood had vanished, so also had the ideas he brought with him from the provinces; he had returned thither with an intelligence developed, with loftier ambitions, and saw things as they were at home in the old manor house. END
BEGIN NOW His father and mother, his two brothers and two sisters, with an aged aunt, whose whole fortune consisted in annuities, lived on the little estate of Rastignac. END
BEGIN NOW The whole property brought in about three thousand francs; and though the amount varied with the season (as must always be the case in a vine-growing district), they were obliged to spare an unvarying twelve hundred francs out of their income for him. END
BEGIN NOW He saw how constantly the poverty, which they had generously hidden from him, weighed upon them; he could not help comparing the sisters, who had seemed so beautiful to his boyish eyes, with women in Paris, who had realized the beauty of his dreams. END
BEGIN NOW The uncertain future of the whole family depended upon him. END
BEGIN NOW It did not escape his eyes that not a crumb was wasted in the house, nor that the wine they drank was made from the second pressing; a multitude of small things, which it is useless to speak of in detail here, made him burn to distinguish himself, and his ambition to succeed increased tenfold. END
BEGIN NOW He meant, like all great souls, that his success should be owing entirely to his merits; but his was pre-eminently a southern temperament, the execution of his plans was sure to be marred by the vertigo that seizes on youth when youth sees itself alone in a wide sea, uncertain how to spend its energies, whither to steer its course, how to adapt its sails to the winds. END
BEGIN NOW At first he determined to fling himself heart and soul into his work, but he was diverted from this purpose by the need of society and connections; then he saw how great an influence women exert in social life, and suddenly made up his mind to go out into this world to seek a protectress there. END
BEGIN NOW Surely a clever and high-spirited young man, whose wit and courage were set off to advantage by a graceful figure and the vigorous kind of beauty that readily strikes a woman's imagination, need not despair of finding a protectress. END
BEGIN NOW These ideas occurred to him in his country walks with his sisters, whom he had once joined so gaily. END
BEGIN NOW The girls thought him very much changed. END
BEGIN NOW His aunt, de Marcillac, had been presented at court, and had moved among the brightest heights of that lofty region. END
BEGIN NOW Suddenly the young man's ambition discerned in those recollections of hers, which had been like nursery fairy tales to her nephews and nieces, the elements of a social success at least as important as the success which he had achieved at the Ecole de Droit. END
BEGIN NOW He began to ask his aunt about those relations; some of the old ties might still hold good. END
BEGIN NOW After much shaking of the branches of the family tree, the old lady came to the conclusion that of all persons who could be useful to her nephew among the selfish genus of rich relations, the Vicomtesse de Beauseant was the least likely to refuse. END
BEGIN NOW To this lady, therefore, she wrote in the old-fashioned style, recommending Eugene to her; pointing out to her nephew that if he succeeded in pleasing de Beauseant, the Vicomtesse would introduce him to other relations. END
BEGIN NOW A few days after his return to Paris, therefore, Rastignac sent his aunt's letter to de Beauseant. END
BEGIN NOW The Vicomtesse replied by an invitation to a ball for the following evening. END
BEGIN NOW This was the position of affairs at the Maison Vauquer at the end of November A few days later, after de Beauseant's ball, Eugene came in at two o'clock in the morning. END
BEGIN NOW The persevering student meant to make up for the lost time by working until daylight. END
BEGIN NOW It was the first time that he had attempted to spend the night in this way in that silent quarter. END
BEGIN NOW The spell of a factitious energy was upon him; he had beheld the pomp and splendor of the world. END
BEGIN NOW He had not dined at the Maison Vauquer; the boarders probably would think that he would walk home at daybreak from the dance, as he had done sometimes on former occasions, after a fete at the Prado, or a ball at the Odeon, splashing his silk stockings thereby, and ruining his pumps. END
BEGIN NOW It so happened that Christophe took a look into the street before drawing the bolts of the door; and Rastignac, coming in at that moment, could go up to his room without making any noise, followed by Christophe, who made a great deal. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene exchanged his dress suit for a shabby overcoat and slippers, kindled a fire with some blocks of patent fuel, and prepared for his night's work in such a sort that the faint sounds he made were drowned by Christophe's heavy tramp on the stairs. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene sat absorbed in thought for a few moments before plunging into his law books. END
BEGIN NOW He had just become aware of the fact that the Vicomtesse de Beauseant was one of the queens of fashion, that her house was thought to be the pleasantest in the Faubourg Saint-Germain. END
BEGIN NOW And not only so, she was, by right of her fortune, and the name she bore, one of the most conspicuous figures in that aristocratic world. END
BEGIN NOW Thanks to the aunt, thanks to de Marcillac's letter of introduction, the poor student had been kindly received in that house before he knew the extent of the favor thus shown to him. END
BEGIN NOW It was almost like a patent of nobility to be admitted to those gilded salons; he had appeared in the most exclusive circle in Paris, and now all doors were open for him. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene had been dazzled at first by the brilliant assembly, and had scarcely exchanged a few words with the Vicomtesse; he had been content to single out a goddess among this throng of Parisian divinities, one of those women who are sure to attract a young man's fancy. END
BEGIN NOW The Comtesse Anastasie de Restaud was tall and gracefully made; she had one of the prettiest figures in Paris. END
BEGIN NOW Imagine a pair of great dark eyes, a magnificently moulded hand, a shapely foot. END
BEGIN NOW There was a fiery energy in her movements; the Marquis de Ronquerolles had called her a thoroughbred, a pure pedigree, these figures of speech have replaced the heavenly angel and Ossianic nomenclature; the old mythology of love is extinct, doomed to perish by modern dandyism. END
BEGIN NOW But for Rastignac, Anastasie de Restaud was the woman for whom he had sighed. END
BEGIN NOW He had contrived to write his name twice upon the list of partners upon her fan, and had snatched a few words with her during the first quadrille. END
BEGIN NOW Where shall I meet you again, Madame? END
BEGIN NOW he asked abruptly, and the tones of his voice were full of the vehement energy that women like so well. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, everywhere! END
BEGIN NOW said she, in the Bois, at the Bouffons, in my own house. END
BEGIN NOW With the impetuosity of his adventurous southern temper, he did all he could to cultivate an acquaintance with this lovely countess, making the best of his opportunities in the quadrille and during a waltz that she gave him. END
BEGIN NOW When he told her that he was a cousin of de Beauseant's, the Countess, whom he took for a great lady, asked him to call at her house, and after her parting smile, Rastignac felt convinced that he must make this visit. END
BEGIN NOW He was so lucky as to light upon some one who did not laugh at his ignorance, a fatal defect among the gilded and insolent youth of that period; the coterie of Maulincourts, Maximes de Trailles, de Marsays, Ronquerolles, Ajuda-Pintos, and Vandenesses who shone there in all the glory of coxcombry among the best-dressed women of fashion in Paris&mdash;Lady Brandon, the Duchesse de Langeais, the Comtesse de Kergarouet, de Serizy, the Duchesse de Carigliano, the Comtesse Ferraud, de Lanty, the Marquise d'Aiglemont, Firmiani, the Marquise de Listomere and the Marquise d'Espard, the Duchesse de Maufrigneuse and the Grandlieus. END
BEGIN NOW Luckily, therefore, for him, the novice happened upon the Marquis de Montriveau, the lover of the Duchesse de Langeais, a general as simple as a child; from him Rastignac learned that the Comtesse lived in the Rue du Helder. END
BEGIN NOW Ah, what it is to be young, eager to see the world, greedily on the watch for any chance that brings you nearer the woman of your dreams, and behold two houses open their doors to you! END
BEGIN NOW To set foot in the Vicomtesse de Beauseant's house in the Faubourg Saint-Germain; to fall on your knees before a Comtesse de Restaud in the Chaussee d'Antin; to look at one glance across a vista of Paris drawing-rooms, conscious that, possessing sufficient good looks, you may hope to find aid and protection there in a feminine heart! END
BEGIN NOW To feel ambitious enough to spurn the tight-rope on which you must walk with the steady head of an acrobat for whom a fall is impossible, and to find in a charming woman the best of all balancing poles. END
BEGIN NOW He sat there with his thoughts for a while, Law on the one hand, and Poverty on the other, beholding a radiant vision of a woman rise above the dull, smouldering fire. END
BEGIN NOW Who would not have paused and questioned the future as Eugene was doing? END
BEGIN NOW who would not have pictured it full of success? END
BEGIN NOW His wondering thoughts took wings; he was transported out of the present into that blissful future; he was sitting by de Restaud's side, when a sort of sigh, like the grunt of an overburdened St. Joseph, broke the silence of the night. END
BEGIN NOW It vibrated through the student, who took the sound for a death groan. END
BEGIN NOW He opened his door noiselessly, went out upon the landing, and saw a thin streak of light under Father Goriot's door. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene feared that his neighbor had been taken ill; he went over and looked through the keyhole; the old man was busily engaged in an occupation so singular and so suspicious that Rastignac thought he was only doing a piece of necessary service to society to watch the self-styled vermicelli maker's nocturnal industries. END
BEGIN NOW The table was upturned, and Goriot had doubtless in some way secured a silver plate and cup to the bar before knotting a thick rope round them; he was pulling at this rope with such enormous force that they were being crushed and twisted out of shape; to all appearance he meant to convert the richly wrought metal into ingots. END
BEGIN NOW _Peste!_ what a man! END
BEGIN NOW said Rastignac, as he watched Goriot's muscular arms; there was not a sound in the room while the old man, with the aid of the rope, was kneading the silver like dough. END
BEGIN NOW Was he then, indeed, a thief, or a receiver of stolen goods, who affected imbecility and decrepitude, and lived like a beggar that he might carry on his pursuits the more securely? END
BEGIN NOW Eugene stood for a moment revolving these questions, then he looked again through the keyhole. END
BEGIN NOW Father Goriot had unwound his coil of rope; he had covered the table with a blanket, and was now employed in rolling the flattened mass of silver into a bar, an operation which he performed with marvelous dexterity. END
BEGIN NOW Why, he must be as strong as Augustus, King of Poland! END
BEGIN NOW said Eugene to himself when the bar was nearly finished. END
BEGIN NOW Father Goriot looked sadly at his handiwork, tears fell from his eyes, he blew out the dip which had served him for a light while he manipulated the silver, and Eugene heard him sigh as he lay down again. END
BEGIN NOW He is mad, thought the student. END
BEGIN NOW _Poor child!_ Father Goriot said aloud. END
BEGIN NOW Rastignac, hearing those words, concluded to keep silence; he would not hastily condemn his neighbor. END
BEGIN NOW He was just in the doorway of his room when a strange sound from the staircase below reached his ears; it might have been made by two men coming up in list slippers. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene listened; two men there certainly were, he could hear their breathing. END
BEGIN NOW Yet there had been no sound of opening the street door, no footsteps in the passage. END
BEGIN NOW Suddenly, too, he saw a faint gleam of light on the second story; it came from M. Vautrin's room. END
BEGIN NOW There are a good many mysteries here for a lodging-house! END
BEGIN NOW he said to himself. END
BEGIN NOW He went part of the way downstairs and listened again. END
BEGIN NOW The rattle of gold reached his ears. END
BEGIN NOW In another moment the light was put out, and again he distinctly heard the breathing of two men, but no sound of a door being opened or shut. END
BEGIN NOW The two men went downstairs, the faint sounds growing fainter as they went. END
BEGIN NOW Who is there? END
BEGIN NOW cried Vauquer out of her bedroom window. END
BEGIN NOW I, Vauquer, answered Vautrin's deep bass voice. END
BEGIN NOW I am coming in. END
BEGIN NOW That is odd! END
BEGIN NOW Christophe drew the bolts, said Eugene, going back to his room. END
BEGIN NOW You have to sit up at night, it seems, if you really mean to know all that is going on about you in Paris. END
BEGIN NOW These incidents turned his thought from his ambitious dreams; he betook himself to his work, but his thought wandered back to Father Goriot's suspicious occupation; de Restaud's face swam again and again before his eyes like a vision of a brilliant future; and at last he lay down and slept with clenched fists. END
BEGIN NOW When a young man makes up his mind that he will work all night, the chances are that seven times out of ten he will sleep till morning. END
BEGIN NOW Such vigils do not begin before we are turned twenty. END
BEGIN NOW The next morning Paris was wrapped in one of the dense fogs that throw the most punctual people out in their calculations as to the time; even the most business-like folk fail to keep their appointments in such weather, and ordinary mortals wake up at noon and fancy it is eight o'clock. END
BEGIN NOW On this morning it was half-past nine, and Vauquer still lay abed. END
BEGIN NOW Christophe was late, Sylvie was late, but the two sat comfortably taking their coffee as usual. END
BEGIN NOW It was Sylvie's custom to take the cream off the milk destined for the boarders' breakfast for her own, and to boil the remainder for some time, so that madame should not discover this illegal exaction. END
BEGIN NOW Sylvie, said Christophe, as he dipped a piece of toast into the coffee, M. Vautrin, who is not such a bad sort, all the same, had two people come to see him again last night. END
BEGIN NOW If madame says anything, mind you say nothing about it. END
BEGIN NOW Has he given you something? END
BEGIN NOW He gave me a five-franc piece this month, which is as good as saying, 'Hold your tongue.' END
BEGIN NOW Except him and Couture, who doesn't look twice at every penny, there's no one in the house that doesn't try to get back with the left hand all that they give with the right at New Year, said Sylvie. END
BEGIN NOW And, after all, said Christophe, what do they give you? END
BEGIN NOW A miserable five-franc piece. END
BEGIN NOW There is Father Goriot, who has cleaned his shoes himself these two years past. END
BEGIN NOW There is that old beggar Poiret, who goes without blacking altogether; he would sooner drink it than put it on his boots. END
BEGIN NOW Then there is that whipper-snapper of a student, who gives me a couple of francs. END
BEGIN NOW Two francs will not pay for my brushes, and he sells his old clothes, and gets more for them than they are worth. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW they're a shabby lot! END
BEGIN NOW Pooh! END
BEGIN NOW said Sylvie, sipping her coffee, our places are the best in the Quarter, that I know. END
BEGIN NOW But about that great big chap Vautrin, Christophe; has any one told you anything about him? END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW I met a gentleman in the street a few days ago; he said to me, 'There's a gentleman in your place, isn't there? END
BEGIN NOW a tall man that dyes his whiskers?' END
BEGIN NOW I told him, 'No, sir; they aren't dyed. END
BEGIN NOW A gay fellow like him hasn't the time to do it.' END
BEGIN NOW And when I told M. Vautrin about it afterwards, he said, 'Quite right, my boy. END
BEGIN NOW That is the way to answer them. END
BEGIN NOW There is nothing more unpleasant than to have your little weaknesses known; it might spoil many a match.' END
BEGIN NOW Well, and for my part, said Sylvie, a man tried to humbug me at the market wanting to know if I had seen him put on his shirt. END
BEGIN NOW Such bosh! END
BEGIN NOW There, she cried, interrupting herself, that's a quarter to ten striking at the Val-de-Grace, and not a soul stirring! END
BEGIN NOW Pooh! END
BEGIN NOW they are all gone out. END
BEGIN NOW Couture and the girl went out at eight o'clock to take the wafer at Saint-Etienne. END
BEGIN NOW Father Goriot started off somewhere with a parcel, and the student won't be back from his lecture till ten o'clock. END
BEGIN NOW I saw them go while I was sweeping the stairs; Father Goriot knocked up against me, and his parcel was as hard as iron. END
BEGIN NOW What is the old fellow up to, I wonder? END
BEGIN NOW He is as good as a plaything for the rest of them; they can never let him alone; but he is a good man, all the same, and worth more than all of them put together. END
BEGIN NOW He doesn't give you much himself, but he sometimes sends you with a message to ladies who fork out famous tips; they are dressed grandly, too. END
BEGIN NOW His daughters, as he calls them, eh? END
BEGIN NOW There are a dozen of them. END
BEGIN NOW I have never been to more than two&mdash;the two who came here. END
BEGIN NOW There is madame moving overhead; I shall have to go, or she will raise a fine racket. END
BEGIN NOW Just keep an eye on the milk, Christophe; don't let the cat get at it. END
BEGIN NOW Sylvie went up to her mistress' room. END
BEGIN NOW Sylvie! END
BEGIN NOW How is this? END
BEGIN NOW It's nearly ten o'clock, and you let me sleep like a dormouse! END
BEGIN NOW Such a thing has never happened before. END
BEGIN NOW It's the fog; it is that thick, you could cut it with a knife. END
BEGIN NOW But how about breakfast? END
BEGIN NOW Bah! END
BEGIN NOW the boarders are possessed, I'm sure. END
BEGIN NOW They all cleared out before there was a wink of daylight. END
BEGIN NOW Do speak properly, Sylvie, Vauquer retorted; say a blink of daylight. END
BEGIN NOW Ah, well, madame, whichever you please. END
BEGIN NOW Anyhow, you can have breakfast at ten o'clock. END
BEGIN NOW La Michonnette and Poiret have neither of them stirred. END
BEGIN NOW There are only those two upstairs, and they are sleeping like the logs they are. END
BEGIN NOW But, Sylvie, you put their names together as if&mdash;- As if what? END
BEGIN NOW said Sylvie, bursting into a guffaw. END
BEGIN NOW The two of them make a pair. END
BEGIN NOW It is a strange thing, isn't it, Sylvie, how M. Vautrin got in last night after Christophe had bolted the door? END
BEGIN NOW Not at all, madame. END
BEGIN NOW Christophe heard M. Vautrin, and went down and undid the door. END
BEGIN NOW And here are you imagining that&mdash;-? END
BEGIN NOW Give me my bodice, and be quick and get breakfast ready. END
BEGIN NOW Dish up the rest of the mutton with the potatoes, and you can put the stewed pears on the table, those at five a penny. END
BEGIN NOW A few moments later Vauquer came down, just in time to see the cat knock down a plate that covered a bowl of milk, and begin to lap in all haste. END
BEGIN NOW Mistigris! END
BEGIN NOW she cried. END
BEGIN NOW The cat fled, but promptly returned to rub against her ankles. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW yes, you can wheedle, you old hypocrite! END
BEGIN NOW she said. END
BEGIN NOW Sylvie! END
BEGIN NOW Sylvie! END
BEGIN NOW Yes, madame; what is it? END
BEGIN NOW Just see what the cat has done! END
BEGIN NOW It is all that stupid Christophe's fault. END
BEGIN NOW I told him to stop and lay the table. END
BEGIN NOW What has become of him? END
BEGIN NOW Don't you worry, madame; Father Goriot shall have it. END
BEGIN NOW I will fill it up with water, and he won't know the difference; he never notices anything, not even what he eats. END
BEGIN NOW I wonder where the old heathen can have gone? END
BEGIN NOW said Vauquer, setting the plates round the table. END
BEGIN NOW Who knows? END
BEGIN NOW He is up to all sorts of tricks. END
BEGIN NOW I have overslept myself, said Vauquer. END
BEGIN NOW But madame looks as fresh as a rose, all the same. END
BEGIN NOW The door bell rang at that moment, and Vautrin came through the sitting-room, singing loudly: 'Tis the same old story everywhere, A roving heart and a roving glance. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW Mamma Vauquer! END
BEGIN NOW good-morning! END
BEGIN NOW he cried at the sight of his hostess, and he put his arm gaily round her waist. END
BEGIN NOW There! END
BEGIN NOW have done&mdash;- 'Impertinence!' END
BEGIN NOW Say it! END
BEGIN NOW he answered. END
BEGIN NOW Come, say it! END
BEGIN NOW Now, isn't that what you really mean? END
BEGIN NOW Stop a bit, I will help you to set the table. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW I am a nice man, am I not? END
BEGIN NOW For the locks of brown and the golden hair A sighing lover... Oh! END
BEGIN NOW I have just seen something so funny&mdash;-\.... led by chance. END
BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW asked the widow. END
BEGIN NOW Father Goriot in the goldsmith's shop in the Rue Dauphine at half-past eight this morning. END
BEGIN NOW They buy old spoons and forks and gold lace there, and Goriot sold a piece of silver plate for a good round sum. END
BEGIN NOW It had been twisted out of shape very neatly for a man that's not used to the trade. END
BEGIN NOW Really? END
BEGIN NOW You don't say so? END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW One of my friends is expatriating himself; I had been to see him off on board the Royal Mail steamer, and was coming back here. END
BEGIN NOW I waited after that to see what Father Goriot would do; it is a comical affair. END
BEGIN NOW He came back to this quarter of the world, to the Rue des Gres, and went into a money-lender's house; everybody knows him, Gobseck, a stuck-up rascal, that would make dominoes out of his father's bones, a Turk, a heathen, an old Jew, a Greek; it would be a difficult matter to rob _him_, for he puts all his coin into the Bank. END
BEGIN NOW Then what was Father Goriot doing there? END
BEGIN NOW Doing? END
BEGIN NOW said Vautrin. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing; he was bent on his own undoing. END
BEGIN NOW He is a simpleton, stupid enough to ruin himself by running after&mdash;- There he is! END
BEGIN NOW cried Sylvie. END
BEGIN NOW Christophe, cried Father Goriot's voice, come upstairs with me. END
BEGIN NOW Christophe went up, and shortly afterwards came down again. END
BEGIN NOW Where are you going? END
BEGIN NOW Vauquer asked of her servant. END
BEGIN NOW Out on an errand for M. Goriot. END
BEGIN NOW What may that be? END
BEGIN NOW said Vautrin, pouncing on a letter in Christophe's hand. END
BEGIN NOW _ la Comtesse Anastasie de Restaud_, he read. END
BEGIN NOW Where are you going with it? END
BEGIN NOW he added, as he gave the letter back to Christophe. END
BEGIN NOW To the Rue du Helder. END
BEGIN NOW I have orders to give this into her hands myself. END
BEGIN NOW What is there inside it? END
BEGIN NOW said Vautrin, holding the letter up to the light. END
BEGIN NOW A banknote? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW He peered into the envelope. END
BEGIN NOW A receipted account! END
BEGIN NOW he cried. END
BEGIN NOW My word! END
BEGIN NOW 'tis a gallant old dotard. END
BEGIN NOW Off with you, old chap, he said, bringing down a hand on Christophe's head, and spinning the man round like a thimble; you will have a famous tip. END
BEGIN NOW By this time the table was set. END
BEGIN NOW Sylvie was boiling the milk, Vauquer was lighting a fire in the stove with some assistance from Vautrin, who kept humming to himself: The same old story everywhere, A roving heart and a roving glance. END
BEGIN NOW When everything was ready, Couture and Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Taillefer came in. END
BEGIN NOW Where have you been this morning, fair lady? END
BEGIN NOW said Vauquer, turning to Couture. END
BEGIN NOW We have just been to say our prayers at Saint-Etienne du Mont. END
BEGIN NOW To-day is the day when we must go to see M. Taillefer. END
BEGIN NOW Poor little thing! END
BEGIN NOW She is trembling like a leaf, Couture went on, as she seated herself before the fire and held the steaming soles of her boots to the blaze. END
BEGIN NOW Warm yourself, Victorine, said Vauquer. END
BEGIN NOW It is quite right and proper, mademoiselle, to pray to Heaven to soften your father's heart, said Vautrin, as he drew a chair nearer to the orphan girl; but that is not enough. END
BEGIN NOW What you want is a friend who will give the monster a piece of his mind; a barbarian that has three millions (so they say), and will not give you a dowry; and a pretty girl needs a dowry nowadays. END
BEGIN NOW Poor child! END
BEGIN NOW said Vauquer. END
BEGIN NOW Never mind, my pet, your wretch of a father is going just the way to bring trouble upon himself. END
BEGIN NOW Victorine's eyes filled with tears at the words, and the widow checked herself at a sign from Couture. END
BEGIN NOW If we could only see him! END
BEGIN NOW said the Commissary-General's widow; if I could speak to him myself and give him his wife's last letter! END
BEGIN NOW I have never dared to run the risk of sending it by post; he knew my handwriting&mdash;- 'Oh woman, persecuted and injured innocent!' END
BEGIN NOW exclaimed Vautrin, breaking in upon her. END
BEGIN NOW So that is how you are, is it? END
BEGIN NOW In a few days' time I will look into your affairs, and it will be all right, you shall see. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW sir, said Victorine, with a tearful but eager glance at Vautrin, who showed no sign of being touched by it, if you know of any way of communicating with my father, please be sure and tell him that his affection and my mother's honor are more to me than all the money in the world. END
BEGIN NOW If you can induce him to relent a little towards me, I will pray to God for you. END
BEGIN NOW You may be sure of my gratitude&mdash;- _The same old story everywhere_, sang Vautrin, with a satirical intonation. END
BEGIN NOW At this juncture, Goriot, Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau, and Poiret came downstairs together; possibly the scent of the gravy which Sylvie was making to serve with the mutton had announced breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW The seven people thus assembled bade each other good-morning, and took their places at the table; the clock struck ten, and the student's footstep was heard outside. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW here you are, M. Eugene, said Sylvie; every one is breakfasting at home to-day. END
BEGIN NOW The student exchanged greetings with the lodgers, and sat down beside Goriot. END
BEGIN NOW I have just met with a queer adventure, he said, as he helped himself abundantly to the mutton, and cut a slice of bread, which Vauquer's eyes gauged as usual. END
BEGIN NOW An adventure? END
BEGIN NOW queried Poiret. END
BEGIN NOW Well, and what is there to astonish you in that, old boy? END
BEGIN NOW Vautrin asked of Poiret. END
BEGIN NOW M. Eugene is cut out for that kind of thing. END
BEGIN NOW Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Taillefer stole a timid glance at the young student. END
BEGIN NOW Tell us about your adventure! END
BEGIN NOW demanded M. Vautrin. END
BEGIN NOW Yesterday evening I went to a ball given by a cousin of mine, the Vicomtesse de Beauseant. END
BEGIN NOW She has a magnificent house; the rooms are hung with silk&mdash;in short, it was a splendid affair, and I was as happy as a king&mdash; Fisher, put in Vautrin, interrupting. END
BEGIN NOW What do you mean, sir? END
BEGIN NOW said Eugene sharply. END
BEGIN NOW I said 'fisher,' because kingfishers see a good deal more fun than kings. END
BEGIN NOW Quite true; I would much rather be the little careless bird than a king, said Poiret the ditto-ist, because&mdash;- In fact &mdash;the law-student cut him short&mdash; I danced with one of the handsomest women in the room, a charming countess, the most exquisite creature I have ever seen. END
BEGIN NOW There was peach blossom in her hair, and she had the loveliest bouquet of flowers&mdash;real flowers, that scented the air&mdash;-but there! END
BEGIN NOW it is no use trying to describe a woman glowing with the dance. END
BEGIN NOW You ought to have seen her! END
BEGIN NOW Well, and this morning I met this divine countess about nine o'clock, on foot in the Rue de Gres. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW how my heart beat! END
BEGIN NOW I began to think&mdash;- That she was coming here, said Vautrin, with a keen look at the student. END
BEGIN NOW I expect that she was going to call on old Gobseck, a money-lender. END
BEGIN NOW If ever you explore a Parisian woman's heart, you will find the money-lender first, and the lover afterwards. END
BEGIN NOW Your countess is called Anastasie de Restaud, and she lives in the Rue du Helder. END
BEGIN NOW The student stared hard at Vautrin. END
BEGIN NOW Father Goriot raised his head at the words, and gave the two speakers a glance so full of intelligence and uneasiness that the lodgers beheld him with astonishment. END
BEGIN NOW Then Christophe was too late, and she must have gone to him! END
BEGIN NOW cried Goriot, with anguish in his voice. END
BEGIN NOW It is just as I guessed, said Vautrin, leaning over to whisper in Vauquer's ear. END
BEGIN NOW Goriot went on with his breakfast, but seemed unconscious of what he was doing. END
BEGIN NOW He had never looked more stupid nor more taken up with his own thoughts than he did at that moment. END
BEGIN NOW Who the devil could have told you her name, M. Vautrin? END
BEGIN NOW asked Eugene. END
BEGIN NOW Aha! END
BEGIN NOW there you are! END
BEGIN NOW answered Vautrin. END
BEGIN NOW Old Father Goriot there knew it quite well! END
BEGIN NOW and why should I not know it too? END
BEGIN NOW M. Goriot? END
BEGIN NOW the student cried. END
BEGIN NOW What is it? END
BEGIN NOW asked the old man. END
BEGIN NOW So she was very beautiful, was she, yesterday night? END
BEGIN NOW Who? END
BEGIN NOW de Restaud. END
BEGIN NOW Look at the old wretch, said Vauquer, speaking to Vautrin; how his eyes light up! END
BEGIN NOW Then does he really keep her? END
BEGIN NOW said Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau, in a whisper to the student. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW yes, she was tremendously pretty, Eugene answered. END
BEGIN NOW Father Goriot watched him with eager eyes. END
BEGIN NOW If de Beauseant had not been there, my divine countess would have been the queen of the ball; none of the younger men had eyes for any one else. END
BEGIN NOW I was the twelfth on her list, and she danced every quadrille. END
BEGIN NOW The other women were furious. END
BEGIN NOW She must have enjoyed herself, if ever creature did! END
BEGIN NOW It is a true saying that there is no more beautiful sight than a frigate in full sail, a galloping horse, or a woman dancing. END
BEGIN NOW So the wheel turns, said Vautrin; yesterday night at a duchess' ball, this morning in a money-lender's office, on the lowest rung of the ladder&mdash;just like a Parisienne! END
BEGIN NOW If their husbands cannot afford to pay for their frantic extravagance, they will sell themselves. END
BEGIN NOW Or if they cannot do that, they will tear out their mothers' hearts to find something to pay for their splendor. END
BEGIN NOW They will turn the world upside down. END
BEGIN NOW Just a Parisienne through and through! END
BEGIN NOW Father Goriot's face, which had shone at the student's words like the sun on a bright day, clouded over all at once at this cruel speech of Vautrin's. END
BEGIN NOW Well, said Vauquer, but where is your adventure? END
BEGIN NOW Did you speak to her? END
BEGIN NOW Did you ask her if she wanted to study law? END
BEGIN NOW She did not see me, said Eugene. END
BEGIN NOW But only think of meeting one of the prettiest women in Paris in the Rue des Gres at nine o'clock! END
BEGIN NOW She could not have reached home after the ball till two o'clock this morning. END
BEGIN NOW Wasn't it queer? END
BEGIN NOW There is no place like Paris for this sort of adventures. END
BEGIN NOW Pshaw! END
BEGIN NOW much funnier things than _that_ happen here! END
BEGIN NOW exclaimed Vautrin. END
BEGIN NOW Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Taillefer had scarcely heeded the talk, she was so absorbed by the thought of the new attempt that she was about to make. END
BEGIN NOW Couture made a sign that it was time to go upstairs and dress; the two ladies went out, and Father Goriot followed their example. END
BEGIN NOW Well, did you see? END
BEGIN NOW said Vauquer, addressing Vautrin and the rest of the circle. END
BEGIN NOW He is ruining himself for those women, that is plain. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing will ever make me believe that that beautiful Comtesse de Restaud is anything to Father Goriot, cried the student. END
BEGIN NOW Well, and if you don't, broke in Vautrin, we are not set on convincing you. END
BEGIN NOW You are too young to know Paris thoroughly yet; later on you will find out that there are what we call men with a passion&mdash;- Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau gave Vautrin a quick glance at these words. END
BEGIN NOW They seemed to be like the sound of a trumpet to a trooper's horse. END
BEGIN NOW Aha! END
BEGIN NOW said Vautrin, stopping in his speech to give her a searching glance, so we have had our little experiences, have we? END
BEGIN NOW The old maid lowered her eyes like a nun who sees a statue. END
BEGIN NOW Well, he went on, when folk of that kind get a notion into their heads, they cannot drop it. END
BEGIN NOW They must drink the water from some particular spring&mdash;it is stagnant as often as not; but they will sell their wives and families, they will sell their own souls to the devil to get it. END
BEGIN NOW For some this spring is play, or the stock-exchange, or music, or a collection of pictures or insects; for others it is some woman who can give them the dainties they like. END
BEGIN NOW You might offer these last all the women on earth&mdash;they would turn up their noses; they will have the only one who can gratify their passion. END
BEGIN NOW It often happens that the woman does not care for them at all, and treats them cruelly; they buy their morsels of satisfaction very dear; but no matter, the fools are never tired of it; they will take their last blanket to the pawnbroker's to give their last five-franc piece to her. END
BEGIN NOW Father Goriot here is one of that sort. END
BEGIN NOW He is discreet, so the Countess exploits him&mdash;just the way of the gay world. END
BEGIN NOW The poor old fellow thinks of her and of nothing else. END
BEGIN NOW In all other respects you see he is a stupid animal; but get him on that subject, and his eyes sparkle like diamonds. END
BEGIN NOW That secret is not difficult to guess. END
BEGIN NOW He took some plate himself this morning to the melting-pot, and I saw him at Daddy Gobseck's in the Rue des Gres. END
BEGIN NOW And now, mark what follows&mdash;he came back here, and gave a letter for the Comtesse de Restaud to that noodle of a Christophe, who showed us the address; there was a receipted bill inside it. END
BEGIN NOW It is clear that it was an urgent matter if the Countess also went herself to the old money lender. END
BEGIN NOW Father Goriot has financed her handsomely. END
BEGIN NOW There is no need to tack a tale together; the thing is self-evident. END
BEGIN NOW So that shows you, sir student, that all the time your Countess was smiling, dancing, flirting, swaying her peach-flower crowned head, with her gown gathered into her hand, her slippers were pinching her, as they say; she was thinking of her protested bills, or her lover's protested bills. END
BEGIN NOW You have made me wild to know the truth, cried Eugene; I will go to call on de Restaud to-morrow. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, echoed Poiret; you must go and call on de Restaud. END
BEGIN NOW And perhaps you will find Father Goriot there, who will take payment for the assistance he politely rendered. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene looked disgusted. END
BEGIN NOW Why, then, this Paris of yours is a slough. END
BEGIN NOW And an uncommonly queer slough, too, replied Vautrin. END
BEGIN NOW The mud splashes you as you drive through it in your carriage&mdash;you are a respectable person; you go afoot and are splashed&mdash;you are a scoundrel. END
BEGIN NOW You are so unlucky as to walk off with something or other belonging to somebody else, and they exhibit you as a curiosity in the Place du Palais-de-Justice; you steal a million, and you are pointed out in every salon as a model of virtue. END
BEGIN NOW And you pay thirty millions for the police and the courts of justice, for the maintenance of law and order! END
BEGIN NOW A pretty slate of things it is! END
BEGIN NOW What, cried Vauquer, has Father Goriot really melted down his silver posset-dish? END
BEGIN NOW There were two turtle-doves on the lid, were there not? END
BEGIN NOW asked Eugene. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, that there were. END
BEGIN NOW Then, was he fond of it? END
BEGIN NOW said Eugene. END
BEGIN NOW He cried while he was breaking up the cup and plate. END
BEGIN NOW I happened to see him by accident. END
BEGIN NOW It was dear to him as his own life, answered the widow. END
BEGIN NOW There! END
BEGIN NOW you see how infatuated the old fellow is! END
BEGIN NOW cried Vautrin. END
BEGIN NOW The woman yonder can coax the soul out of him. END
BEGIN NOW The student went up to his room. END
BEGIN NOW Vautrin went out, and a few moments later Couture and Victorine drove away in a cab which Sylvie had called for them. END
BEGIN NOW Poiret gave his arm to Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau, and they went together to spend the two sunniest hours of the day in the Jardin des Plantes. END
BEGIN NOW Well, those two are as good as married, was the portly Sylvie's comment. END
BEGIN NOW They are going out together to-day for the first time. END
BEGIN NOW They are such a couple of dry sticks that if they happen to strike against each other they will draw sparks like flint and steel. END
BEGIN NOW Keep clear of Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau's shawl, then, said Vauquer, laughing; it would flare up like tinder. END
BEGIN NOW At four o'clock that evening, when Goriot came in, he saw, by the light of two smoky lamps, that Victorine's eyes were red. END
BEGIN NOW Vauquer was listening to the history of the visit made that morning to M. Taillefer; it had been made in vain. END
BEGIN NOW Taillefer was tired of the annual application made by his daughter and her elderly friend; he gave them a personal interview in order to arrive at an understanding with them. END
BEGIN NOW My dear lady, said Couture, addressing Vauquer, just imagine it; he did not even ask Victorine to sit down, she was standing the whole time. END
BEGIN NOW He said to me quite coolly, without putting himself in a passion, that we might spare ourselves the trouble of going there; that the young lady (he would not call her his daughter) was injuring her cause by importuning him (_importuning!_ once a year, the wretch! END
BEGIN NOW ); that as Victorine's mother had nothing when he married her, Victorine ought not to expect anything from him; in fact, he said the most cruel things, that made the poor child burst out crying. END
BEGIN NOW The little thing threw herself at her father's feet and spoke up bravely; she said that she only persevered in her visits for her mother's sake; that she would obey him without a murmur, but that she begged him to read her poor dead mother's farewell letter. END
BEGIN NOW She took it up and gave it to him, saying the most beautiful things in the world, most beautifully expressed; I do not know where she learned them; God must have put them into her head, for the poor child was inspired to speak so nicely that it made me cry like a fool to hear her talk. END
BEGIN NOW And what do you think the monster was doing all the time? END
BEGIN NOW Cutting his nails! END
BEGIN NOW He took the letter that poor Taillefer had soaked with tears, and flung it on to the chimney-piece. END
BEGIN NOW 'That is all right,' he said. END
BEGIN NOW He held out his hands to raise his daughter, but she covered them with kisses, and he drew them away again. END
BEGIN NOW Scandalous, isn't it? END
BEGIN NOW And his great booby of a son came in and took no notice of his sister. END
BEGIN NOW What inhuman wretches they must be! END
BEGIN NOW said Father Goriot. END
BEGIN NOW And then they both went out of the room, Couture went on, without heeding the worthy vermicelli maker's exclamation; father and son bowed to me, and asked me to excuse them on account of urgent business! END
BEGIN NOW That is the history of our call. END
BEGIN NOW Well, he has seen his daughter at any rate. END
BEGIN NOW How he can refuse to acknowledge her I cannot think, for they are as alike as two peas. END
BEGIN NOW The boarders dropped in one after another, interchanging greetings and empty jokes that certain classes of Parisians regard as humorous and witty. END
BEGIN NOW Dulness is their prevailing ingredient, and the whole point consists in mispronouncing a word or a gesture. END
BEGIN NOW This kind of argot is always changing. END
BEGIN NOW The essence of the jest consists in some catchword suggested by a political event, an incident in the police courts, a street song, or a bit of burlesque at some theatre, and forgotten in a month. END
BEGIN NOW Anything and everything serves to keep up a game of battledore and shuttlecock with words and ideas. END
BEGIN NOW The diorama, a recent invention, which carried an optical illusion a degree further than panoramas, had given rise to a mania among art students for ending every word with _rama_. END
BEGIN NOW The Maison Vauquer had caught the infection from a young artist among the boarders. END
BEGIN NOW Well, Monsieur-r-r Poiret, said the _employe_ from the Museum, how is your health-orama? END
BEGIN NOW Then, without waiting for an answer, he turned to Couture and Victorine with a Ladies, you seem melancholy. END
BEGIN NOW Is dinner ready? END
BEGIN NOW cried Horace Bianchon, a medical student, and a friend of Rastignac's; my stomach is sinking _usque ad talones_. END
BEGIN NOW There is an uncommon _frozerama_ outside, said Vautrin. END
BEGIN NOW Make room there, Father Goriot! END
BEGIN NOW Confound it, your foot covers the whole front of the stove. END
BEGIN NOW Illustrious M. Vautrin, put in Bianchon, why do you say _frozerama_? END
BEGIN NOW It is incorrect; it should be _frozenrama_. END
BEGIN NOW No, it shouldn't, said the official from the Museum; _frozerama_ is right by the same rule that you say 'My feet are _froze_.' END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW ah! END
BEGIN NOW Here is his Excellency the Marquis de Rastignac, Doctor of the Law of Contraries, cried Bianchon, seizing Eugene by the throat, and almost throttling him. END
BEGIN NOW Hallo there! END
BEGIN NOW hallo! END
BEGIN NOW Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau came noiselessly in, bowed to the rest of the party, and took her place beside the three women without saying a word. END
BEGIN NOW That old bat always makes me shudder, said Bianchon in a low voice, indicating Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau to Vautrin. END
BEGIN NOW I have studied Gall's system, and I am sure she has the bump of Judas. END
BEGIN NOW Then you have seen a case before? END
BEGIN NOW said Vautrin. END
BEGIN NOW Who has not? END
BEGIN NOW answered Bianchon. END
BEGIN NOW Upon my word, that ghastly old maid looks just like one of the long worms that will gnaw a beam through, give them time enough. END
BEGIN NOW That is the way, young man, returned he of the forty years and the dyed whiskers: The rose has lived the life of a rose&mdash; A morning's space. END
BEGIN NOW Aha! END
BEGIN NOW here is a magnificent _soupe-au-rama_, cried Poiret as Christophe came in bearing the soup with cautious heed. END
BEGIN NOW I beg your pardon, sir, said Vauquer; it is _soupe aux choux_. END
BEGIN NOW All the young men roared with laughter. END
BEGIN NOW Had you there, Poiret! END
BEGIN NOW Poir-r-r-rette! END
BEGIN NOW she had you there! END
BEGIN NOW Score two points to Mamma Vauquer, said Vautrin. END
BEGIN NOW Did any of you notice the fog this morning? END
BEGIN NOW asked the official. END
BEGIN NOW It was a frantic fog, said Bianchon, a fog unparalleled, doleful, melancholy, sea-green, asthmatical&mdash;a Goriot of a fog! END
BEGIN NOW A Goriorama, said the art student, because you couldn't see a thing in it. END
BEGIN NOW Hey! END
BEGIN NOW Milord Gaoriotte, they air talking about yoo-o-ou! END
BEGIN NOW Father Goriot, seated at the lower end of the table, close to the door through which the servant entered, raised his face; he had smelt at a scrap of bread that lay under his table napkin, an old trick acquired in his commercial capacity, that still showed itself at times. END
BEGIN NOW Well, Madame Vauquer cried in sharp tones, that rang above the rattle of spoons and plates and the sound of other voices, and is there anything the matter with the bread? END
BEGIN NOW Nothing whatever, madame, he answered; on the contrary, it is made of the best quality of corn; flour from Etampes. END
BEGIN NOW How could you tell? END
BEGIN NOW asked Eugene. END
BEGIN NOW By the color, by the flavor. END
BEGIN NOW You knew the flavor by the smell, I suppose, said Vauquer. END
BEGIN NOW You have grown so economical, you will find out how to live on the smell of cooking at last. END
BEGIN NOW Take out a patent for it, then, cried the Museum official; you would make a handsome fortune. END
BEGIN NOW Never mind him, said the artist; he does that sort of thing to delude us into thinking that he was a vermicelli maker. END
BEGIN NOW Your nose is a corn-sampler, it appears? END
BEGIN NOW inquired the official. END
BEGIN NOW Corn _what_? END
BEGIN NOW asked Bianchon. END
BEGIN NOW Corn-el. END
BEGIN NOW Corn-et. END
BEGIN NOW Corn-elian. END
BEGIN NOW Corn-ice. END
BEGIN NOW Corn-ucopia. END
BEGIN NOW Corn-crake. END
BEGIN NOW Corn-cockle. END
BEGIN NOW Corn-orama. END
BEGIN NOW The eight responses came like a rolling fire from every part of the room, and the laughter that followed was the more uproarious because poor Father Goriot stared at the others with a puzzled look, like a foreigner trying to catch the meaning of words in a language which he does not understand. END
BEGIN NOW Corn?... END
BEGIN NOW he said, turning to Vautrin, his next neighbor. END
BEGIN NOW Corn on your foot, old man! END
BEGIN NOW said Vautrin, and he drove Father Goriot's cap down over his eyes by a blow on the crown. END
BEGIN NOW The poor old man thus suddenly attacked was for a moment too bewildered to do anything. END
BEGIN NOW Christophe carried off his plate, thinking that he had finished his soup, so that when Goriot had pushed back his cap from his eyes his spoon encountered the table. END
BEGIN NOW Every one burst out laughing. END
BEGIN NOW You are a disagreeable joker, sir, said the old man, and if you take any further liberties with me&mdash;- Well, what then, old boy? END
BEGIN NOW Vautrin interrupted. END
BEGIN NOW Well, then, you shall pay dearly for it some day&mdash;- Down below, eh? END
BEGIN NOW said the artist, in the little dark corner where they put naughty boys. END
BEGIN NOW Well, mademoiselle, Vautrin said, turning to Victorine, you are eating nothing. END
BEGIN NOW So papa was refractory, was he? END
BEGIN NOW A monster! END
BEGIN NOW said Couture. END
BEGIN NOW Mademoiselle might make application for aliment pending her suit; she is not eating anything. END
BEGIN NOW Eh! END
BEGIN NOW eh! END
BEGIN NOW just see how Father Goriot is staring at Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Victorine. END
BEGIN NOW The old man had forgotten his dinner, he was so absorbed in gazing at the poor girl; the sorrow in her face was unmistakable,&mdash;the slighted love of a child whose father would not recognize her. END
BEGIN NOW We are mistaken about Father Goriot, my dear boy, said Eugene in a low voice. END
BEGIN NOW He is not an idiot, nor wanting in energy. END
BEGIN NOW Try your Gall system on him, and let me know what you think. END
BEGIN NOW I saw him crush a silver dish last night as if it had been made of wax; there seems to be something extraordinary going on in his mind just now, to judge by his face. END
BEGIN NOW His life is so mysterious that it must be worth studying. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW you may laugh, Bianchon; I am not joking. END
BEGIN NOW The man is a subject, is he? END
BEGIN NOW said Bianchon; all right! END
BEGIN NOW I will dissect him, if he will give me the chance. END
BEGIN NOW No; feel his bumps. END
BEGIN NOW Hm!&mdash;his stupidity might perhaps be contagious. END
BEGIN NOW The next day Rastignac dressed himself very elegantly, and about three o'clock in the afternoon went to call on de Restaud. END
BEGIN NOW On the way thither he indulged in the wild intoxicating dreams which fill a young head so full of delicious excitement. END
BEGIN NOW Young men at his age take no account of obstacles nor of dangers; they see success in every direction; imagination has free play, and turns their lives into a romance; they are saddened or discouraged by the collapse of one of the visionary schemes that have no existence save in their heated fancy. END
BEGIN NOW If youth were not ignorant and timid, civilization would be impossible. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene took unheard-of pains to keep himself in a spotless condition, but on his way through the streets he began to think about de Restaud and what he should say to her. END
BEGIN NOW He equipped himself with wit, rehearsed repartees in the course of an imaginary conversation, and prepared certain neat speeches a la Talleyrand, conjuring up a series of small events which should prepare the way for the declaration on which he had based his future; and during these musings the law student was bespattered with mud, and by the time he reached the Palais Royal he was obliged to have his boots blacked and his trousers brushed. END
BEGIN NOW If I were rich, he said, as he changed the five-franc piece he had brought with him in case anything might happen, I would take a cab, then I could think at my ease. END
BEGIN NOW At last he reached the Rue du Helder, and asked for the Comtesse de Restaud. END
BEGIN NOW He bore the contemptuous glances of the servants, who had seen him cross the court on foot, with the cold fury of a man who knows that he will succeed some day. END
BEGIN NOW He understood the meaning of their glances at once, for he had felt his inferiority as soon as he entered the court, where a smart cab was waiting. END
BEGIN NOW All the delights of life in Paris seemed to be implied by this visible and manifest sign of luxury and extravagance. END
BEGIN NOW A fine horse, in magnificent harness, was pawing the ground, and all at once the law student felt out of humor with himself. END
BEGIN NOW Every compartment in his brain which he had thought to find so full of wit was bolted fast; he grew positively stupid. END
BEGIN NOW He sent up his name to the Countess, and waited in the ante-chamber, standing on one foot before a window that looked out upon the court; mechanically he leaned his elbow against the sash, and stared before him. END
BEGIN NOW The time seemed long; he would have left the house but for the southern tenacity of purpose which works miracles when it is single-minded. END
BEGIN NOW Madame is in her boudoir, and cannot see any one at present, sir, said the servant. END
BEGIN NOW She gave me no answer; but if you will go into the dining-room, there is some one already there. END
BEGIN NOW Rastignac was impressed with a sense of the formidable power of the lackey who can accuse or condemn his masters by a word; he coolly opened the door by which the man had just entered the ante-chamber, meaning, no doubt, to show these insolent flunkeys that he was familiar with the house; but he found that he had thoughtlessly precipitated himself into a small room full of dressers, where lamps were standing, and hot-water pipes, on which towels were being dried; a dark passage and a back staircase lay beyond it. END
BEGIN NOW Stifled laughter from the ante-chamber added to his confusion. END
BEGIN NOW This way to the drawing-room, sir, said the servant, with the exaggerated respect which seemed to be one more jest at his expense. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene turned so quickly that he stumbled against a bath. END
BEGIN NOW By good luck, he managed to keep his hat on his head, and saved it from immersion in the water; but just as he turned, a door opened at the further end of the dark passage, dimly lighted by a small lamp. END
BEGIN NOW Rastignac heard voices and the sound of a kiss; one of the speakers was de Restaud, the other was Father Goriot. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene followed the servant through the dining-room into the drawing-room; he went to a window that looked out into the courtyard, and stood there for a while. END
BEGIN NOW He meant to know whether this Goriot was really the Goriot that he knew. END
BEGIN NOW His heart beat unwontedly fast; he remembered Vautrin's hideous insinuations. END
BEGIN NOW A well-dressed young man suddenly emerged from the room almost as Eugene entered it, saying impatiently to the servant who stood at the door: I am going, Maurice. END
BEGIN NOW Tell Madame la Comtesse that I waited more than half an hour for her. END
BEGIN NOW Whereupon this insolent being, who, doubtless, had a right to be insolent, sang an Italian trill, and went towards the window where Eugene was standing, moved thereto quite as much by a desire to see the student's face as by a wish to look out into the courtyard. END
BEGIN NOW But M. le Comte had better wait a moment longer; madame is disengaged, said Maurice, as he returned to the ante-chamber. END
BEGIN NOW Just at that moment Father Goriot appeared close to the gate; he had emerged from a door at the foot of the back staircase. END
BEGIN NOW The worthy soul was preparing to open his umbrella regardless of the fact that the great gate had opened to admit a tilbury, in which a young man with a ribbon at his button-hole was seated. END
BEGIN NOW Father Goriot had scarcely time to start back and save himself. END
BEGIN NOW The horse took fright at the umbrella, swerved, and dashed forward towards the flight of steps. END
BEGIN NOW The young man looked round in annoyance, saw Father Goriot, and greeted him as he went out with constrained courtesy, such as people usually show to a money-lender so long as they require his services, or the sort of respect they feel it necessary to show for some one whose reputation has been blown upon, so that they blush to acknowledge his acquaintance. END
BEGIN NOW Father Goriot gave him a little friendly nod and a good-natured smile. END
BEGIN NOW All this happened with lightning speed. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene was so deeply interested that he forgot that he was not alone till he suddenly heard the Countess' voice. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW Maxime, were you going away? END
BEGIN NOW she said reproachfully, with a shade of pique in her manner. END
BEGIN NOW The Countess had not seen the incident nor the entrance of the tilbury. END
BEGIN NOW Rastignac turned abruptly and saw her standing before him, coquettishly dressed in a loose white cashmere gown with knots of rose-colored ribbon here and there; her hair was carelessly coiled about her head, as is the wont of Parisian women in the morning; there was a soft fragrance about her&mdash;doubtless she was fresh from a bath;&mdash;her graceful form seemed more flexible, her beauty more luxuriant. END
BEGIN NOW Her eyes glistened. END
BEGIN NOW A young man can see everything at a glance; he feels the radiant influence of woman as a plant discerns and absorbs its nutriment from the air; he did not need to touch her hands to feel their cool freshness. END
BEGIN NOW He saw faint rose tints through the cashmere of the dressing gown; it had fallen slightly open, giving glimpses of a bare throat, on which the student's eyes rested. END
BEGIN NOW The Countess had no need of the adventitious aid of corsets; her girdle defined the outlines of her slender waist; her throat was a challenge to love; her feet, thrust into slippers, were daintily small. END
BEGIN NOW As Maxime took her hand and kissed it, Eugene became aware of Maxime's existence, and the Countess saw Eugene. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW is that you M. de Rastignac? END
BEGIN NOW I am very glad to see you, she said, but there was something in her manner that a shrewd observer would have taken as a hint to depart. END
BEGIN NOW Maxime, as the Countess Anastasie had called the young man with the haughty insolence of bearing, looked from Eugene to the lady, and from the lady to Eugene; it was sufficiently evident that he wished to be rid of the latter. END
BEGIN NOW An exact and faithful rendering of the glance might be given in the words: Look here, my dear; I hope you intend to send this little whipper-snapper about his business. END
BEGIN NOW The Countess consulted the young man's face with an intent submissiveness that betrays all the secrets of a woman's heart, and Rastignac all at once began to hate him violently. END
BEGIN NOW To begin with, the sight of the fair carefully arranged curls on the other's comely head had convinced him that his own crop was hideous; Maxime's boots, moreover, were elegant and spotless, while his own, in spite of all his care, bore some traces of his recent walk; and, finally, Maxime's overcoat fitted the outline of his figure gracefully, he looked like a pretty woman, while Eugene was wearing a black coat at half-past two. END
BEGIN NOW The quick-witted child of the Charente felt the disadvantage at which he was placed beside this tall, slender dandy, with the clear gaze and the pale face, one of those men who would ruin orphan children without scruple. END
BEGIN NOW de Restaud fled into the next room without waiting for Eugene to speak; shaking out the skirts of her dressing-gown in her flight, so that she looked like a white butterfly, and Maxime hurried after her. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene, in a fury, followed Maxime and the Countess, and the three stood once more face to face by the hearth in the large drawing-room. END
BEGIN NOW The law student felt quite sure that the odious Maxime found him in the way, and even at the risk of displeasing de Restaud, he meant to annoy the dandy. END
BEGIN NOW It had struck him all at once that he had seen the young man before at de Beauseant's ball; he guessed the relation between Maxime and de Restaud; and with the youthful audacity that commits prodigious blunders or achieves signal success, he said to himself, This is my rival; I mean to cut him out. END
BEGIN NOW Rash resolve! END
BEGIN NOW He did not know that M. le Comte Maxime de Trailles would wait till he was insulted, so as to fire first and kill his man. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene was a sportsman and a good shot, but he had not yet hit the bulls's eye twenty times out of twenty-two. END
BEGIN NOW The young Count dropped into a low chair by the hearth, took up the tongs, and made up the fire so violently and so sulkily, that Anastasie's fair face suddenly clouded over. END
BEGIN NOW She turned to Eugene, with a cool, questioning glance that asked plainly, Why do you not go? END
BEGIN NOW a glance which well-bred people regard as a cue to make their exit. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene assumed an amiable expression. END
BEGIN NOW Madame, he began, I hastened to call upon you&mdash;- He stopped short. END
BEGIN NOW The door opened, and the owner of the tilbury suddenly appeared. END
BEGIN NOW He had left his hat outside, and did not greet the Countess; he looked meditatively at Rastignac, and held out his hand to Maxime with a cordial Good morning, that astonished Eugene not a little. END
BEGIN NOW The young provincial did not understand the amenities of a triple alliance. END
BEGIN NOW M. de Restaud, said the Countess, introducing her husband to the law student. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene bowed profoundly. END
BEGIN NOW This gentleman, she continued, presenting Eugene to her husband, is M. de Rastignac; he is related to la Vicomtesse de Beauseant through the Marcillacs; I had the pleasure of meeting him at her last ball. END
BEGIN NOW _Related to la Vicomtesse de Beauseant through the Marcillacs!_ These words, on which the countess threw ever so slight an emphasis, by reason of the pride that the mistress of a house takes in showing that she only receives people of distinction as visitors in her house, produced a magical effect. END
BEGIN NOW The Count's stiff manner relaxed at once as he returned the student's bow. END
BEGIN NOW Delighted to have an opportunity of making your acquaintance, he said. END
BEGIN NOW Maxime de Trailles himself gave Eugene an uneasy glance, and suddenly dropped his insolent manner. END
BEGIN NOW The mighty name had all the power of a fairy's wand; those closed compartments in the southern brain flew open again; Rastignac's carefully drilled faculties returned. END
BEGIN NOW It was as if a sudden light had pierced the obscurity of this upper world of Paris, and he began to see, though everything was indistinct as yet. END
BEGIN NOW Vauquer's lodging-house and Father Goriot were very far remote from his thoughts. END
BEGIN NOW I thought that the Marcillacs were extinct, the Comte de Restaud said, addressing Eugene. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, they are extinct, answered the law student. END
BEGIN NOW My great-uncle, the Chevalier de Rastignac, married the heiress of the Marcillac family. END
BEGIN NOW They had only one daughter, who married the Marechal de Clarimbault, de Beauseant's grandfather on the mother's side. END
BEGIN NOW We are the younger branch of the family, and the younger branch is all the poorer because my great-uncle, the Vice-Admiral, lost all that he had in the King's service. END
BEGIN NOW The Government during the Revolution refused to admit our claims when the Compagnie des Indes was liquidated. END
BEGIN NOW Was not your great-uncle in command of the _Vengeur_ before ? END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Then he would be acquainted with my grandfather, who commanded the _Warwick_. END
BEGIN NOW Maxime looked at de Restaud and shrugged his shoulders, as who should say, If he is going to discuss nautical matters with that fellow, it is all over with us. END
BEGIN NOW Anastasie understood the glance that M. de Trailles gave her. END
BEGIN NOW With a woman's admirable tact, she began to smile and said: Come with me, Maxime; I have something to say to you. END
BEGIN NOW We will leave you two gentlemen to sail in company on board the _Warwick_ and the _Vengeur_. END
BEGIN NOW She rose to her feet and signed to Maxime to follow her, mirth and mischief in her whole attitude, and the two went in the direction of the boudoir. END
BEGIN NOW The _morganatic_ couple (to use a convenient German expression which has no exact equivalent) had reached the door, when the Count interrupted himself in his talk with Eugene. END
BEGIN NOW Anastasie! END
BEGIN NOW he cried pettishly, just stay a moment, dear; you know very well that&mdash;- I am coming back in a minute, she interrupted; I have a commission for Maxime to execute, and I want to tell him about it. END
BEGIN NOW She came back almost immediately. END
BEGIN NOW She had noticed the inflection in her husband's voice, and knew that it would not be safe to retire to the boudoir; like all women who are compelled to study their husbands' characters in order to have their own way, and whose business it is to know exactly how far they can go without endangering a good understanding, she was very careful to avoid petty collisions in domestic life. END
BEGIN NOW It was Eugene who had brought about this untoward incident; so the Countess looked at Maxime and indicated the law student with an air of exasperation. END
BEGIN NOW M. de Trailles addressed the Count, the Countess, and Eugene with the pointed remark, You are busy, I do not want to interrupt you; good-day, and he went. END
BEGIN NOW Just wait a moment, Maxime! END
BEGIN NOW the Count called after him. END
BEGIN NOW Come and dine with us, said the Countess, leaving Eugene and her husband together once more. END
BEGIN NOW She followed Maxime into the little drawing-room, where they sat together sufficiently long to feel sure that Rastignac had taken his leave. END
BEGIN NOW The law student heard their laughter, and their voices, and the pauses in their talk; he grew malicious, exerted his conversational powers for M. de Restaud, flattered him, and drew him into discussions, to the end that he might see the Countess again and discover the nature of her relations with Father Goriot. END
BEGIN NOW This Countess with a husband and a lover, for Maxime clearly was her lover, was a mystery. END
BEGIN NOW What was the secret tie that bound her to the old tradesman? END
BEGIN NOW This mystery he meant to penetrate, hoping by its means to gain a sovereign ascendency over this fair typical Parisian. END
BEGIN NOW Anastasie! END
BEGIN NOW the Count called again to his wife. END
BEGIN NOW Poor Maxime! END
BEGIN NOW she said, addressing the young man. END
BEGIN NOW Come, we must resign ourselves. END
BEGIN NOW This evening&mdash;- I hope, Nasie, he said in her ear, that you will give orders not to admit that youngster, whose eyes light up like live coals when he looks at you. END
BEGIN NOW He will make you a declaration, and compromise you, and then you will compel me to kill him. END
BEGIN NOW Are you mad, Maxime? END
BEGIN NOW she said. END
BEGIN NOW A young lad of a student is, on the contrary, a capital lightning-conductor; is not that so? END
BEGIN NOW Of course, I mean to make Restaud furiously jealous of him. END
BEGIN NOW Maxime burst out laughing, and went out, followed by the Countess, who stood at the window to watch him into his carriage; he shook his whip, and made his horse prance. END
BEGIN NOW She only returned when the great gate had been closed after him. END
BEGIN NOW What do you think, dear? END
BEGIN NOW cried the Count, her husband, this gentleman's family estate is not far from Verteuil, on the Charente; his great-uncle and my grandfather were acquainted. END
BEGIN NOW Delighted to find that we have acquaintances in common, said the Countess, with a preoccupied manner. END
BEGIN NOW More than you think, said Eugene, in a low voice. END
BEGIN NOW What do you mean? END
BEGIN NOW she asked quickly. END
BEGIN NOW Why, only just now, said the student, I saw a gentleman go out at the gate, Father Goriot, my next door neighbor in the house where I am lodging. END
BEGIN NOW At the sound of this name, and the prefix that embellished it, the Count, who was stirring the fire, let the tongs fall as though they had burned his fingers, and rose to his feet. END
BEGIN NOW Sir, he cried, you might have called him 'Monsieur Goriot'! END
BEGIN NOW The Countess turned pale at first at the sight of her husband's vexation, then she reddened; clearly she was embarrassed, her answer was made in a tone that she tried to make natural, and with an air of assumed carelessness: You could not know any one who is dearer to us both... She broke off, glanced at the piano as if some fancy had crossed her mind, and asked, Are you fond of music, M. de Rastignac? END
BEGIN NOW Exceedingly, answered Eugene, flushing, and disconcerted by a dim suspicion that he had somehow been guilty of a clumsy piece of folly. END
BEGIN NOW Do you sing? END
BEGIN NOW she cried, going to the piano, and, sitting down before it, she swept her fingers over the keyboard from end to end. END
BEGIN NOW R-r-r-rah! END
BEGIN NOW No, madame. END
BEGIN NOW The Comte de Restaud walked to and fro. END
BEGIN NOW That is a pity; you are without one great means of success.&mdash;_Ca-ro, ca-a-ro, ca-a-a-ro, non du-bi-ta-re_, sang the Countess. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene had a second time waved a magic wand when he uttered Goriot's name, but the effect seemed to be entirely opposite to that produced by the formula related to de Beauseant. END
BEGIN NOW His position was not unlike that of some visitor permitted as a favor to inspect a private collection of curiosities, when by inadvertence he comes into collision with a glass case full of sculptured figures, and three or four heads, imperfectly secured, fall at the shock. END
BEGIN NOW He wished the earth would open and swallow him. END
BEGIN NOW de Restaud's expression was reserved and chilly, her eyes had grown indifferent, and sedulously avoided meeting those of the unlucky student of law. END
BEGIN NOW Madame, he said, you wish to talk with M. de Restaud; permit me to wish you good-day&mdash;- The Countess interrupted him by a gesture, saying hastily, Whenever you come to see us, both M. de Restaud and I shall be delighted to see you. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene made a profound bow and took his leave, followed by M. de Restaud, who insisted, in spite of his remonstrances, on accompanying him into the hall. END
BEGIN NOW Neither your mistress nor I are at home to that gentleman when he calls, the Count said to Maurice. END
BEGIN NOW As Eugene set foot on the steps, he saw that it was raining. END
BEGIN NOW Come, said he to himself, somehow I have just made a mess of it, I do not know how. END
BEGIN NOW And now I am going to spoil my hat and coat into the bargain. END
BEGIN NOW I ought to stop in my corner, grind away at law, and never look to be anything but a boorish country magistrate. END
BEGIN NOW How can I go into society, when to manage properly you want a lot of cabs, varnished boots, gold watch chains, and all sorts of things; you have to wear white doeskin gloves that cost six francs in the morning, and primrose kid gloves every evening? END
BEGIN NOW A fig for that old humbug of a Goriot! END
BEGIN NOW When he reached the street door, the driver of a hackney coach, who had probably just deposited a wedding party at their door, and asked nothing better than a chance of making a little money for himself without his employer's knowledge, saw that Eugene had no umbrella, remarked his black coat, white waistcoat, yellow gloves, and varnished boots, and stopped and looked at him inquiringly. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene, in the blind desperation that drives a young man to plunge deeper and deeper into an abyss, as if he might hope to find a fortunate issue in its lowest depths, nodded in reply to the driver's signal, and stepped into the cab; a few stray petals of orange blossom and scraps of wire bore witness to its recent occupation by a wedding party. END
BEGIN NOW Where am I to drive, sir? END
BEGIN NOW demanded the man, who, by this time, had taken off his white gloves. END
BEGIN NOW Confound it! END
BEGIN NOW Eugene said to himself, I am in for it now, and at least I will not spend cab-hire for nothing!&mdash;Drive to the Hotel Beauseant, he said aloud. END
BEGIN NOW Which? END
BEGIN NOW asked the man, a portentous word that reduced Eugene to confusion. END
BEGIN NOW This young man of fashion, species incerta, did not know that there were two Hotels Beauseant; he was not aware how rich he was in relations who did not care about him. END
BEGIN NOW The Vicomte de Beauseant, Rue&mdash;- De Grenelle, interrupted the driver, with a jerk of his head. END
BEGIN NOW You see, there are the hotels of the Marquis and Comte de Beauseant in the Rue Saint-Dominique, he added, drawing up the step. END
BEGIN NOW I know all about that, said Eugene, severely.&mdash; Everybody is laughing at me to-day, it seems! END
BEGIN NOW he said to himself, as he deposited his hat on the opposite seat. END
BEGIN NOW This escapade will cost me a king's ransom, but, at any rate, I shall call on my so-called cousin in a thoroughly aristocratic fashion. END
BEGIN NOW Goriot has cost me ten francs already, the old scoundrel. END
BEGIN NOW My word! END
BEGIN NOW I will tell de Beauseant about my adventure; perhaps it may amuse her. END
BEGIN NOW Doubtless she will know the secret of the criminal relation between that handsome woman and the old rat without a tail. END
BEGIN NOW It would be better to find favor in my cousin's eyes than to come in contact with that shameless woman, who seems to me to have very expensive tastes. END
BEGIN NOW Surely the beautiful Vicomtesse's personal interest would turn the scale for me, when the mere mention of her name produces such an effect. END
BEGIN NOW Let us look higher. END
BEGIN NOW If you set yourself to carry the heights of heaven, you must face God. END
BEGIN NOW The innumerable thoughts that surged through his brain might be summed up in these phrases. END
BEGIN NOW He grew calmer, and recovered something of his assurance as he watched the falling rain. END
BEGIN NOW He told himself that though he was about to squander two of the precious five-franc pieces that remained to him, the money was well laid out in preserving his coat, boots, and hat; and his cabman's cry of Gate, if you please, almost put him in spirits. END
BEGIN NOW A Swiss, in scarlet and gold, appeared, the great door groaned on its hinges, and Rastignac, with sweet satisfaction, beheld his equipage pass under the archway and stop before the flight of steps beneath the awning. END
BEGIN NOW The driver, in a blue-and-red greatcoat, dismounted and let down the step. END
BEGIN NOW As Eugene stepped out of the cab, he heard smothered laughter from the peristyle. END
BEGIN NOW Three or four lackeys were making merry over the festal appearance of the vehicle. END
BEGIN NOW In another moment the law student was enlightened as to the cause of their hilarity; he felt the full force of the contrast between his equipage and one of the smartest broughams in Paris; a coachman, with powdered hair, seemed to find it difficult to hold a pair of spirited horses, who stood chafing the bit. END
BEGIN NOW In de Restaud's courtyard, in the Chaussee d'Antin, he had seen the neat turnout of a young man of six-and-twenty; in the Faubourg Saint-Germain he found the luxurious equipage of a man of rank; thirty thousand francs would not have purchased it. END
BEGIN NOW Who can be here? END
BEGIN NOW said Eugene to himself. END
BEGIN NOW He began to understand, though somewhat tardily, that he must not expect to find many women in Paris who were not already appropriated, and that the capture of one of these queens would be likely to cost something more than bloodshed. END
BEGIN NOW Confound it all! END
BEGIN NOW I expect my cousin also has her Maxime. END
BEGIN NOW He went up the steps, feeling that he was a blighted being. END
BEGIN NOW The glass door was opened for him; the servants were as solemn as jackasses under the curry comb. END
BEGIN NOW So far, Eugene had only been in the ballroom on the ground floor of the Hotel Beauseant; the fete had followed so closely on the invitation, that he had not had time to call on his cousin, and had therefore never seen de Beauseant's apartments; he was about to behold for the first time a great lady among the wonderful and elegant surroundings that reveal her character and reflect her daily life. END
BEGIN NOW He was the more curious, because de Restaud's drawing-room had provided him with a standard of comparison. END
BEGIN NOW At half-past four the Vicomtesse de Beauseant was visible. END
BEGIN NOW Five minutes earlier she would not have received her cousin, but Eugene knew nothing of the recognized routine of various houses in Paris. END
BEGIN NOW He was conducted up the wide, white-painted, crimson-carpeted staircase, between the gilded balusters and masses of flowering plants, to de Beauseant's apartments. END
BEGIN NOW He did not know the rumor current about de Beauseant, one of the biographies told, with variations, in whispers, every evening in the salons of Paris. END
BEGIN NOW For three years past her name had been spoken of in connection with that of one of the most wealthy and distinguished Portuguese nobles, the Marquis d'Ajuda-Pinto. END
BEGIN NOW It was one of those innocent _liaisons_ which possess so much charm for the two thus attached to each other that they find the presence of a third person intolerable. END
BEGIN NOW The Vicomte de Beauseant, therefore, had himself set an example to the rest of the world by respecting, with as good a grace as might be, this morganatic union. END
BEGIN NOW Any one who came to call on the Vicomtesse in the early days of this friendship was sure to find the Marquis d'Ajuda-Pinto there. END
BEGIN NOW As, under the circumstances, de Beauseant could not very well shut her door against these visitors, she gave them such a cold reception, and showed so much interest in the study of the ceiling, that no one could fail to understand how much he bored her; and when it became known in Paris that de Beauseant was bored by callers between two and four o'clock, she was left in perfect solitude during that interval. END
BEGIN NOW She went to the Bouffons or to the Opera with M. de Beauseant and M. d'Ajuda-Pinto; and M. de Beauseant, like a well-bred man of the world, always left his wife and the Portuguese as soon as he had installed them. END
BEGIN NOW But M. d'Ajuda-Pinto must marry, and a Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW de Rochefide was the young lady. END
BEGIN NOW In the whole fashionable world there was but one person who as yet knew nothing of the arrangement, and that was de Beauseant. END
BEGIN NOW Some of her friends had hinted at the possibility, and she had laughed at them, believing that envy had prompted those ladies to try to make mischief. END
BEGIN NOW And now, though the bans were about to be published, and although the handsome Portuguese had come that day to break the news to the Vicomtesse, he had not found courage as yet to say one word about his treachery. END
BEGIN NOW How was it? END
BEGIN NOW Nothing is doubtless more difficult than the notification of an ultimatum of this kind. END
BEGIN NOW There are men who feel more at their ease when they stand up before another man who threatens their lives with sword or pistol than in the presence of a woman who, after two hours of lamentations and reproaches, falls into a dead swoon and requires salts. END
BEGIN NOW At this moment, therefore, M. d'Ajuda-Pinto was on thorns, and anxious to take his leave. END
BEGIN NOW He told himself that in some way or other the news would reach de Beauseant; he would write, it would be much better to do it by letter, and not to utter the words that should stab her to the heart. END
BEGIN NOW So when the servant announced M. Eugene de Rastignac, the Marquis d'Ajuda-Pinto trembled with joy. END
BEGIN NOW To be sure, a loving woman shows even more ingenuity in inventing doubts of her lover than in varying the monotony of his happiness; and when she is about to be forsaken, she instinctively interprets every gesture as rapidly as Virgil's courser detected the presence of his companion by snuffing the breeze. END
BEGIN NOW It was impossible, therefore, that de Beauseant should not detect that involuntary thrill of satisfaction; slight though it was, it was appalling in its artlessness. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene had yet to learn that no one in Paris should present himself in any house without first making himself acquainted with the whole history of its owner, and of its owner's wife and family, so that he may avoid making any of the terrible blunders which in Poland draw forth the picturesque exclamation, Harness five bullocks to your cart! END
BEGIN NOW probably because you will need them all to pull you out of the quagmire into which a false step has plunged you. END
BEGIN NOW If, down to the present day, our language has no name for these conversational disasters, it is probably because they are believed to be impossible, the publicity given in Paris to every scandal is so prodigious. END
BEGIN NOW After the awkward incident at de Restaud's, no one but Eugene could have reappeared in his character of bullock-driver in de Beauseant's drawing-room. END
BEGIN NOW But if de Restaud and M. de Trailles had found him horribly in the way, M. d'Ajuda hailed his coming with relief. END
BEGIN NOW Good-bye, said the Portuguese, hurrying to the door, as Eugene made his entrance into a dainty little pink-and-gray drawing-room, where luxury seemed nothing more than good taste. END
BEGIN NOW Until this evening, said de Beauseant, turning her head to give the Marquis a glance. END
BEGIN NOW We are going to the Bouffons, are we not? END
BEGIN NOW I cannot go, he said, with his fingers on the door handle. END
BEGIN NOW de Beauseant rose and beckoned to him to return. END
BEGIN NOW She did not pay the slightest attention to Eugene, who stood there dazzled by the sparkling marvels around him; he began to think that this was some story out of the Arabian Nights made real, and did not know where to hide himself, when the woman before him seemed to be unconscious of his existence. END
BEGIN NOW The Vicomtesse had raised the forefinger of her right hand, and gracefully signed to the Marquis to seat himself beside her. END
BEGIN NOW The Marquis felt the imperious sway of passion in her gesture; he came back towards her. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene watched him, not without a feeling of envy. END
BEGIN NOW That is the owner of the brougham! END
BEGIN NOW he said to himself. END
BEGIN NOW But is it necessary to have a pair of spirited horses, servants in livery, and torrents of gold to draw a glance from a woman here in Paris? END
BEGIN NOW The demon of luxury gnawed at his heart, greed burned in his veins, his throat was parched with the thirst of gold. END
BEGIN NOW He had a hundred and thirty francs every quarter. END
BEGIN NOW His father, mother, brothers, sisters, and aunt did not spend two hundred francs a month among them. END
BEGIN NOW This swift comparison between his present condition and the aims he had in view helped to benumb his faculties. END
BEGIN NOW Why not? END
BEGIN NOW the Vicomtesse was saying, as she smiled at the Portuguese. END
BEGIN NOW Why cannot you come to the Italiens? END
BEGIN NOW Affairs! END
BEGIN NOW I am to dine with the English Ambassador. END
BEGIN NOW Throw him over. END
BEGIN NOW When a man once enters on a course of deception, he is compelled to add lie to lie. END
BEGIN NOW M. d'Ajuda therefore said, smiling, Do you lay your commands on me? END
BEGIN NOW Yes, certainly. END
BEGIN NOW That was what I wanted to have you say to me, he answered, dissembling his feelings in a glance which would have reassured any other woman. END
BEGIN NOW He took the Vicomtesse's hand, kissed it, and went. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene ran his fingers through his hair, and constrained himself to bow. END
BEGIN NOW He thought that now de Beauseant would give him her attention; but suddenly she sprang forward, rushed to a window in the gallery, and watched M. d'Ajuda step into his carriage; she listened to the order that he gave, and heard the Swiss repeat it to the coachman: To M. de Rochefide's house. END
BEGIN NOW Those words, and the way in which M. d'Ajuda flung himself back in the carriage, were like a lightning flash and a thunderbolt for her; she walked back again with a deadly fear gnawing at her heart. END
BEGIN NOW The most terrible catastrophes only happen among the heights. END
BEGIN NOW The Vicomtesse went to her own room, sat down at a table, and took up a sheet of dainty notepaper. END
BEGIN NOW When, instead of dining with the English Ambassador, she wrote, you go to the Rochefides, you owe me an explanation, which I am waiting to hear. END
BEGIN NOW She retraced several of the letters, for her hand was trembling so that they were indistinct; then she signed the note with an initial C for Claire de Bourgogne, and rang the bell. END
BEGIN NOW Jacques, she said to the servant, who appeared immediately, take this note to M. de Rochefide's house at half-past seven and ask for the Marquis d'Ajuda. END
BEGIN NOW If M. d'Ajuda is there, leave the note without waiting for an answer; if he is not there, bring the note back to me. END
BEGIN NOW Madame la Vicomtess, there is a visitor in the drawing-room. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW yes, of course, she said, opening the door. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene was beginning to feel very uncomfortable, but at last the Vicomtesse appeared; she spoke to him, and the tremulous tones of her voice vibrated through his heart. END
BEGIN NOW Pardon me, monsieur, she said; I had a letter to write. END
BEGIN NOW Now I am quite at liberty. END
BEGIN NOW She scarcely knew what she was saying, for even as she spoke she thought, Ah! END
BEGIN NOW he means to marry Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW de Rochefide? END
BEGIN NOW But is he still free? END
BEGIN NOW This evening the marriage shall be broken off, or else... END
BEGIN NOW But before to-morrow I shall know. END
BEGIN NOW Cousin... the student replied. END
BEGIN NOW Eh? END
BEGIN NOW said the Countess, with an insolent glance that sent a cold shudder through Eugene; he understood what that Eh? END
BEGIN NOW meant; he had learned a great deal in three hours, and his wits were on the alert. END
BEGIN NOW He reddened: Madame... he began; he hesitated a moment, and then went on. END
BEGIN NOW Pardon me; I am in such need of protection that the nearest scrap of relationship could do me no harm. END
BEGIN NOW de Beauseant smiled but there was sadness in her smile; even now she felt forebodings of the coming pain, the air she breathed was heavy with the storm that was about to burst. END
BEGIN NOW If you knew how my family are situated, he went on, you would love to play the part of a beneficent fairy godmother who graciously clears the obstacles from the path of her protege. END
BEGIN NOW Well, cousin, she said, laughing, and how can I be of service to you? END
BEGIN NOW But do I know even that? END
BEGIN NOW I am distantly related to you, and this obscure and remote relationship is even now a perfect godsend to me. END
BEGIN NOW You have confused my ideas; I cannot remember the things that I meant to say to you. END
BEGIN NOW I know no one else here in Paris.... Ah! END
BEGIN NOW if I could only ask you to counsel me, ask you to look upon me as a poor child who would fain cling to the hem of your dress, who would lay down his life for you. END
BEGIN NOW Would you kill a man for me? END
BEGIN NOW Two, said Eugene. END
BEGIN NOW You, child. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, you are a child, she said, keeping back the tears that came to her eyes; you would love sincerely. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW he cried, flinging up his head. END
BEGIN NOW The audacity of the student's answer interested the Vicomtesse in him. END
BEGIN NOW The southern brain was beginning to scheme for the first time. END
BEGIN NOW Between de Restaud's blue boudoir and de Beauseant's rose-colored drawing-room he had made a three years' advance in a kind of law which is not a recognized study in Paris, although it is a sort of higher jurisprudence, and, when well understood, is a highroad to success of every kind. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW that is what I meant to say! END
BEGIN NOW said Eugene. END
BEGIN NOW I met de Restaud at your ball, and this morning I went to see her. END
BEGIN NOW You must have been very much in the way, said de Beauseant, smiling as she spoke. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, indeed. END
BEGIN NOW I am a novice, and my blunders will set every one against me, if you do not give me your counsel. END
BEGIN NOW I believe that in Paris it is very difficult to meet with a young, beautiful, and wealthy woman of fashion who would be willing to teach me, what you women can explain so well&mdash;life. END
BEGIN NOW I shall find a M. de Trailles everywhere. END
BEGIN NOW So I have come to you to ask you to give me a key to a puzzle, to entreat you to tell me what sort of blunder I made this morning. END
BEGIN NOW I mentioned an old man&mdash;- Madame la Duchess de Langeais, Jacques cut the student short; Eugene gave expression to his intense annoyance by a gesture. END
BEGIN NOW If you mean to succeed, said the Vicomtesse in a low voice, in the first place you must not be so demonstrative. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW good morning, dear, she continued, and rising and crossing the room, she grasped the Duchess' hands as affectionately as if they had been sisters; the Duchess responded in the prettiest and most gracious way. END
BEGIN NOW Two intimate friends! END
BEGIN NOW said Rastignac to himself. END
BEGIN NOW Henceforward I shall have two protectresses; those two women are great friends, no doubt, and this newcomer will doubtless interest herself in her friend's cousin. END
BEGIN NOW To what happy inspiration do I owe this piece of good fortune, dear Antoinette? END
BEGIN NOW asked de Beauseant. END
BEGIN NOW Well, I saw M. d'Ajuda-Pinto at M. de Rochefide's door, so I thought that if I came I should find you alone. END
BEGIN NOW de Beauseant's mouth did not tighten, her color did not rise, her expression did not alter, or rather, her brow seemed to clear as the Duchess uttered those deadly words. END
BEGIN NOW If I had known that you were engaged&mdash;- the speaker added, glancing at Eugene. END
BEGIN NOW This gentleman is M. Eugene de Rastignac, one of my cousins, said the Vicomtesse. END
BEGIN NOW Have you any news of General de Montriveau? END
BEGIN NOW she continued. END
BEGIN NOW Serizy told me yesterday that he never goes anywhere now; has he been to see you to-day? END
BEGIN NOW It was believed that the Duchess was desperately in love with M. de Montriveau, and that he was a faithless lover; she felt the question in her very heart, and her face flushed as she answered: He was at the Elysee yesterday. END
BEGIN NOW In attendance? END
BEGIN NOW Claire, returned the Duchess, and hatred overflowed in the glances she threw at de Beauseant; of course you know that M. d'Ajuda-Pinto is going to marry Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW de Rochefide; the bans will be published to-morrow. END
BEGIN NOW This thrust was too cruel; the Vicomtesse's face grew white, but she answered, laughing, One of those rumors that fools amuse themselves with. END
BEGIN NOW What should induce M. d'Ajuda to take one of the noblest names in Portugal to the Rochefides? END
BEGIN NOW The Rochefides were only ennobled yesterday. END
BEGIN NOW But Bertha will have two hundred thousand livres a year, they say. END
BEGIN NOW M. d'Ajuda is too wealthy to marry for money. END
BEGIN NOW But, my dear, Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW de Rochefide is a charming girl. END
BEGIN NOW Indeed? END
BEGIN NOW And, as a matter of fact, he is dining with them to-day; the thing is settled. END
BEGIN NOW It is very surprising to me that you should know so little about it. END
BEGIN NOW de Beauseant turned to Rastignac. END
BEGIN NOW What was the blunder that you made, monsieur? END
BEGIN NOW she asked. END
BEGIN NOW The poor boy is only just launched into the world, Antoinette, so that he understands nothing of all this that we are speaking of. END
BEGIN NOW Be merciful to him, and let us finish our talk to-morrow. END
BEGIN NOW Everything will be announced to-morrow, you know, and your kind informal communication can be accompanied by official confirmation. END
BEGIN NOW The Duchess gave Eugene one of those insolent glances that measure a man from head to foot, and leave him crushed and annihilated. END
BEGIN NOW Madame, I have unwittingly plunged a dagger into de Restaud's heart; unwittingly&mdash;therein lies my offence, said the student of law, whose keen brain had served him sufficiently well, for he had detected the biting epigrams that lurked beneath this friendly talk. END
BEGIN NOW You continue to receive, possibly you fear, those who know the amount of pain that they deliberately inflict; but a clumsy blunderer who has no idea how deeply he wounds is looked upon as a fool who does not know how to make use of his opportunities, and every one despises him. END
BEGIN NOW de Beauseant gave the student a glance, one of those glances in which a great soul can mingle dignity and gratitude. END
BEGIN NOW It was like balm to the law student, who was still smarting under the Duchess' insolent scrutiny; she had looked at him as an auctioneer might look at some article to appraise its value. END
BEGIN NOW Imagine, too, that I had just made some progress with the Comte de Restaud; for I should tell you, madame, he went on, turning to the Duchess with a mixture of humility and malice in his manner, that as yet I am only a poor devil of a student, very much alone in the world, and very poor&mdash;- You should not tell us that, M. de Rastignac. END
BEGIN NOW We women never care about anything that no one else will take. END
BEGIN NOW Bah! END
BEGIN NOW said Eugene. END
BEGIN NOW I am only two-and-twenty, and I must make up my mind to the drawbacks of my time of life. END
BEGIN NOW Besides, I am confessing my sins, and it would be impossible to kneel in a more charming confessional; you commit your sins in one drawing-room, and receive absolution for them in another. END
BEGIN NOW The Duchess' expression grew colder, she did not like the flippant tone of these remarks, and showed that she considered them to be in bad taste by turning to the Vicomtesse with&mdash; This gentleman has only just come&mdash;- de Beauseant began to laugh outright at her cousin and at the Duchess both. END
BEGIN NOW He has only just come to Paris, dear, and is in search of some one who will give him lessons in good taste. END
BEGIN NOW la Duchesse, said Eugene, is it not natural to wish to be initiated into the mysteries which charm us? END
BEGIN NOW ( Come, now, he said to himself, my language is superfinely elegant, I'm sure. ) END
BEGIN NOW But de Restaud is herself, I believe, M. de Trailles' pupil, said the Duchess. END
BEGIN NOW Of that I had no idea, madame, answered the law student, so I rashly came between them. END
BEGIN NOW In fact, I got on very well with the lady's husband, and his wife tolerated me for a time until I took it into my head to tell them that I knew some one of whom I had just caught a glimpse as he went out by a back staircase, a man who had given the Countess a kiss at the end of a passage. END
BEGIN NOW Who was it? END
BEGIN NOW both women asked together. END
BEGIN NOW An old man who lives at the rate of two louis a month in the Faubourg Saint-Marceau, where I, a poor student, lodge likewise. END
BEGIN NOW He is a truly unfortunate creature, everybody laughs at him&mdash;we all call him 'Father Goriot.' END
BEGIN NOW Why, child that you are, cried the Vicomtesse, de Restaud was a Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Goriot! END
BEGIN NOW The daughter of a vermicelli manufacturer, the Duchess added; and when the little creature went to Court, the daughter of a pastry-cook was presented on the same day. END
BEGIN NOW Do you remember, Claire? END
BEGIN NOW The King began to laugh, and made some joke in Latin about flour. END
BEGIN NOW People&mdash;what was it?&mdash;people&mdash;- _Ejusdem farinoe_, said Eugene. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, that was it, said the Duchess. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW is that her father? END
BEGIN NOW the law student continued, aghast. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, certainly; the old man had two daughters; he dotes on them, so to speak, though they will scarcely acknowledge him. END
BEGIN NOW Didn't the second daughter marry a banker with a German name? END
BEGIN NOW the Vicomtesse asked, turning to de Langeais, a Baron de Nucingen? END
BEGIN NOW And her name is Delphine, is it not? END
BEGIN NOW Isn't she a fair-haired woman who has a side-box at the Opera? END
BEGIN NOW She comes sometimes to the Bouffons, and laughs loudly to attract attention. END
BEGIN NOW The Duchess smiled and said: I wonder at you, dear. END
BEGIN NOW Why do you take so much interest in people of that kind? END
BEGIN NOW One must have been as madly in love as Restaud was, to be infatuated with Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Anastasie and her flour sacks. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW he will not find her a good bargain! END
BEGIN NOW She is in M. de Trailles' hands, and he will ruin her. END
BEGIN NOW And they do not acknowledge their father! END
BEGIN NOW Eugene repeated. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW well, yes, their father, the father, a father, replied the Vicomtesse, a kind father who gave them each five or six hundred thousand francs, it is said, to secure their happiness by marrying them well; while he only kept eight or ten thousand livres a year for himself, thinking that his daughters would always be his daughters, thinking that in them he would live his life twice over again, that in their houses he should find two homes, where he would be loved and looked up to, and made much of. END
BEGIN NOW And in two years' time both his sons-in-law had turned him out of their houses as if he were one of the lowest outcasts. END
BEGIN NOW Tears came into Eugene's eyes. END
BEGIN NOW He was still under the spell of youthful beliefs, he had just left home, pure and sacred feelings had been stirred within him, and this was his first day on the battlefield of civilization in Paris. END
BEGIN NOW Genuine feeling is so infectious that for a moment the three looked at each other in silence. END
BEGIN NOW _Eh, mon Dieu!_ said de Langeais; yes, it seems very horrible, and yet we see such things every day. END
BEGIN NOW Is there not a reason for it? END
BEGIN NOW Tell me, dear, have you ever really thought what a son-in-law is? END
BEGIN NOW A son-in-law is the man for whom we bring up, you and I, a dear little one, bound to us very closely in innumerable ways; for seventeen years she will be the joy of her family, its 'white soul,' as Lamartine says, and suddenly she will become its scourge. END
BEGIN NOW When HE comes and takes her from us, his love from the very beginning is like an axe laid to the root of all the old affection in our darling's heart, and all the ties that bound her to her family are severed. END
BEGIN NOW But yesterday our little daughter thought of no one but her mother and father, as we had no thought that was not for her; by to-morrow she will have become a hostile stranger. END
BEGIN NOW The tragedy is always going on under our eyes. END
BEGIN NOW On the one hand you see a father who has sacrificed himself to his son, and his daughter-in-law shows him the last degree of insolence. END
BEGIN NOW On the other hand, it is the son-in-law who turns his wife's mother out of the house. END
BEGIN NOW I sometimes hear it said that there is nothing dramatic about society in these days; but the Drama of the Son-in-law is appalling, to say nothing of our marriages, which have come to be very poor farces. END
BEGIN NOW I can explain how it all came about in the old vermicelli maker's case. END
BEGIN NOW I think I recollect that Foriot&mdash;- Goriot, madame. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, that Moriot was once President of his Section during the Revolution. END
BEGIN NOW He was in the secret of the famous scarcity of grain, and laid the foundation of his fortune in those days by selling flour for ten times its cost. END
BEGIN NOW He had as much flour as he wanted. END
BEGIN NOW My grandmother's steward sold him immense quantities. END
BEGIN NOW No doubt Noriot shared the plunder with the Committee of Public Salvation, as that sort of person always did. END
BEGIN NOW I recollect the steward telling my grandmother that she might live at Grandvilliers in complete security, because her corn was as good as a certificate of civism. END
BEGIN NOW Well, then, this Loriot, who sold corn to those butchers, has never had but one passion, they say&mdash;he idolizes his daughters. END
BEGIN NOW He settled one of them under Restaud's roof, and grafted the other into the Nucingen family tree, the Baron de Nucingen being a rich banker who had turned Royalist. END
BEGIN NOW You can quite understand that so long as Bonaparte was Emperor, the two sons-in-law could manage to put up with the old Ninety-three; but after the restoration of the Bourbons, M. de Restaud felt bored by the old man's society, and the banker was still more tired of it. END
BEGIN NOW His daughters were still fond of him; they wanted 'to keep the goat and the cabbage,' so they used to see Joriot whenever there was no one there, under pretence of affection. END
BEGIN NOW 'Come to-day, papa, we shall have you all to ourselves, and that will be much nicer!' END
BEGIN NOW and all that sort of thing. END
BEGIN NOW As for me, dear, I believe that love has second-sight: poor Ninety-three; his heart must have bled. END
BEGIN NOW He saw that his daughters were ashamed of him, that if they loved their husbands his visits must make mischief. END
BEGIN NOW So he immolated himself. END
BEGIN NOW He made the sacrifice because he was a father; he went into voluntary exile. END
BEGIN NOW His daughters were satisfied, so he thought that he had done the best thing he could; but it was a family crime, and father and daughters were accomplices. END
BEGIN NOW You see this sort of thing everywhere. END
BEGIN NOW What could this old Doriot have been but a splash of mud in his daughters' drawing-rooms? END
BEGIN NOW He would only have been in the way, and bored other people, besides being bored himself. END
BEGIN NOW And this that happened between father and daughters may happen to the prettiest woman in Paris and the man she loves the best; if her love grows tiresome, he will go; he will descend to the basest trickery to leave her. END
BEGIN NOW It is the same with all love and friendship. END
BEGIN NOW Our heart is a treasury; if you pour out all its wealth at once, you are bankrupt. END
BEGIN NOW We show no more mercy to the affection that reveals its utmost extent than we do to another kind of prodigal who has not a penny left. END
BEGIN NOW Their father had given them all he had. END
BEGIN NOW For twenty years he had given his whole heart to them; then, one day, he gave them all his fortune too. END
BEGIN NOW The lemon was squeezed; the girls left the rest in the gutter. END
BEGIN NOW The world is very base, said the Vicomtesse, plucking at the threads of her shawl. END
BEGIN NOW She did not raise her head as she spoke; the words that de Langeais had meant for her in the course of her story had cut her to the quick. END
BEGIN NOW Base? END
BEGIN NOW Oh, no, answered the Duchess; the world goes its own way, that is all. END
BEGIN NOW If I speak in this way, it is only to show that I am not duped by it. END
BEGIN NOW I think as you do, she said, pressing the Vicomtesse's hand. END
BEGIN NOW The world is a slough; let us try to live on the heights above it. END
BEGIN NOW She rose to her feet and kissed de Beauseant on the forehead as she said: You look very charming to-day, dear. END
BEGIN NOW I have never seen such a lovely color in your cheeks before. END
BEGIN NOW Then she went out with a slight inclination of the head to the cousin. END
BEGIN NOW Father Goriot is sublime! END
BEGIN NOW said Eugene to himself, as he remembered how he had watched his neighbor work the silver vessel into a shapeless mass that night. END
BEGIN NOW de Beauseant did not hear him; she was absorbed in her own thoughts. END
BEGIN NOW For several minutes the silence remained unbroken till the law student became almost paralyzed with embarrassment, and was equally afraid to go or stay or speak a word. END
BEGIN NOW The world is basely ungrateful and ill-natured, said the Vicomtesse at last. END
BEGIN NOW No sooner does a trouble befall you than a friend is ready to bring the tidings and to probe your heart with the point of a dagger while calling on you to admire the handle. END
BEGIN NOW Epigrams and sarcasms already! END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW I will defend myself! END
BEGIN NOW She raised her head like the great lady that she was, and lightnings flashed from her proud eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW she said, as she saw Eugene, are you there? END
BEGIN NOW Still, he said piteously. END
BEGIN NOW Well, then, M. de Rastignac, deal with the world as it deserves. END
BEGIN NOW You are determined to succeed? END
BEGIN NOW I will help you. END
BEGIN NOW You shall sound the depths of corruption in woman; you shall measure the extent of man's pitiful vanity. END
BEGIN NOW Deeply as I am versed in such learning, there were pages in the book of life that I had not read. END
BEGIN NOW Now I know all. END
BEGIN NOW The more cold-blooded your calculations, the further you will go. END
BEGIN NOW Strike ruthlessly; you will be feared. END
BEGIN NOW Men and women for you must be nothing more than post-horses; take a fresh relay, and leave the last to drop by the roadside; in this way you will reach the goal of your ambition. END
BEGIN NOW You will be nothing here, you see, unless a woman interests herself in you; and she must be young and wealthy, and a woman of the world. END
BEGIN NOW Yet, if you have a heart, lock it carefully away like a treasure; do not let any one suspect it, or you will be lost; you would cease to be the executioner, you would take the victim's place. END
BEGIN NOW And if ever you should love, never let your secret escape you! END
BEGIN NOW Trust no one until you are very sure of the heart to which you open your heart. END
BEGIN NOW Learn to mistrust every one; take every precaution for the sake of the love which does not exist as yet. END
BEGIN NOW Listen, Miguel &mdash;the name slipped from her so naturally that she did not notice her mistake&mdash; there is something still more appalling than the ingratitude of daughters who have cast off their old father and wish that he were dead, and that is a rivalry between two sisters. END
BEGIN NOW Restaud comes of a good family, his wife has been received into their circle; she has been presented at court; and her sister, her wealthy sister, Delphine de Nucingen, the wife of a great capitalist, is consumed with envy, and ready to die of spleen. END
BEGIN NOW There is gulf set between the sisters&mdash;indeed, they are sisters no longer&mdash;the two women who refuse to acknowledge their father do not acknowledge each other. END
BEGIN NOW So de Nucingen would lap up all the mud that lies between the Rue Saint-Lazare and the Rue de Grenelle to gain admittance to my salon. END
BEGIN NOW She fancied that she should gain her end through de Marsay; she has made herself de Marsay's slave, and she bores him. END
BEGIN NOW De Marsay cares very little about her. END
BEGIN NOW If you will introduce her to me, you will be her darling, her Benjamin; she will idolize you. END
BEGIN NOW If, after that, you can love her, do so; if not, make her useful. END
BEGIN NOW I will ask her to come once or twice to one of my great crushes, but I will never receive her here in the morning. END
BEGIN NOW I will bow to her when I see her, and that will be quite sufficient. END
BEGIN NOW You have shut the Comtesse de Restaud's door against you by mentioning Father Goriot's name. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, my good friend, you may call at her house twenty times, and every time out of the twenty you will find that she is not at home. END
BEGIN NOW The servants have their orders, and will not admit you. END
BEGIN NOW Very well, then, now let Father Goriot gain the right of entry into her sister's house for you. END
BEGIN NOW The beautiful de Nucingen will give the signal for a battle. END
BEGIN NOW As soon as she singles you out, other women will begin to lose their heads about you, and her enemies and rivals and intimate friends will all try to take you from her. END
BEGIN NOW There are women who will fall in love with a man because another woman has chosen him; like the city madams, poor things, who copy our millinery, and hope thereby to acquire our manners. END
BEGIN NOW You will have a success, and in Paris success is everything; it is the key of power. END
BEGIN NOW If the women credit you with wit and talent, the men will follow suit so long as you do not undeceive them yourself. END
BEGIN NOW There will be nothing you may not aspire to; you will go everywhere, and you will find out what the world is&mdash;an assemblage of fools and knaves. END
BEGIN NOW But you must be neither the one nor the other. END
BEGIN NOW I am giving you my name like Ariadne's clue of thread to take with you into the labyrinth; make no unworthy use of it, she said, with a queenly glance and curve of her throat; give it back to me unsullied. END
BEGIN NOW And now, go; leave me. END
BEGIN NOW We women also have our battles to fight. END
BEGIN NOW And if you should ever need some one who would gladly set a match to a train for you&mdash;- Well? END
BEGIN NOW she asked. END
BEGIN NOW He tapped his heart, smiled in answer to his cousin's smile, and went. END
BEGIN NOW It was five o'clock, and Eugene was hungry; he was afraid lest he should not be in time for dinner, a misgiving which made him feel that it was pleasant to be borne so quickly across Paris. END
BEGIN NOW This sensation of physical comfort left his mind free to grapple with the thoughts that assailed him. END
BEGIN NOW A mortification usually sends a young man of his age into a furious rage; he shakes his fist at society, and vows vengeance when his belief in himself is shaken. END
BEGIN NOW Just then Rastignac was overwhelmed by the words, You have shut the Countess' door against you. END
BEGIN NOW I shall call! END
BEGIN NOW he said to himself, and if de Beauseant is right, if I never find her at home&mdash;I... well, de Restaud shall meet me in every salon in Paris. END
BEGIN NOW I will learn to fence and have some pistol practice, and kill that Maxime of hers! END
BEGIN NOW And money? END
BEGIN NOW cried an inward monitor. END
BEGIN NOW How about money, where is that to come from? END
BEGIN NOW And all at once the wealth displayed in the Countess de Restaud's drawing-room rose before his eyes. END
BEGIN NOW That was the luxury which Goriot's daughter had loved too well, the gilding, the ostentatious splendor, the unintelligent luxury of the parvenu, the riotous extravagance of a courtesan. END
BEGIN NOW Then the attractive vision suddenly went under an eclipse as he remembered the stately grandeur of the Hotel de Beauseant. END
BEGIN NOW As his fancy wandered among these lofty regions in the great world of Paris, innumerable dark thoughts gathered in his heart; his ideas widened, and his conscience grew more elastic. END
BEGIN NOW He saw the world as it is; saw how the rich lived beyond the jurisdiction of law and public opinion, and found in success the _ultima ratio mundi_. END
BEGIN NOW Vautrin is right, success is virtue! END
BEGIN NOW he said to himself. END
BEGIN NOW Arrived in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve, he rushed up to his room for ten francs wherewith to satisfy the demands of the cabman, and went in to dinner. END
BEGIN NOW He glanced round the squalid room, saw the eighteen poverty-stricken creatures about to feed like cattle in their stalls, and the sight filled him with loathing. END
BEGIN NOW The transition was too sudden, and the contrast was so violent that it could not but act as a powerful stimulant; his ambition developed and grew beyond all social bounds. END
BEGIN NOW On the one hand, he beheld a vision of social life in its most charming and refined forms, of quick-pulsed youth, of fair, impassioned faces invested with all the charm of poetry, framed in a marvelous setting of luxury or art; and, on the other hand, he saw a sombre picture, the miry verge beyond these faces, in which passion was extinct and nothing was left of the drama but the cords and pulleys and bare mechanism. END
BEGIN NOW de Beauseant's counsels, the words uttered in anger by the forsaken lady, her petulant offer, came to his mind, and poverty was a ready expositor. END
BEGIN NOW Rastignac determined to open two parallel trenches so as to insure success; he would be a learned doctor of law and a man of fashion. END
BEGIN NOW Clearly he was still a child! END
BEGIN NOW Those two lines are asymptotes, and will never meet. END
BEGIN NOW You are very dull, my lord Marquis, said Vautrin, with one of the shrewd glances that seem to read the innermost secrets of another mind. END
BEGIN NOW I am not in the humor to stand jokes from people who call me 'my lord Marquis,' answered Eugene. END
BEGIN NOW A marquis here in Paris, if he is not the veriest sham, ought to have a hundred thousand livres a year at least; and a lodger in the Maison Vauquer is not exactly Fortune's favorite. END
BEGIN NOW Vautrin's glance at Rastignac was half-paternal, half-contemptuous. END
BEGIN NOW Puppy! END
BEGIN NOW it seemed to say; I should make one mouthful of him! END
BEGIN NOW Then he answered: You are in a bad humor; perhaps your visit to the beautiful Comtesse de Restaud was not a success. END
BEGIN NOW She has shut her door against me because I told her that her father dined at our table, cried Rastignac. END
BEGIN NOW Glances were exchanged all round the room; Father Goriot looked down. END
BEGIN NOW You have sent some snuff into my eye, he said to his neighbor, turning a little aside to rub his hand over his face. END
BEGIN NOW Any one who molests Father Goriot will have henceforward to reckon with me, said Eugene, looking at the old man's neighbor; he is worth all the rest of us put together.&mdash;I am not speaking of the ladies, he added, turning in the direction of Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Taillefer. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene's remarks produced a sensation, and his tone silenced the dinner-table. END
BEGIN NOW Vautrin alone spoke. END
BEGIN NOW If you are going to champion Father Goriot, and set up for his responsible editor into the bargain, you had need be a crack shot and know how to handle the foils, he said, banteringly. END
BEGIN NOW So I intend, said Eugene. END
BEGIN NOW Then you are taking the field to-day? END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps, Rastignac answered. END
BEGIN NOW But I owe no account of myself to any one, especially as I do not try to find out what other people do of a night. END
BEGIN NOW Vautrin looked askance at Rastignac. END
BEGIN NOW If you do not mean to be deceived by the puppets, my boy, you must go behind and see the whole show, and not peep through holes in the curtain. END
BEGIN NOW That is enough, he added, seeing that Eugene was about to fly into a passion. END
BEGIN NOW We can have a little talk whenever you like. END
BEGIN NOW There was a general feeling of gloom and constraint. END
BEGIN NOW Father Goriot was so deeply dejected by the student's remark that he did not notice the change in the disposition of his fellow-lodgers, nor know that he had met with a champion capable of putting an end to the persecution. END
BEGIN NOW Then, M. Goriot sitting there is the father of a countess, said Vauquer in a low voice. END
BEGIN NOW And of a baroness, answered Rastignac. END
BEGIN NOW That is about all he is capable of, said Bianchon to Rastignac; I have taken a look at his head; there is only one bump&mdash;the bump of Paternity; he must be an _eternal father_. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene was too intent on his thoughts to laugh at Bianchon's joke. END
BEGIN NOW He determined to profit by de Beauseant's counsels, and was asking himself how he could obtain the necessary money. END
BEGIN NOW He grew grave. END
BEGIN NOW The wide savannas of the world stretched before his eyes; all things lay before him, nothing was his. END
BEGIN NOW Dinner came to an end, the others went, and he was left in the dining-room. END
BEGIN NOW So you have seen my daughter? END
BEGIN NOW Goriot spoke tremulously, and the sound of his voice broke in upon Eugene's dreams. END
BEGIN NOW The young man took the elder's hand, and looked at him with something like kindness in his eyes. END
BEGIN NOW You are a good and noble man, he said. END
BEGIN NOW We will have some talk about your daughters by and by. END
BEGIN NOW He rose without waiting for Goriot's answer, and went to his room. END
BEGIN NOW There he wrote the following letter to his mother:&mdash; My Dear Mother,&mdash;Can you nourish your child from your breast again? END
BEGIN NOW I am in a position to make a rapid fortune, but I want twelve hundred francs&mdash;I must have them at all costs. END
BEGIN NOW Say nothing about this to my father; perhaps he might make objections, and unless I have the money, I may be led to put an end to myself, and so escape the clutches of despair. END
BEGIN NOW I will tell you everything when I see you. END
BEGIN NOW I will not begin to try to describe my present situation; it would take volumes to put the whole story clearly and fully. END
BEGIN NOW I have not been gambling, my kind mother, I owe no one a penny; but if you would preserve the life that you gave me, you must send me the sum I mention. END
BEGIN NOW As a matter of fact, I go to see the Vicomtesse de Beauseant; she is using her influence for me; I am obliged to go into society, and I have not a penny to lay out on clean gloves. END
BEGIN NOW I can manage to exist on bread and water, or go without food, if need be, but I cannot do without the tools with which they cultivate the vineyards in this country. END
BEGIN NOW I must resolutely make up my mind at once to make my way, or stick in the mire for the rest of my days. END
BEGIN NOW I know that all your hopes are set on me, and I want to realize them quickly. END
BEGIN NOW Sell some of your old jewelry, my kind mother; I will give you other jewels very soon. END
BEGIN NOW I know enough of our affairs at home to know all that such a sacrifice means, and you must not think that I would lightly ask you to make it; I should be a monster if I could. END
BEGIN NOW You must think of my entreaty as a cry forced from me by imperative necessity. END
BEGIN NOW Our whole future lies in the subsidy with which I must begin my first campaign, for life in Paris is one continual battle. END
BEGIN NOW If you cannot otherwise procure the whole of the money, and are forced to sell our aunt's lace, tell her that I will send her some still handsomer, and so forth. END
BEGIN NOW He wrote to ask each of his sisters for their savings&mdash;would they despoil themselves for him, and keep the sacrifice a secret from the family? END
BEGIN NOW To his request he knew that they would not fail to respond gladly, and he added to it an appeal to their delicacy by touching the chord of honor that vibrates so loudly in young and high-strung natures. END
BEGIN NOW Yet when he had written the letters, he could not help feeling misgivings in spite of his youthful ambition; his heart beat fast, and he trembled. END
BEGIN NOW He knew the spotless nobleness of the lives buried away in the lonely manor house; he knew what trouble and what joy his request would cause his sisters, and how happy they would be as they talked at the bottom of the orchard of that dear brother of theirs in Paris. END
BEGIN NOW Visions rose before his eyes; a sudden strong light revealed his sisters secretly counting over their little store, devising some girlish stratagem by which the money could be sent to him _incognito_, essaying, for the first time in their lives, a piece of deceit that reached the sublime in its unselfishness. END
BEGIN NOW A sister's heart is a diamond for purity, a deep sea of tenderness! END
BEGIN NOW he said to himself. END
BEGIN NOW He felt ashamed of those letters. END
BEGIN NOW What power there must be in the petitions put up by such hearts; how pure the fervor that bears their souls to Heaven in prayer! END
BEGIN NOW What exquisite joy they would find in self-sacrifice! END
BEGIN NOW What a pang for his mother's heart if she could not send him all that he asked for! END
BEGIN NOW And this noble affection, these sacrifices made at such terrible cost, were to serve as the ladder by which he meant to climb to Delphine de Nucingen. END
BEGIN NOW A few tears, like the last grains of incense flung upon the sacred alter fire of the hearth, fell from his eyes. END
BEGIN NOW He walked up and down, and despair mingled with his emotion. END
BEGIN NOW Father Goriot saw him through the half-open door. END
BEGIN NOW What is the matter, sir? END
BEGIN NOW he asked from the threshold. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW my good neighbor, I am as much a son and brother as you are a father. END
BEGIN NOW You do well to fear for the Comtesse Anastasie; there is one M. Maxime de Trailles, who will be her ruin. END
BEGIN NOW Father Goriot withdrew, stammering some words, but Eugene failed to catch their meaning. END
BEGIN NOW The next morning Rastignac went out to post his letters. END
BEGIN NOW Up to the last moment he wavered and doubted, but he ended by flinging them into the box. END
BEGIN NOW I shall succeed! END
BEGIN NOW he said to himself. END
BEGIN NOW So says the gambler; so says the great captain; but the three words that have been the salvation of some few, have been the ruin of many more. END
BEGIN NOW A few days after this Eugene called at de Restaud's house; she was not at home. END
BEGIN NOW Three times he tried the experiment, and three times he found her doors closed against him, though he was careful to choose an hour when M. de Trailles was not there. END
BEGIN NOW The Vicomtesse was right. END
BEGIN NOW The student studied no longer. END
BEGIN NOW He put in an appearance at lectures simply to answer to his name, and after thus attesting his presence, departed forthwith. END
BEGIN NOW He had been through a reasoning process familiar to most students. END
BEGIN NOW He had seen the advisability of deferring his studies to the last moment before going up for his examinations; he made up his mind to cram his second and third years' work into the third year, when he meant to begin to work in earnest, and to complete his studies in law with one great effort. END
BEGIN NOW In the meantime he had fifteen months in which to navigate the ocean of Paris, to spread the nets and set the lines that would bring him a protectress and a fortune. END
BEGIN NOW Twice during that week he saw de Beauseant; he did not go to her house until he had seen the Marquis d'Ajuda drive away. END
BEGIN NOW Victory for yet a few more days was with the great lady, the most poetic figure in the Faubourg Saint-Germain; and the marriage of the Marquis d'Ajuda-Pinto with Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW de Rochefide was postponed. END
BEGIN NOW The dread of losing her happiness filled those days with a fever of joy unknown before, but the end was only so much the nearer. END
BEGIN NOW The Marquis d'Ajuda and the Rochefides agreed that this quarrel and reconciliation was a very fortunate thing; de Beauseant (so they hoped) would gradually become reconciled to the idea of the marriage, and in the end would be brought to sacrifice d'Ajuda's morning visits to the exigencies of a man's career, exigencies which she must have foreseen. END
BEGIN NOW In spite of the most solemn promises, daily renewed, M. d'Ajuda was playing a part, and the Vicomtesse was eager to be deceived. END
BEGIN NOW Instead of taking a leap heroically from the window, she is falling headlong down the staircase, said her most intimate friend, the Duchesse de Langeais. END
BEGIN NOW Yet this after-glow of happiness lasted long enough for the Vicomtesse to be of service to her young cousin. END
BEGIN NOW She had a half-superstitious affection for him. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene had shown her sympathy and devotion at a crisis when a woman sees no pity, no real comfort in any eyes; when if a man is ready with soothing flatteries, it is because he has an interested motive. END
BEGIN NOW Rastignac made up his mind that he must learn the whole of Goriot's previous history; he would come to his bearings before attempting to board the Maison de Nucingen. END
BEGIN NOW The results of his inquiries may be given briefly as follows:&mdash; In the days before the Revolution, Jean-Joachim Goriot was simply a workman in the employ of a vermicelli maker. END
BEGIN NOW He was a skilful, thrifty workman, sufficiently enterprising to buy his master's business when the latter fell a chance victim to the disturbances of Goriot established himself in the Rue de la Jussienne, close to the Corn Exchange. END
BEGIN NOW His plain good sense led him to accept the position of President of the Section, so as to secure for his business the protection of those in power at that dangerous epoch. END
BEGIN NOW This prudent step had led to success; the foundations of his fortune were laid in the time of the Scarcity (real or artificial), when the price of grain of all kinds rose enormously in Paris. END
BEGIN NOW People used to fight for bread at the bakers' doors; while other persons went to the grocers' shops and bought Italian paste foods without brawling over it. END
BEGIN NOW It was during this year that Goriot made the money, which, at a later time, was to give him all the advantage of the great capitalist over the small buyer; he had, moreover, the usual luck of average ability; his mediocrity was the salvation of him. END
BEGIN NOW He excited no one's envy, it was not even suspected that he was rich till the peril of being rich was over, and all his intelligence was concentrated, not on political, but on commercial speculations. END
BEGIN NOW Goriot was an authority second to none on all questions relating to corn, flour, and middlings ; and the production, storage, and quality of grain. END
BEGIN NOW He could estimate the yield of the harvest, and foresee market prices; he bought his cereals in Sicily, and imported Russian wheat. END
BEGIN NOW Any one who had heard him hold forth on the regulations that control the importation and exportation of grain, who had seen his grasp of the subject, his clear insight into the principles involved, his appreciation of weak points in the way that the system worked, would have thought that here was the stuff of which a minister is made. END
BEGIN NOW Patient, active, and persevering, energetic and prompt in action, he surveyed his business horizon with an eagle eye. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing there took him by surprise; he foresaw all things, knew all that was happening, and kept his own counsel; he was a diplomatist in his quick comprehension of a situation; and in the routine of business he was as patient and plodding as a soldier on the march. END
BEGIN NOW But beyond this business horizon he could not see. END
BEGIN NOW He used to spend his hours of leisure on the threshold of his shop, leaning against the framework of the door. END
BEGIN NOW Take him from his dark little counting-house, and he became once more the rough, slow-witted workman, a man who cannot understand a piece of reasoning, who is indifferent to all intellectual pleasures, and falls asleep at the play, a Parisian Dolibom in short, against whose stupidity other minds are powerless. END
BEGIN NOW Natures of this kind are nearly all alike; in almost all of them you will find some hidden depth of sublime affection. END
BEGIN NOW Two all-absorbing affections filled the vermicelli maker's heart to the exclusion of every other feeling; into them he seemed to put all the forces of his nature, as he put the whole power of his brain into the corn trade. END
BEGIN NOW He had regarded his wife, the only daughter of a rich farmer of La Brie, with a devout admiration; his love for her had been boundless. END
BEGIN NOW Goriot had felt the charm of a lovely and sensitive nature, which, in its delicate strength, was the very opposite of his own. END
BEGIN NOW Is there any instinct more deeply implanted in the heart of man than the pride of protection, a protection which is constantly exerted for a fragile and defenceless creature? END
BEGIN NOW Join love thereto, the warmth of gratitude that all generous souls feel for the source of their pleasures, and you have the explanation of many strange incongruities in human nature. END
BEGIN NOW After seven years of unclouded happiness, Goriot lost his wife. END
BEGIN NOW It was very unfortunate for him. END
BEGIN NOW She was beginning to gain an ascendency over him in other ways; possibly she might have brought that barren soil under cultivation, she might have widened his ideas and given other directions to his thoughts. END
BEGIN NOW But when she was dead, the instinct of fatherhood developed in him till it almost became a mania. END
BEGIN NOW All the affection balked by death seemed to turn to his daughters, and he found full satisfaction for his heart in loving them. END
BEGIN NOW More or less brilliant proposals were made to him from time to time; wealthy merchants or farmers with daughters vied with each other in offering inducements to him to marry again; but he determined to remain a widower. END
BEGIN NOW His father-in-law, the only man for whom he felt a decided friendship, gave out that Goriot had made a vow to be faithful to his wife's memory. END
BEGIN NOW The frequenters of the Corn Exchange, who could not comprehend this sublime piece of folly, joked about it among themselves, and found a ridiculous nickname for him. END
BEGIN NOW One of them ventured (after a glass over a bargain) to call him by it, and a blow from the vermicelli maker's fist sent him headlong into a gutter in the Rue Oblin. END
BEGIN NOW He could think of nothing else when his children were concerned; his love for them made him fidgety and anxious; and this was so well known, that one day a competitor, who wished to get rid of him to secure the field to himself, told Goriot that Delphine had just been knocked down by a cab. END
BEGIN NOW The vermicelli maker turned ghastly pale, left the Exchange at once, and did not return for several days afterwards; he was ill in consequence of the shock and the subsequent relief on discovering that it was a false alarm. END
BEGIN NOW This time, however, the offender did not escape with a bruised shoulder; at a critical moment in the man's affairs, Goriot drove him into bankruptcy, and forced him to disappear from the Corn Exchange. END
BEGIN NOW As might have been expected, the two girls were spoiled. END
BEGIN NOW With an income of sixty thousand francs, Goriot scarcely spent twelve hundred on himself, and found all his happiness in satisfying the whims of the two girls. END
BEGIN NOW The best masters were engaged, that Anastasie and Delphine might be endowed with all the accomplishments which distinguish a good education. END
BEGIN NOW They had a chaperon&mdash;luckily for them, she was a woman who had good sense and good taste;&mdash;they learned to ride; they had a carriage for their use; they lived as the mistress of a rich old lord might live; they had only to express a wish, their father would hasten to give them their most extravagant desires, and asked nothing of them in return but a kiss. END
BEGIN NOW Goriot had raised the two girls to the level of the angels; and, quite naturally, he himself was left beneath them. END
BEGIN NOW Poor man! END
BEGIN NOW he loved them even for the pain that they gave him. END
BEGIN NOW When the girls were old enough to be married, they were left free to choose for themselves. END
BEGIN NOW Each had half her father's fortune as her dowry; and when the Comte de Restaud came to woo Anastasie for her beauty, her social aspirations led her to leave her father's house for a more exalted sphere. END
BEGIN NOW Delphine wished for money; she married Nucingen, a banker of German extraction, who became a Baron of the Holy Roman Empire. END
BEGIN NOW Goriot remained a vermicelli maker as before. END
BEGIN NOW His daughters and his sons-in-law began to demur; they did not like to see him still engaged in trade, though his whole life was bound up with his business. END
BEGIN NOW For five years he stood out against their entreaties, then he yielded, and consented to retire on the amount realized by the sale of his business and the savings of the last few years. END
BEGIN NOW It was this capital that Vauquer, in the early days of his residence with her, had calculated would bring in eight or ten thousand livres in a year. END
BEGIN NOW He had taken refuge in her lodging-house, driven there by despair when he knew that his daughters were compelled by their husbands not only to refuse to receive him as an inmate in their houses, but even to see him no more except in private. END
BEGIN NOW This was all the information which Rastignac gained from a M. Muret who had purchased Goriot's business, information which confirmed the Duchesse de Langeais' suppositions, and herewith the preliminary explanation of this obscure but terrible Parisian tragedy comes to an end. END
BEGIN NOW Towards the end of the first week in December Rastignac received two letters&mdash;one from his mother, and one from his eldest sister. END
BEGIN NOW His heart beat fast, half with happiness, half with fear, at the sight of the familiar handwriting. END
BEGIN NOW Those two little scraps of paper contained life or death for his hopes. END
BEGIN NOW But while he felt a shiver of dread as he remembered their dire poverty at home, he knew their love for him so well that he could not help fearing that he was draining their very life-blood. END
BEGIN NOW His mother's letter ran as follows:&mdash; MY DEAR CHILD,&mdash;I am sending you the money that you asked for. END
BEGIN NOW Make a good use of it. END
BEGIN NOW Even to save your life I could not raise so large a sum a second time without your father's knowledge, and there would be trouble about it. END
BEGIN NOW We should be obliged to mortgage the land. END
BEGIN NOW It is impossible to judge of the merits of schemes of which I am ignorant; but what sort of schemes can they be, that you should fear to tell me about them? END
BEGIN NOW Volumes of explanation would not have been needed; we mothers can understand at a word, and that word would have spared me the anguish of uncertainty. END
BEGIN NOW I do not know how to hide the painful impression that your letter has made upon me, my dear son. END
BEGIN NOW What can you have felt when you were moved to send this chill of dread through my heart? END
BEGIN NOW It must have been very painful to you to write the letter that gave me so much pain as I read it. END
BEGIN NOW To what courses are you committed? END
BEGIN NOW You are going to appear to be something that you are not, and your whole life and success depends upon this? END
BEGIN NOW You are about to see a society into which you cannot enter without rushing into expense that you cannot afford, without losing precious time that is needed for your studies. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW my dear Eugene, believe your mother, crooked ways cannot lead to great ends. END
BEGIN NOW Patience and endurance are the two qualities most needed in your position. END
BEGIN NOW I am not scolding you; I do not want any tinge of bitterness to spoil our offering. END
BEGIN NOW I am only talking like a mother whose trust in you is as great as her foresight for you. END
BEGIN NOW You know the steps that you must take, and I, for my part, know the purity of heart, and how good your intentions are; so I can say to you without a doubt, 'Go forward, beloved!' END
BEGIN NOW If I tremble, it is because I am a mother, but my prayers and blessings will be with you at every step. END
BEGIN NOW Be very careful, dear boy. END
BEGIN NOW You must have a man's prudence, for it lies with you to shape the destinies of five others who are dear to you, and must look to you. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, our fortunes depend upon you, and your success is ours. END
BEGIN NOW We all pray to God to be with you in all that you do. END
BEGIN NOW Your aunt Marcillac has been most generous beyond words in this matter; she saw at once how it was, even down to your gloves. END
BEGIN NOW 'But I have a weakness for the eldest!' END
BEGIN NOW she said gaily. END
BEGIN NOW You must love your aunt very much, dear Eugene. END
BEGIN NOW I shall wait till you have succeeded before telling you all that she has done for you, or her money would burn your fingers. END
BEGIN NOW You, who are young, do not know what it is to part with something that is a piece of your past! END
BEGIN NOW But what would we not sacrifice for your sakes? END
BEGIN NOW Your aunt says that I am to send you a kiss on the forehead from her, and that kiss is to bring you luck again and again, she says. END
BEGIN NOW She would have written you herself, the dear kind-hearted woman, but she is troubled with the gout in her fingers just now. END
BEGIN NOW Your father is very well. END
BEGIN NOW The vintage of has turned out better than we expected. END
BEGIN NOW Good-bye, dear boy; I will say nothing about your sisters, because Laure is writing to you, and I must let her have the pleasure of giving you all the home news. END
BEGIN NOW Heaven send that you may succeed! END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW yes, dear Eugene, you must succeed. END
BEGIN NOW I have come, through you, to a knowledge of a pain so sharp that I do not think I could endure it a second time. END
BEGIN NOW I have come to know what it is to be poor, and to long for money for my children's sake. END
BEGIN NOW There, good-bye! END
BEGIN NOW Do not leave us for long without news of you; and here, at the last, take a kiss from your mother. END
BEGIN NOW By the time Eugene had finished the letter he was in tears. END
BEGIN NOW He thought of Father Goriot crushing his silver keepsake into a shapeless mass before he sold it to meet his daughter's bill of exchange. END
BEGIN NOW Your mother has broken up her jewels for you, he said to himself; your aunt shed tears over those relics of hers before she sold them for your sake. END
BEGIN NOW What right have you to heap execrations on Anastasie? END
BEGIN NOW You have followed her example; you have selfishly sacrificed others to your own future, and she sacrifices her father to her lover; and of you two, which is the worse? END
BEGIN NOW He was ready to renounce his attempts; he could not bear to take that money. END
BEGIN NOW The fires of remorse burned in his heart, and gave him intolerable pain, the generous secret remorse which men seldom take into account when they sit in judgment upon their fellow-men; but perhaps the angels in heaven, beholding it, pardon the criminal whom our justice condemns. END
BEGIN NOW Rastignac opened his sister's letter; its simplicity and kindness revived his heart. END
BEGIN NOW Your letter came just at the right time, dear brother. END
BEGIN NOW Agathe and I had thought of so many different ways of spending our money, that we did not know what to buy with it; and now you have come in, and, like the servant who upset all the watches that belonged to the King of Spain, you have restored harmony; for, really and truly, we did not know which of all the things we wanted we wanted most, and we were always quarreling about it, never thinking, dear Eugene, of a way of spending our money which would satisfy us completely. END
BEGIN NOW Agathe jumped for you. END
BEGIN NOW Indeed, we have been like two mad things all day, 'to such a prodigious degree' (as aunt would say), that mother said, with her severe expression, 'Whatever can be the matter with you, mesdemoiselles?' END
BEGIN NOW I think if we had been scolded a little, we should have been still better pleased. END
BEGIN NOW A woman ought to be very glad to suffer for one she loves! END
BEGIN NOW I, however, in my inmost soul, was doleful and cross in the midst of all my joy. END
BEGIN NOW I shall make a bad wife, I am afraid, I am too fond of spending. END
BEGIN NOW I had bought two sashes and a nice little stiletto for piercing eyelet-holes in my stays, trifles that I really did not want, so that I have less than that slow-coach Agathe, who is so economical, and hoards her money like a magpie. END
BEGIN NOW She had two hundred francs! END
BEGIN NOW And I have only one hundred and fifty! END
BEGIN NOW I am nicely punished; I could throw my sash down the well; it will be painful to me to wear it now. END
BEGIN NOW Poor dear, I have robbed you. END
BEGIN NOW And Agathe was so nice about it. END
BEGIN NOW She said, 'Let us send the three hundred and fifty francs in our two names!' END
BEGIN NOW But I could not help telling you everything just as it happened. END
BEGIN NOW Do you know how we managed to keep your commandments? END
BEGIN NOW We took our glittering hoard, we went out for a walk, and when once fairly on the highway we ran all the way to Ruffec, where we handed over the coin, without more ado, to M. Grimbert of the Messageries Royales. END
BEGIN NOW We came back again like swallows on the wing. END
BEGIN NOW 'Don't you think that happiness has made us lighter?' END
BEGIN NOW Agathe said. END
BEGIN NOW We said all sorts of things, which I shall not tell you, Monsieur le Parisien, because they were all about you. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, we love you dearly, dear brother; it was all summed up in those few words. END
BEGIN NOW As for keeping the secret, little masqueraders like us are capable of anything (according to our aunt), even of holding our tongues. END
BEGIN NOW Our mother has been on a mysterious journey to Angouleme, and the aunt went with her, not without solemn councils, from which we were shut out, and M. le Baron likewise. END
BEGIN NOW They are silent as to the weighty political considerations that prompted their mission, and conjectures are rife in the State of Rastignac. END
BEGIN NOW The Infantas are embroidering a muslin robe with open-work sprigs for her Majesty the Queen; the work progresses in the most profound secrecy. END
BEGIN NOW There be but two more breadths to finish. END
BEGIN NOW A decree has gone forth that no wall shall be built on the side of Verteuil, but that a hedge shall be planted instead thereof. END
BEGIN NOW Our subjects may sustain some disappointment of fruit and espaliers, but strangers will enjoy a fair prospect. END
BEGIN NOW Should the heir-presumptive lack pocket-handkerchiefs, be it known unto him that the dowager Lady of Marcillac, exploring the recesses of her drawers and boxes (known respectively as Pompeii and Herculaneum), having brought to light a fair piece of cambric whereof she wotted not, the Princesses Agathe and Laure place at their brother's disposal their thread, their needles, and hands somewhat of the reddest. END
BEGIN NOW The two young Princes, Don Henri and Don Gabriel, retain their fatal habits of stuffing themselves with grape-jelly, of teasing their sisters, of taking their pleasure by going a-bird-nesting, and of cutting switches for themselves from the osier-beds, maugre the laws of the realm. END
BEGIN NOW Moreover, they list not to learn naught, wherefore the Papal Nuncio (called of the commonalty, M. le Cure) threateneth them with excommunication, since that they neglect the sacred canons of grammatical construction for the construction of other canon, deadly engines made of the stems of elder. END
BEGIN NOW Farewell, dear brother, never did letter carry so many wishes for your success, so much love fully satisfied. END
BEGIN NOW You will have a great deal to tell us when you come home! END
BEGIN NOW You will tell me everything, won't you? END
BEGIN NOW I am the oldest. END
BEGIN NOW From something the aunt let fall, we think you must have had some success. END
BEGIN NOW Something was said of a lady, but nothing more was said... Of course not, in our family! END
BEGIN NOW Oh, by-the-by, Eugene, would you rather that we made that piece of cambric into shirts for you instead of pocket-handkerchiefs? END
BEGIN NOW If you want some really nice shirts at once, we ought to lose no time in beginning upon them; and if the fashion is different now in Paris, send us one for a pattern; we want more particularly to know about the cuffs. END
BEGIN NOW Good- bye! END
BEGIN NOW Good-bye! END
BEGIN NOW Take my kiss on the left side of your forehead, on the temple that belongs to me, and to no one else in the world. END
BEGIN NOW I am leaving the other side of the sheet for Agathe, who has solemnly promised not to read a word that I have written; but, all the same, I mean to sit by her side while she writes, so as to be quite sure that she keeps her word.&mdash;Your loving sister, LAURE DE RASTIGNAC. END
BEGIN NOW Yes! END
BEGIN NOW said Eugene to himself. END
BEGIN NOW Yes! END
BEGIN NOW Success at all costs now! END
BEGIN NOW Riches could not repay such devotion as this. END
BEGIN NOW I wish I could give them every sort of happiness! END
BEGIN NOW Fifteen hundred and fifty francs, he went on after a pause. END
BEGIN NOW Every shot must go to the mark! END
BEGIN NOW Laure is right. END
BEGIN NOW Trust a woman! END
BEGIN NOW I have only calico shirts. END
BEGIN NOW Where some one else's welfare is concerned, a young girl becomes as ingenious as a thief. END
BEGIN NOW Guileless where she herself is in question, and full of foresight for me,&mdash;she is like a heavenly angel forgiving the strange incomprehensible sins of earth. END
BEGIN NOW The world lay before him. END
BEGIN NOW His tailor had been summoned and sounded, and had finally surrendered. END
BEGIN NOW When Rastignac met M. de Trailles, he had seen at once how great a part the tailor plays in a young man's career; a tailor is either a deadly enemy or a staunch friend, with an invoice for a bond of friendship; between these two extremes there is, alack! END
BEGIN NOW no middle term. END
BEGIN NOW In this representative of his craft Eugene discovered a man who understood that his was a sort of paternal function for young men at their entrance into life, who regarded himself as a stepping-stone between a young man's present and future. END
BEGIN NOW And Rastignac in gratitude made the man's fortune by an epigram of a kind in which he excelled at a later period of his life. END
BEGIN NOW I have twice known a pair of trousers turned out by him make a match of twenty thousand livres a year! END
BEGIN NOW Fifteen hundred francs, and as many suits of clothes as he chose to order! END
BEGIN NOW At that moment the poor child of the South felt no more doubts of any kind. END
BEGIN NOW The young man went down to breakfast with the indefinable air which the consciousness of the possession of money gives to youth. END
BEGIN NOW No sooner are the coins slipped into a student's pocket than his wealth, in imagination at least, is piled into a fantastic column, which affords him a moral support. END
BEGIN NOW He begins to hold up his head as he walks; he is conscious that he has a means of bringing his powers to bear on a given point; he looks you straight in the face; his gestures are quick and decided; only yesterday he was diffident and shy, any one might have pushed him aside; to-morrow, he will take the wall of a prime minister. END
BEGIN NOW A miracle has been wrought in him. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing is beyond the reach of his ambition, and his ambition soars at random; he is light-hearted, generous, and enthusiastic; in short, the fledgling bird has discovered that he has wings. END
BEGIN NOW A poor student snatches at every chance pleasure much as a dog runs all sorts of risks to steal a bone, cracking it and sucking the marrow as he flies from pursuit; but a young man who can rattle a few runaway gold coins in his pocket can take his pleasure deliberately, can taste the whole of the sweets of secure possession; he soars far above earth; he has forgotten what the word _poverty_ means; all Paris is his. END
BEGIN NOW Those are days when the whole world shines radiant with light, when everything glows and sparkles before the eyes of youth, days that bring joyous energy that is never brought into harness, days of debts and of painful fears that go hand in hand with every delight. END
BEGIN NOW Those who do not know the left bank of the Seine between the Rue Saint-Jacques and the Rue des Saints-Peres know nothing of life. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW if the women of Paris but knew, said Rastignac, as he devoured Vauquer's stewed pears (at five for a penny), they would come here in search of a lover. END
BEGIN NOW Just then a porter from the Messageries Royales appeared at the door of the room; they had previously heard the bell ring as the wicket opened to admit him. END
BEGIN NOW The man asked for M. Eugene de Rastignac, holding out two bags for him to take, and a form of receipt for his signature. END
BEGIN NOW Vautrin's keen glance cut Eugene like a lash. END
BEGIN NOW Now you will be able to pay for those fencing lessons and go to the shooting gallery, he said. END
BEGIN NOW Your ship has come in, said Vauquer, eyeing the bags. END
BEGIN NOW Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau did not dare to look at the money, for fear her eyes should betray her cupidity. END
BEGIN NOW You have a kind mother, said Couture. END
BEGIN NOW You have a kind mother, sir, echoed Poiret. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, mamma has been drained dry, said Vautrin, and now you can have your fling, go into society, and fish for heiresses, and dance with countesses who have peach blossom in their hair. END
BEGIN NOW But take my advice, young man, and don't neglect your pistol practice. END
BEGIN NOW Vautrin struck an attitude, as if he were facing an antagonist. END
BEGIN NOW Rastignac, meaning to give the porter a tip, felt in his pockets and found nothing. END
BEGIN NOW Vautrin flung down a franc piece on the table. END
BEGIN NOW Your credit is good, he remarked, eyeing the student, and Rastignac was forced to thank him, though, since the sharp encounter of wits at dinner that day, after Eugene came in from calling on de Beauseant, he had made up his mind that Vautrin was insufferable. END
BEGIN NOW For a week, in fact, they had both kept silence in each other's presence, and watched each other. END
BEGIN NOW The student tried in vain to account to himself for this attitude. END
BEGIN NOW An idea, of course, gains in force by the energy with which it is expressed; it strikes where the brain sends it, by a law as mathematically exact as the law that determines the course of a shell from a mortar. END
BEGIN NOW The amount of impression it makes is not to be determined so exactly. END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes, in an impressible nature, the idea works havoc, but there are, no less, natures so robustly protected, that this sort of projectile falls flat and harmless on skulls of triple brass, as cannon-shot against solid masonry; then there are flaccid and spongy-fibred natures into which ideas from without sink like spent bullets into the earthworks of a redoubt. END
BEGIN NOW Rastignac's head was something of the powder-magazine order; the least shock sufficed to bring about an explosion. END
BEGIN NOW He was too quick, too young, not to be readily accessible to ideas; and open to that subtle influence of thought and feeling in others which causes so many strange phenomena that make an impression upon us of which we are all unconscious at the time. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing escaped his mental vision; he was lynx-eyed; in him the mental powers of perception, which seem like duplicates of the senses, had the mysterious power of swift projection that astonishes us in intellects of a high order&mdash;slingers who are quick to detect the weak spot in any armor. END
BEGIN NOW In the past month Eugene's good qualities and defects had rapidly developed with his character. END
BEGIN NOW Intercourse with the world and the endeavor to satisfy his growing desires had brought out his defects. END
BEGIN NOW But Rastignac came from the South side of the Loire, and had the good qualities of his countrymen. END
BEGIN NOW He had the impetuous courage of the South, that rushes to the attack of a difficulty, as well as the southern impatience of delay or suspense. END
BEGIN NOW These traits are held to be defects in the North; they made the fortune of Murat, but they likewise cut short his career. END
BEGIN NOW The moral would appear to be that when the dash and boldness of the South side of the Loire meets, in a southern temperament, with the guile of the North, the character is complete, and such a man will gain (and keep) the crown of Sweden. END
BEGIN NOW Rastignac, therefore, could not stand the fire from Vautrin's batteries for long without discovering whether this was a friend or a foe. END
BEGIN NOW He felt as if this strange being was reading his inmost soul, and dissecting his feelings, while Vautrin himself was so close and secretive that he seemed to have something of the profound and unmoved serenity of a sphinx, seeing and hearing all things and saying nothing. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene, conscious of that money in his pocket, grew rebellious. END
BEGIN NOW Be so good as to wait a moment, he said to Vautrin, as the latter rose, after slowly emptying his coffee-cup, sip by sip. END
BEGIN NOW What for? END
BEGIN NOW inquired the older man, as he put on his large-brimmed hat and took up the sword-cane that he was wont to twirl like a man who will face three or four footpads without flinching. END
BEGIN NOW I will repay you in a minute, returned Eugene. END
BEGIN NOW He unsealed one of the bags as he spoke, counted out a hundred and forty francs, and pushed them towards Vauquer. END
BEGIN NOW Short reckonings make good friends he added, turning to the widow; that clears our accounts till the end of the year. END
BEGIN NOW Can you give me change for a five-franc piece? END
BEGIN NOW Good friends make short reckonings, echoed Poiret, with a glance at Vautrin. END
BEGIN NOW Here is your franc, said Rastignac, holding out the coin to the sphinx in the black wig. END
BEGIN NOW Any one might think that you were afraid to owe me a trifle, exclaimed this latter, with a searching glance that seemed to read the young man's inmost thoughts; there was a satirical and cynical smile on Vautrin's face such as Eugene had seen scores of times already; every time he saw it, it exasperated him almost beyond endurance. END
BEGIN NOW Well... so I am, he answered. END
BEGIN NOW He held both the bags in his hand, and had risen to go up to his room. END
BEGIN NOW Vautrin made as if he were going out through the sitting-room, and the student turned to go through the second door that opened into the square lobby at the foot of the staircase. END
BEGIN NOW Do you know, Monsieur le Marquis de Rastignacorama, that what you were saying just now was not exactly polite? END
BEGIN NOW Vautrin remarked, as he rattled his sword-cane across the panels of the sitting-room door, and came up to the student. END
BEGIN NOW Rastignac looked coolly at Vautrin, drew him to the foot of the staircase, and shut the dining-room door. END
BEGIN NOW They were standing in the little square lobby between the kitchen and the dining-room; the place was lighted by an iron-barred fanlight above a door that gave access into the garden. END
BEGIN NOW Sylvie came out of her kitchen, and Eugene chose that moment to say: _Monsieur_ Vautrin, I am not a marquis, and my name is not Rastignacorama. END
BEGIN NOW They will fight, said Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau, in an indifferent tone. END
BEGIN NOW Fight! END
BEGIN NOW echoed Poiret. END
BEGIN NOW Not they, replied Vauquer, lovingly fingering her pile of coins. END
BEGIN NOW But there they are under the lime-trees, cried Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Victorine, who had risen so that she might see out into the garden. END
BEGIN NOW Poor young man! END
BEGIN NOW he was in the right, after all. END
BEGIN NOW We must go upstairs, my pet, said Couture; it is no business of ours. END
BEGIN NOW At the door, however, Couture and Victorine found their progress barred by the portly form of Sylvie the cook. END
BEGIN NOW What ever can have happened? END
BEGIN NOW she said. END
BEGIN NOW M. Vautrin said to M. Eugene, 'Let us have an explanation!' END
BEGIN NOW then he took him by the arm, and there they are, out among the artichokes. END
BEGIN NOW Vautrin came in while she was speaking. END
BEGIN NOW Mamma Vauquer, he said smiling, don't frighten yourself at all. END
BEGIN NOW I am only going to try my pistols under the lime-trees. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW monsieur, cried Victorine, clasping her hands as she spoke, why do you want to kill M. Eugene? END
BEGIN NOW Vautrin stepped back a pace or two, and gazed at Victorine. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW this is something fresh! END
BEGIN NOW he exclaimed in a bantering tone, that brought the color into the poor girl's face. END
BEGIN NOW That young fellow yonder is very nice, isn't he? END
BEGIN NOW he went on. END
BEGIN NOW You have given me a notion, my pretty child; I will make you both happy. END
BEGIN NOW Couture laid her hand on the arm of her ward, and drew the girl away, as she said in her ear: Why, Victorine, I cannot imagine what has come over you this morning. END
BEGIN NOW I don't want any shots fired in my garden, said Vauquer. END
BEGIN NOW You will frighten the neighborhood and bring the police up here all in a moment. END
BEGIN NOW Come, keep cool, Mamma Vauquer, answered Vautrin. END
BEGIN NOW There, there; it's all right; we will go to the shooting-gallery. END
BEGIN NOW He went back to Rastignac, laying his hand familiarly on the young man's arm. END
BEGIN NOW When I have given you ocular demonstration of the fact that I can put a bullet through the ace on a card five times running at thirty-five paces, he said, that won't take away your appetite, I suppose? END
BEGIN NOW You look to me to be inclined to be a trifle quarrelsome this morning, and as if you would rush on your death like a blockhead. END
BEGIN NOW Do you draw back? END
BEGIN NOW asked Eugene. END
BEGIN NOW Don't try to raise my temperature, answered Vautrin, it is not cold this morning. END
BEGIN NOW Let us go and sit over there, he added, pointing to the green-painted garden seats; no one can overhear us. END
BEGIN NOW I want a little talk with you. END
BEGIN NOW You are not a bad sort of youngster, and I have no quarrel with you. END
BEGIN NOW I like you, take Trump&mdash;(confound it! END
BEGIN NOW )&mdash;take Vautrin's word for it. END
BEGIN NOW What makes me like you? END
BEGIN NOW I will tell you by-and-by. END
BEGIN NOW Meantime, I can tell you that I know you as well as if I had made you myself, as I will prove to you in a minute. END
BEGIN NOW Put down your bags, he continued, pointing to the round table. END
BEGIN NOW Rastignac deposited his money on the table, and sat down. END
BEGIN NOW He was consumed with curiosity, which the sudden change in the manner of the man before him had excited to the highest pitch. END
BEGIN NOW Here was a strange being who, a moment ago, had talked of killing him, and now posed as his protector. END
BEGIN NOW You would like to know who I really am, what I was, and what I do now, Vautrin went on. END
BEGIN NOW You want to know too much, youngster. END
BEGIN NOW Come! END
BEGIN NOW come! END
BEGIN NOW keep cool! END
BEGIN NOW You will hear more astonishing things than that. END
BEGIN NOW I have had my misfortunes. END
BEGIN NOW Just hear me out first, and you shall have your turn afterwards. END
BEGIN NOW Here is my past in three words. END
BEGIN NOW Who am I? END
BEGIN NOW Vautrin. END
BEGIN NOW What do I do? END
BEGIN NOW Just what I please. END
BEGIN NOW Let us change the subject. END
BEGIN NOW You want to know my character. END
BEGIN NOW I am good-natured to those who do me a good turn, or to those whose hearts speak to mine. END
BEGIN NOW These last may do anything they like with me; they may bruise my shins, and I shall not tell them to 'mind what they are about'; but, _nom d'une pipe_, the devil himself is not an uglier customer than I can be if people annoy me, or if I don't happen to take to them; and you may just as well know at once that I think no more of killing a man than of that, and he spat before him as he spoke. END
BEGIN NOW Only when it is absolutely necessary to do so, I do my best to kill him properly. END
BEGIN NOW I am what you call an artist. END
BEGIN NOW I have read Benvenuto Cellini's _Memoirs_, such as you see me; and, what is more, in Italian: A fine-spirited fellow he was! END
BEGIN NOW From him I learned to follow the example set us by Providence, who strikes us down at random, and to admire the beautiful whenever and wherever it is found. END
BEGIN NOW And, setting other questions aside, is it not a glorious part to play, when you pit yourself against mankind, and the luck is on your side? END
BEGIN NOW I have thought a good deal about the constitution of your present social Dis-order. END
BEGIN NOW A duel is downright childish, my boy! END
BEGIN NOW utter nonsense and folly! END
BEGIN NOW When one of two living men must be got out of the way, none but an idiot would leave chance to decide which it is to be; and in a duel it is a toss-up&mdash;heads or tails&mdash;and there you are! END
BEGIN NOW Now I, for instance, can hit the ace in the middle of a card five times running, send one bullet after another through the same hole, and at thirty-five paces, moreover! END
BEGIN NOW With that little accomplishment you might think yourself certain of killing your man, mightn't you. END
BEGIN NOW Well, I have fired, at twenty paces, and missed, and the rogue who had never handled a pistol in his life&mdash;look here! END
BEGIN NOW &mdash;(he unbuttoned his waistcoat and exposed his chest, covered, like a bear's back, with a shaggy fell; the student gave a startled shudder)&mdash; he was a raw lad, but he made his mark on me, the extraordinary man went on, drawing Rastignac's fingers over a deep scar on his breast. END
BEGIN NOW But that happened when I myself was a mere boy; I was one-and-twenty then (your age), and I had some beliefs left&mdash;in a woman's love, and in a pack of rubbish that you will be over head and ears in directly. END
BEGIN NOW You and I were to have fought just now, weren't we? END
BEGIN NOW You might have killed me. END
BEGIN NOW Suppose that I were put under the earth, where would you be? END
BEGIN NOW You would have to clear out of this, go to Switzerland, draw on papa's purse&mdash;and he has none too much in it as it is. END
BEGIN NOW I mean to open your eyes to your real position, that is what I am going to do: but I shall do it from the point of view of a man who, after studying the world very closely, sees that there are but two alternatives&mdash;stupid obedience or revolt. END
BEGIN NOW I obey nobody; is that clear? END
BEGIN NOW Now, do you know how much you will want at the pace you are going? END
BEGIN NOW A million; and promptly, too, or that little head of ours will be swaying to and fro in the drag-nets at Saint-Cloud, while we are gone to find out whether or no there is a Supreme Being. END
BEGIN NOW I will put you in the way of that million. END
BEGIN NOW He stopped for a moment and looked at Eugene. END
BEGIN NOW Aha! END
BEGIN NOW you do not look so sourly at papa Vautrin now! END
BEGIN NOW At the mention of the million you look like a young girl when somebody has said, 'I will come for you this evening!' END
BEGIN NOW and she betakes herself to her toilette as a cat licks its whiskers over a saucer of milk. END
BEGIN NOW All right. END
BEGIN NOW Come, now, let us go into the question, young man; all between ourselves, you know. END
BEGIN NOW We have a papa and mamma down yonder, a great-aunt, two sisters (aged eighteen and seventeen), two young brothers (one fifteen, and the other ten), that is about the roll-call of the crew. END
BEGIN NOW The aunt brings up the two sisters; the cure comes and teaches the boys Latin. END
BEGIN NOW Boiled chestnuts are oftener on the table than white bread. END
BEGIN NOW Papa makes a suit of clothes last a long while; if mamma has a different dress winter and summer, it is about as much as she has; the sisters manage as best they can. END
BEGIN NOW I know all about it; I have lived in the south. END
BEGIN NOW That is how things are at home. END
BEGIN NOW They send you twelve hundred francs a year, and the whole property only brings in three thousand francs all told. END
BEGIN NOW We have a cook and a manservant; papa is a baron, and we must keep up appearances. END
BEGIN NOW Then we have our ambitions; we are connected with the Beauseants, and we go afoot through the streets; we want to be rich, and we have not a penny; we eat Vauquer's messes, and we like grand dinners in the Faubourg Saint-Germain; we sleep on a truckle-bed, and dream of a mansion! END
BEGIN NOW I do not blame you for wanting these things. END
BEGIN NOW What sort of men do the women run after? END
BEGIN NOW Men of ambition. END
BEGIN NOW Men of ambition have stronger frames, their blood is richer in iron, their hearts are warmer than those of ordinary men. END
BEGIN NOW Women feel that when their power is greatest, they look their best, and that those are their happiest hours; they like power in men, and prefer the strongest even if it is a power that may be their own destruction. END
BEGIN NOW I am going to make an inventory of your desires in order to put the question at issue before you. END
BEGIN NOW Here it is:&mdash; We are as hungry as a wolf, and those newly-cut teeth of ours are sharp; what are we to do to keep the pot boiling? END
BEGIN NOW In the first place, we have the Code to browse upon; it is not amusing, and we are none the wiser for it, but that cannot be helped. END
BEGIN NOW So far so good. END
BEGIN NOW We mean to make an advocate of ourselves with a prospect of one day being made President of a Court of Assize, when we shall send poor devils, our betters, to the galleys with a T.F. END
BEGIN NOW on their shoulders, so that the rich may be convinced that they can sleep in peace. END
BEGIN NOW There is no fun in that; and you are a long while coming to it; for, to begin with, there are two years of nauseous drudgery in Paris, we see all the lollipops that we long for out of our reach. END
BEGIN NOW It is tiresome to want things and never to have them. END
BEGIN NOW If you were a pallid creature of the mollusk order, you would have nothing to fear, but it is different when you have the hot blood of a lion and are ready to get into a score of scrapes every day of your life. END
BEGIN NOW This is the ghastliest form of torture known in this inferno of God's making, and you will give in to it. END
BEGIN NOW Or suppose that you are a good boy, drink nothing stronger than milk, and bemoan your hard lot; you, with your generous nature, will endure hardships that would drive a dog mad, and make a start, after long waiting, as deputy to some rascal or other in a hole of a place where the Government will fling you a thousand francs a year like the scraps that are thrown to the butcher's dog. END
BEGIN NOW Bark at thieves, plead the cause of the rich, send men of heart to the guillotine, that is your work! END
BEGIN NOW Many thanks! END
BEGIN NOW If you have no influence, you may rot in your provincial tribunal. END
BEGIN NOW At thirty you will be a Justice with twelve hundred francs a year (if you have not flung off the gown for good before then). END
BEGIN NOW By the time you are forty you may look to marry a miller's daughter, an heiress with some six thousand livres a year. END
BEGIN NOW Much obliged! END
BEGIN NOW If you have influence, you may possibly be a Public Prosecutor by the time you are thirty; with a salary of a thousand crowns, you could look to marry the mayor's daughter. END
BEGIN NOW Some petty piece of political trickery, such as mistaking Villele for Manuel in a bulletin (the names rhyme, and that quiets your conscience), and you will probably be a Procureur General by the time you are forty, with a chance of becoming a deputy. END
BEGIN NOW Please to observe, my dear boy, that our conscience will have been a little damaged in the process, and that we shall endure twenty years of drudgery and hidden poverty, and that our sisters are wearing Dian's livery. END
BEGIN NOW I have the honor to call your attention to another fact: to wit, that there are but twenty Procureurs Generaux at a time in all France, while there are some twenty thousand of you young men who aspire to that elevated position; that there are some mountebanks among you who would sell their family to screw their fortunes a peg higher. END
BEGIN NOW If this sort of thing sickens you, try another course. END
BEGIN NOW The Baron de Rastignac thinks of becoming an advocate, does he? END
BEGIN NOW There's a nice prospect for you! END
BEGIN NOW Ten years of drudgery straight away. END
BEGIN NOW You are obliged to live at the rate of a thousand francs a month; you must have a library of law books, live in chambers, go into society, go down on your knees to ask a solicitor for briefs, lick the dust off the floor of the Palais de Justice. END
BEGIN NOW If this kind of business led to anything, I should not say no; but just give me the names of five advocates here in Paris who by the time that they are fifty are making fifty thousand francs a year! END
BEGIN NOW Bah! END
BEGIN NOW I would sooner turn pirate on the high seas than have my soul shrivel up inside me like that. END
BEGIN NOW How will you find the capital? END
BEGIN NOW There is but one way, marry a woman who has money. END
BEGIN NOW There is no fun in it. END
BEGIN NOW Have you a mind to marry? END
BEGIN NOW You hang a stone around your neck; for if you marry for money, what becomes of our exalted notions of honor and so forth? END
BEGIN NOW You might as well fly in the face of social conventions at once. END
BEGIN NOW Is it nothing to crawl like a serpent before your wife, to lick her mother's feet, to descend to dirty actions that would sicken swine&mdash;faugh!&mdash;never mind if you at least make your fortune. END
BEGIN NOW But you will be as doleful as a dripstone if you marry for money. END
BEGIN NOW It is better to wrestle with men than to wrangle at home with your wife. END
BEGIN NOW You are at the crossway of the roads of life, my boy; choose your way. END
BEGIN NOW Travaux forces, forced labour. END
BEGIN NOW But you have chosen already. END
BEGIN NOW You have gone to see your cousin of Beauseant, and you have had an inkling of luxury; you have been to de Restaud's house, and in Father Goriot's daughter you have seen a glimpse of the Parisienne for the first time. END
BEGIN NOW That day you came back with a word written on your forehead. END
BEGIN NOW I knew it, I could read it&mdash;'_Success_!' END
BEGIN NOW Yes, success at any price. END
BEGIN NOW 'Bravo,' said I to myself, 'here is the sort of fellow for me.' END
BEGIN NOW You wanted money. END
BEGIN NOW Where was it all to come from? END
BEGIN NOW You have drained your sisters' little hoard (all brothers sponge more or less on their sisters). END
BEGIN NOW Those fifteen hundred francs of yours (got together, God knows how! END
BEGIN NOW in a country where there are more chestnuts than five-franc pieces) will slip away like soldiers after pillage. END
BEGIN NOW And, then, what will you do? END
BEGIN NOW Shall you begin to work? END
BEGIN NOW Work, or what you understand by work at this moment, means, for a man of Poiret's calibre, an old age in Mamma Vauquer's lodging-house. END
BEGIN NOW There are fifty thousand young men in your position at this moment, all bent as you are on solving one and the same problem&mdash;how to acquire a fortune rapidly. END
BEGIN NOW You are but a unit in that aggregate. END
BEGIN NOW You can guess, therefore, what efforts you must make, how desperate the struggle is. END
BEGIN NOW There are not fifty thousand good positions for you; you must fight and devour one another like spiders in a pot. END
BEGIN NOW Do you know how a man makes his way here? END
BEGIN NOW By brilliant genius or by skilful corruption. END
BEGIN NOW You must either cut your way through these masses of men like a cannon ball, or steal among them like a plague. END
BEGIN NOW Honesty is nothing to the purpose. END
BEGIN NOW Men bow before the power of genius; they hate it, and try to slander it, because genius does not divide the spoil; but if genius persists, they bow before it. END
BEGIN NOW To sum it all up in a phrase, if they fail to smother genius in the mud, they fall on their knees and worship it. END
BEGIN NOW Corruption is a great power in the world, and talent is scarce. END
BEGIN NOW So corruption is the weapon of superfluous mediocrity; you will be made to feel the point of it everywhere. END
BEGIN NOW You will see women who spend more than ten thousand francs a year on dress, while their husband's salary (his whole income) is six thousand francs. END
BEGIN NOW You will see officials buying estates on twelve thousand francs a year. END
BEGIN NOW You will see women who sell themselves body and soul to drive in a carriage belonging to the son of a peer of France, who has a right to drive in the middle rank at Longchamp. END
BEGIN NOW You have seen that poor simpleton of a Goriot obliged to meet a bill with his daughter's name at the back of it, though her husband has fifty thousand francs a year. END
BEGIN NOW I defy you to walk a couple of yards anywhere in Paris without stumbling on some infernal complication. END
BEGIN NOW I'll bet my head to a head of that salad that you will stir up a hornet's nest by taking a fancy to the first young, rich, and pretty woman you meet. END
BEGIN NOW They are all dodging the law, all at loggerheads with their husbands. END
BEGIN NOW If I were to begin to tell you all that vanity or necessity (virtue is not often mixed up in it, you may be sure), all that vanity and necessity drive them to do for lovers, finery, housekeeping, or children, I should never come to an end. END
BEGIN NOW So an honest man is the common enemy. END
BEGIN NOW But do you know what an honest man is? END
BEGIN NOW Here, in Paris, an honest man is the man who keeps his own counsel, and will not divide the plunder. END
BEGIN NOW I am not speaking now of those poor bond-slaves who do the work of the world without a reward for their toil&mdash;God Almighty's outcasts, I call them. END
BEGIN NOW Among them, I grant you, is virtue in all the flower of its stupidity, but poverty is no less their portion. END
BEGIN NOW At this moment, I think I see the long faces those good folk would pull if God played a practical joke on them and stayed away at the Last Judgment. END
BEGIN NOW Well, then, if you mean to make a fortune quickly, you must either be rich to begin with, or make people believe that you are rich. END
BEGIN NOW It is no use playing here except for high stakes; once take to low play, it is all up with you. END
BEGIN NOW If in the scores of professions that are open to you, there are ten men who rise very rapidly, people are sure to call them thieves. END
BEGIN NOW You can draw your own conclusions. END
BEGIN NOW Such is life. END
BEGIN NOW It is no cleaner than a kitchen; it reeks like a kitchen; and if you mean to cook your dinner, you must expect to soil your hands; the real art is in getting them clean again, and therein lies the whole morality of our epoch. END
BEGIN NOW If I take this tone in speaking of the world to you, I have the right to do so; I know it well. END
BEGIN NOW Do you think that I am blaming it? END
BEGIN NOW Far from it; the world has always been as it is now. END
BEGIN NOW Moralists' strictures will never change it. END
BEGIN NOW Mankind are not perfect, but one age is more or less hypocritical than another, and then simpletons say that its morality is high or low. END
BEGIN NOW I do not think that the rich are any worse than the poor; man is much the same, high or low, or wherever he is. END
BEGIN NOW In a million of these human cattle there may be half a score of bold spirits who rise above the rest, above the laws; I am one of them. END
BEGIN NOW And you, if you are cleverer than your fellows, make straight to your end, and hold your head high. END
BEGIN NOW But you must lay your account with envy and slander and mediocrity, and every man's hand will be against you. END
BEGIN NOW Napoleon met with a Minister of War, Aubry by name, who all but sent him to the colonies. END
BEGIN NOW Feel your pulse. END
BEGIN NOW Think whether you can get up morning after morning, strengthened in yesterday's purpose. END
BEGIN NOW In that case I will make you an offer that no one would decline. END
BEGIN NOW Listen attentively. END
BEGIN NOW You see, I have an idea of my own. END
BEGIN NOW My idea is to live a patriarchal life on a vast estate, say a hundred thousand acres, somewhere in the Southern States of America. END
BEGIN NOW I mean to be a planter, to have slaves, to make a few snug millions by selling my cattle, timber, and tobacco; I want to live an absolute monarch, and to do just as I please; to lead such a life as no one here in these squalid dens of lath and plaster ever imagines. END
BEGIN NOW I am a great poet; I do not write my poems, I feel them, and act them. END
BEGIN NOW At this moment I have fifty thousand francs, which might possibly buy forty negroes. END
BEGIN NOW I want two hundred thousand francs, because I want to have two hundred negroes to carry out my notions of the patriarachal life properly. END
BEGIN NOW Negroes, you see, are like a sort of family ready grown, and there are no inquisitive public prosecutors out there to interfere with you. END
BEGIN NOW That investment in ebony ought to mean three or four million francs in ten years' time. END
BEGIN NOW If I am successful, no one will ask me who I am. END
BEGIN NOW I shall be Mr. Four Millions, an American citizen. END
BEGIN NOW I shall be fifty years old by then, and sound and hearty still; I shall enjoy life after my own fashion. END
BEGIN NOW In two words, if I find you an heiress with a million, will you give me two hundred thousand francs? END
BEGIN NOW Twenty per cent commission, eh? END
BEGIN NOW Is that too much? END
BEGIN NOW Your little wife will be very much in love with you. END
BEGIN NOW Once married, you will show signs of uneasiness and remorse; for a couple of weeks you will be depressed. END
BEGIN NOW Then, some night after sundry grimacings, comes the confession, between two kisses, 'Two hundred thousand francs of debts, my darling!' END
BEGIN NOW This sort of farce is played every day in Paris, and by young men of the highest fashion. END
BEGIN NOW When a young wife has given her heart, she will not refuse her purse. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps you are thinking that you will lose the money for good? END
BEGIN NOW Not you. END
BEGIN NOW You will make two hundred thousand francs again by some stroke of business. END
BEGIN NOW With your capital and your brains you should be able to accumulate as large a fortune as you could wish. END
BEGIN NOW _Ergo_, in six months you will have made your own fortune, and our old friend Vautrin's, and made an amiable woman very happy, to say nothing of your people at home, who must blow on their fingers to warm them, in the winter, for lack of firewood. END
BEGIN NOW You need not be surprised at my proposal, nor at the demand I make. END
BEGIN NOW Forty-seven out of every sixty great matches here in Paris are made after just such a bargain as this. END
BEGIN NOW The Chamber of Notaries compels my gentleman to&mdash;- What must I do? END
BEGIN NOW said Rastignac, eagerly interrupting Vautrin's speech. END
BEGIN NOW Next to nothing, returned the other, with a slight involuntary movement, the suppressed exultation of the angler when he feels a bite at the end of his line. END
BEGIN NOW Follow me carefully! END
BEGIN NOW The heart of a girl whose life is wretched and unhappy is a sponge that will thirstily absorb love; a dry sponge that swells at the first drop of sentiment. END
BEGIN NOW If you pay court to a young girl whose existence is a compound of loneliness, despair, and poverty, and who has no suspicion that she will come into a fortune, good Lord! END
BEGIN NOW it is quint and quatorze at piquet; it is knowing the numbers of the lottery before-hand; it is speculating in the funds when you have news from a sure source; it is building up a marriage on an indestructible foundation. END
BEGIN NOW The girl may come in for millions, and she will fling them, as if they were so many pebbles, at your feet. END
BEGIN NOW 'Take it, my beloved! END
BEGIN NOW Take it, Alfred, Adolphe, Eugene!' END
BEGIN NOW or whoever it was that showed his sense by sacrificing himself for her. END
BEGIN NOW And as for sacrificing himself, this is how I understand it. END
BEGIN NOW You sell a coat that is getting shabby, so that you can take her to the _Cadran bleu_, treat her to mushrooms on toast, and then go to the Ambigu-Comique in the evening; you pawn your watch to buy her a shawl. END
BEGIN NOW I need not remind you of the fiddle-faddle sentimentality that goes down so well with all women; you spill a few drops of water on your stationery, for instance; those are the tears you shed while far away from her. END
BEGIN NOW You look to me as if you were perfectly acquainted with the argot of the heart. END
BEGIN NOW Paris, you see, is like a forest in the New World, where you have to deal with a score of varieties of savages&mdash;Illinois and Hurons, who live on the proceed of their social hunting. END
BEGIN NOW You are a hunter of millions; you set your snares; you use lures and nets; there are many ways of hunting. END
BEGIN NOW Some hunt heiresses, others a legacy; some fish for souls, yet others sell their clients, bound hand and foot. END
BEGIN NOW Every one who comes back from the chase with his game-bag well filled meets with a warm welcome in good society. END
BEGIN NOW In justice to this hospitable part of the world, it must be said that you have to do with the most easy and good-natured of great cities. END
BEGIN NOW If the proud aristocracies of the rest of Europe refuse admittance among their ranks to a disreputable millionaire, Paris stretches out a hand to him, goes to his banquets, eats his dinners, and hobnobs with his infamy. END
BEGIN NOW But where is such a girl to be found? END
BEGIN NOW asked Eugene. END
BEGIN NOW Under your eyes; she is yours already. END
BEGIN NOW Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Victorine? END
BEGIN NOW Precisely. END
BEGIN NOW And what was that you said? END
BEGIN NOW She is in love with you already, your little Baronne de Rastignac! END
BEGIN NOW She has not a penny, Eugene continued, much mystified. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW now we are coming to it! END
BEGIN NOW Just another word or two, and it will all be clear enough. END
BEGIN NOW Her father, Taillefer, is an old scoundrel; it is said that he murdered one of his friends at the time of the Revolution. END
BEGIN NOW He is one of your comedians that sets up to have opinions of his own. END
BEGIN NOW He is a banker&mdash;senior partner in the house of Frederic Taillefer and Company. END
BEGIN NOW He has one son, and means to leave all he has to the boy, to the prejudice of Victorine. END
BEGIN NOW For my part, I don't like to see injustice of this sort. END
BEGIN NOW I am like Don Quixote, I have a fancy for defending the weak against the strong. END
BEGIN NOW If it should please God to take that youth away from him, Taillefer would have only his daughter left; he would want to leave his money to some one or other; an absurd notion, but it is only human nature, and he is not likely to have any more children, as I know. END
BEGIN NOW Victorine is gentle and amiable; she will soon twist her father round her fingers, and set his head spinning like a German top by plying him with sentiment! END
BEGIN NOW She will be too much touched by your devotion to forget you; you will marry her. END
BEGIN NOW I mean to play Providence for you, and Providence is to do my will. END
BEGIN NOW I have a friend whom I have attached closely to myself, a colonel in the Army of the Loire, who has just been transferred into the _garde royale_. END
BEGIN NOW He has taken my advice and turned ultra-royalist; he is not one of those fools who never change their opinions. END
BEGIN NOW Of all pieces of advice, my cherub, I would give you this&mdash;don't stick to your opinions any more than to your words. END
BEGIN NOW If any one asks you for them, let him have them&mdash;at a price. END
BEGIN NOW A man who prides himself on going in a straight line through life is an idiot who believes in infallibility. END
BEGIN NOW There are no such things as principles; there are only events, and there are no laws but those of expediency: a man of talent accepts events and the circumstances in which he finds himself, and turns everything to his own ends. END
BEGIN NOW If laws and principles were fixed and invariable, nations would not change them as readily as we change our shirts. END
BEGIN NOW The individual is not obliged to be more particular than the nation. END
BEGIN NOW A man whose services to France have been of the very slightest is a fetich looked on with superstitious awe because he has always seen everything in red; but he is good, at the most, to be put into the Museum of Arts and Crafts, among the automatic machines, and labeled La Fayette; while the prince at whom everybody flings a stone, the man who despises humanity so much that he spits as many oaths as he is asked for in the face of humanity, saved France from being torn in pieces at the Congress of Vienna; and they who should have given him laurels fling mud at him. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW I know something of affairs, I can tell you; I have the secrets of many men! END
BEGIN NOW Enough. END
BEGIN NOW When I find three minds in agreement as to the application of a principle, I shall have a fixed and immovable opinion&mdash;I shall have to wait a long while first. END
BEGIN NOW In the Tribunals you will not find three judges of the same opinion on a single point of law. END
BEGIN NOW To return to the man I was telling you of. END
BEGIN NOW He would crucify Jesus Christ again, if I bade him. END
BEGIN NOW At a word from his old chum Vautrin he will pick a quarrel with a scamp that will not send so much as five francs to his sister, poor girl, and (here Vautrin rose to his feet and stood like a fencing-master about to lunge)&mdash; turn him off into the dark! END
BEGIN NOW he added. END
BEGIN NOW How frightful! END
BEGIN NOW said Eugene. END
BEGIN NOW You do not really mean it? END
BEGIN NOW M. Vautrin, you are joking! END
BEGIN NOW There! END
BEGIN NOW there! END
BEGIN NOW Keep cool! END
BEGIN NOW said the other. END
BEGIN NOW Don't behave like a baby. END
BEGIN NOW But if you find any amusement in it, be indignant, flare up! END
BEGIN NOW Say that I am a scoundrel, a rascal, a rogue, a bandit; but do not call me a blackleg nor a spy! END
BEGIN NOW There, out with it, fire away! END
BEGIN NOW I forgive you; it is quite natural at your age. END
BEGIN NOW I was like that myself once. END
BEGIN NOW Only remember this, you will do worse things yourself some day. END
BEGIN NOW You will flirt with some pretty woman and take her money. END
BEGIN NOW You have thought of that, of course, said Vautrin, for how are you to succeed unless love is laid under contribution? END
BEGIN NOW There are no two ways about virtue, my dear student; it either is, or it is not. END
BEGIN NOW Talk of doing penance for your sins! END
BEGIN NOW It is a nice system of business, when you pay for your crime by an act of contrition! END
BEGIN NOW You seduce a woman that you may set your foot on such and such a rung of the social ladder; you sow dissension among the children of a family; you descend, in short, to every base action that can be committed at home or abroad, to gain your own ends for your own pleasure or your profit; and can you imagine that these are acts of faith, hope, or charity? END
BEGIN NOW How is it that a dandy, who in a night has robbed a boy of half his fortune, gets only a couple of months in prison; while a poor devil who steals a banknote for a thousand francs, with aggravating circumstances, is condemned to penal servitude? END
BEGIN NOW Those are your laws. END
BEGIN NOW Not a single provision but lands you in some absurdity. END
BEGIN NOW That man with yellow gloves and a golden tongue commits many a murder; he sheds no blood, but he drains his victim's veins as surely; a desperado forces open a door with a crowbar, dark deeds both of them! END
BEGIN NOW You yourself will do every one of those things that I suggest to you to-day, bar the bloodshed. END
BEGIN NOW Do you believe that there is any absolute standard in this world? END
BEGIN NOW Despise mankind and find out the meshes that you can slip through in the net of the Code. END
BEGIN NOW The secret of a great success for which you are at a loss to account is a crime that has never been found out, because it was properly executed. END
BEGIN NOW Silence, sir! END
BEGIN NOW I will not hear any more; you make me doubt myself. END
BEGIN NOW At this moment my sentiments are all my science. END
BEGIN NOW Just as you please, my fine fellow; I did think you were so weak-minded, said Vautrin, I shall say no more about it. END
BEGIN NOW One last word, however, and he looked hard at the student&mdash; you have my secret, he said. END
BEGIN NOW A young man who refuses your offer knows that he must forget it. END
BEGIN NOW Quite right, quite right; I am glad to hear you say so. END
BEGIN NOW Somebody else might not be so scrupulous, you see. END
BEGIN NOW Keep in mind what I want to do for you. END
BEGIN NOW I will give you a fortnight. END
BEGIN NOW The offer is still open. END
BEGIN NOW What a head of iron the man has! END
BEGIN NOW said Eugene to himself, as he watched Vautrin walk unconcernedly away with his cane under his arm. END
BEGIN NOW Yet de Beauseant said as much more gracefully; he has only stated the case in cruder language. END
BEGIN NOW He would tear my heart with claws of steel. END
BEGIN NOW What made me think of going to de Nucingen? END
BEGIN NOW He guessed my motives before I knew them myself. END
BEGIN NOW To sum it up, that outlaw has told me more about virtue than all I have learned from men and books. END
BEGIN NOW If virtue admits of no compromises, I have certainly robbed my sisters, he said, throwing down the bags on the table. END
BEGIN NOW He sat down again and fell, unconscious of his surroundings, into deep thought. END
BEGIN NOW To be faithful to an ideal of virtue! END
BEGIN NOW A heroic martyrdom! END
BEGIN NOW Pshaw! END
BEGIN NOW every one believes in virtue, but who is virtuous? END
BEGIN NOW Nations have made an idol of Liberty, but what nation on the face of the earth is free? END
BEGIN NOW My youth is still like a blue and cloudless sky. END
BEGIN NOW If I set myself to obtain wealth or power, does it mean that I must make up my mind to lie, and fawn, and cringe, and swagger, and flatter, and dissemble? END
BEGIN NOW To consent to be the servant of others who have likewise fawned, and lied, and flattered? END
BEGIN NOW Must I cringe to them before I can hope to be their accomplice? END
BEGIN NOW Well, then, I decline. END
BEGIN NOW I mean to work nobly and with a single heart. END
BEGIN NOW I will work day and night; I will owe my fortune to nothing but my own exertions. END
BEGIN NOW It may be the slowest of all roads to success, but I shall lay my head on the pillow at night untroubled by evil thoughts. END
BEGIN NOW Is there a greater thing than this&mdash;to look back over your life and know that it is stainless as a lily? END
BEGIN NOW I and my life are like a young man and his betrothed. END
BEGIN NOW Vautrin has put before me all that comes after ten years of marriage. END
BEGIN NOW The devil! END
BEGIN NOW my head is swimming. END
BEGIN NOW I do not want to think at all; the heart is a sure guide. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene was roused from his musings by the voice of the stout Sylvie, who announced that the tailor had come, and Eugene therefore made his appearance before the man with the two money bags, and was not ill pleased that it should be so. END
BEGIN NOW When he had tried on his dress suit, he put on his new morning costume, which completely metamorphosed him. END
BEGIN NOW I am quite equal to M. de Trailles, he said to himself. END
BEGIN NOW In short, I look like a gentleman. END
BEGIN NOW You asked me, sir, if I knew the houses where de Nucingen goes, Father Goriot's voice spoke from the doorway of Eugene's room. END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Very well then, she is going to the Marechale Carigliano's ball on Monday. END
BEGIN NOW If you can manage to be there, I shall hear from you whether my two girls enjoyed themselves, and how they were dressed, and all about it in fact. END
BEGIN NOW How did you find that out, my good Goriot? END
BEGIN NOW said Eugene, putting a chair by the fire for his visitor. END
BEGIN NOW Her maid told me. END
BEGIN NOW I hear all about their doings from Therese and Constance, he added gleefully. END
BEGIN NOW The old man looked like a lover who is still young enough to be made happy by the discovery of some little stratagem which brings him information of his lady-love without her knowledge. END
BEGIN NOW _You_ will see them both! END
BEGIN NOW he said, giving artless expression to a pang of jealousy. END
BEGIN NOW I do not know, answered Eugene. END
BEGIN NOW I will go to de Beauseant and ask her for an introduction to the Marechale. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene felt a thrill of pleasure at the thought of appearing before the Vicomtesse, dressed as henceforward he always meant to be. END
BEGIN NOW The abysses of the human heart, in the moralists' phrase, are only insidious thoughts, involuntary promptings of personal interest. END
BEGIN NOW The instinct of enjoyment turns the scale; those rapid changes of purpose which have furnished the text for so much rhetoric are calculations prompted by the hope of pleasure. END
BEGIN NOW Rastignac beholding himself well dressed and impeccable as to gloves and boots, forgot his virtuous resolutions. END
BEGIN NOW Youth, moreover, when bent upon wrongdoing does not dare to behold himself in the mirror of consciousness; mature age has seen itself; and therein lies the whole difference between these two phases of life. END
BEGIN NOW A friendship between Eugene and his neighbor, Father Goriot, had been growing up for several days past. END
BEGIN NOW This secret friendship and the antipathy that the student had begun to entertain for Vautrin arose from the same psychological causes. END
BEGIN NOW The bold philosopher who shall investigate the effects of mental action upon the physical world will doubtless find more than one proof of the material nature of our sentiments in other animals. END
BEGIN NOW What physiognomist is as quick to discern character as a dog is to discover from a stranger's face whether this is a friend or no? END
BEGIN NOW Those by-words&mdash; atoms, affinities &mdash;are facts surviving in modern languages for the confusion of philosophic wiseacres who amuse themselves by winnowing the chaff of language to find its grammatical roots. END
BEGIN NOW We _feel_ that we are loved. END
BEGIN NOW Our sentiments make themselves felt in everything, even at a great distance. END
BEGIN NOW A letter is a living soul, and so faithful an echo of the voice that speaks in it, that finer natures look upon a letter as one of love's most precious treasures. END
BEGIN NOW Father Goriot's affection was of the instinctive order, a canine affection raised to a sublime pitch; he had scented compassion in the air, and the kindly respect and youthful sympathy in the student's heart. END
BEGIN NOW This friendship had, however, scarcely reached the stage at which confidences are made. END
BEGIN NOW Though Eugene had spoken of his wish to meet de Nucingen, it was not because he counted on the old man to introduce him to her house, for he hoped that his own audacity might stand him in good stead. END
BEGIN NOW All that Father Goriot had said as yet about his daughters had referred to the remarks that the student had made so freely in public on that day of the two visits. END
BEGIN NOW How could you think that de Restaud bore you a grudge for mentioning my name? END
BEGIN NOW he had said on the day following that scene at dinner. END
BEGIN NOW My daughters are very fond of me; I am a happy father; but my sons-in-law have behaved badly to me, and rather than make trouble between my darlings and their husbands, I choose to see my daughters secretly. END
BEGIN NOW Fathers who can see their daughters at any time have no idea of all the pleasure that all this mystery gives me; I cannot always see mine when I wish, do you understand? END
BEGIN NOW So when it is fine I walk out in the Champs-Elysees, after finding out from their waiting-maids whether my daughters mean to go out. END
BEGIN NOW I wait near the entrance; my heart beats fast when the carriages begin to come; I admire them in their dresses, and as they pass they give me a little smile, and it seems as if everything was lighted up for me by a ray of bright sunlight. END
BEGIN NOW I wait, for they always go back the same way, and then I see them again; the fresh air has done them good and brought color into their cheeks; all about me people say, 'What a beautiful woman that is!' END
BEGIN NOW and it does my heart good to hear them. END
BEGIN NOW Are they not my own flesh and blood? END
BEGIN NOW I love the very horses that draw them; I envy the little lap-dog on their knees. END
BEGIN NOW Their happiness is my life. END
BEGIN NOW Every one loves after his own fashion, and mine does no one any harm; why should people trouble their heads about me? END
BEGIN NOW I am happy in my own way. END
BEGIN NOW Is there any law against going to see my girls in the evening when they are going out to a ball? END
BEGIN NOW And what a disappointment it is when I get there too late, and am told that 'Madame has gone out!' END
BEGIN NOW Once I waited till three o'clock in the morning for Nasie; I had not seen her for two whole days. END
BEGIN NOW I was so pleased, that it was almost too much for me! END
BEGIN NOW Please do not speak of me unless it is to say how good my daughters are to me. END
BEGIN NOW They are always wanting to heap presents upon me, but I will not have it. END
BEGIN NOW 'Just keep your money,' I tell them. END
BEGIN NOW 'What should I do with it? END
BEGIN NOW I want nothing.' END
BEGIN NOW And what am I, sir, after all? END
BEGIN NOW An old carcase, whose soul is always where my daughters are. END
BEGIN NOW When you have seen de Nucingen, tell me which you like the most, said the old man after a moment's pause, while Eugene put the last touches to his toilette. END
BEGIN NOW The student was about to go out to walk in the Garden of the Tuileries until the hour when he could venture to appear in de Beauseant's drawing-room. END
BEGIN NOW That walk was a turning-point in Eugene's career. END
BEGIN NOW Several women noticed him; he looked so handsome, so young, and so well dressed. END
BEGIN NOW This almost admiring attention gave a new turn to his thoughts. END
BEGIN NOW He forgot his sisters and the aunt who had robbed herself for him; he no longer remembered his own virtuous scruples. END
BEGIN NOW He had seen hovering above his head the fiend so easy to mistake for an angel, the Devil with rainbow wings, who scatters rubies, and aims his golden shafts at palace fronts, who invests women with purple, and thrones with a glory that dazzles the eyes of fools till they forget the simple origins of royal dominion; he had heard the rustle of that Vanity whose tinsel seems to us to be the symbol of power. END
BEGIN NOW However cynical Vautrin's words had been, they had made an impression on his mind, as the sordid features of the old crone who whispers, A lover, and gold in torrents, remain engraven on a young girl's memory. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene lounged about the walks till it was nearly five o'clock, then he went to de Beauseant, and received one of the terrible blows against which young hearts are defenceless. END
BEGIN NOW Hitherto the Vicomtesse had received him with the kindly urbanity, the bland grace of manner that is the result of fine breeding, but is only complete when it comes from the heart. END
BEGIN NOW To-day de Beauseant bowed constrainedly, and spoke curtly: M. de Rastignac, I cannot possibly see you, at least not at this moment. END
BEGIN NOW I am engaged... An observer, and Rastignac instantly became an observer, could read the whole history, the character and customs of caste, in the phrase, in the tones of her voice, in her glance and bearing. END
BEGIN NOW He caught a glimpse of the iron hand beneath the velvet glove&mdash;the personality, the egoism beneath the manner, the wood beneath the varnish. END
BEGIN NOW In short, he heard that unmistakable I THE KING that issues from the plumed canopy of the throne, and finds its last echo under the crest of the simplest gentleman. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene had trusted too implicitly to the generosity of a woman; he could not believe in her haughtiness. END
BEGIN NOW Like all the unfortunate, he had subscribed, in all good faith, the generous compact which should bind the benefactor to the recipient, and the first article in that bond, between two large-hearted natures, is a perfect equality. END
BEGIN NOW The kindness which knits two souls together is as rare, as divine, and as little understood as the passion of love, for both love and kindness are the lavish generosity of noble natures. END
BEGIN NOW Rastignac was set upon going to the Duchesse de Carigliano's ball, so he swallowed down this rebuff. END
BEGIN NOW Madame, he faltered out, I would not have come to trouble you about a trifling matter; be so kind as to permit me to see you later, I can wait. END
BEGIN NOW Very well, come and dine with me, she said, a little confused by the harsh way in which she had spoken, for this lady was as genuinely kind-hearted as she was high-born. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene was touched by this sudden relenting, but none the less he said to himself as he went away, Crawl in the dust, put up with every kind of treatment. END
BEGIN NOW What must the rest of the world be like when one of the kindest of women forgets all her promises of befriending me in a moment, and tosses me aside like an old shoe? END
BEGIN NOW So it is every one for himself? END
BEGIN NOW It is true that her house is not a shop, and I have put myself in the wrong by needing her help. END
BEGIN NOW You should cut your way through the world like a cannon ball, as Vautrin said. END
BEGIN NOW But the student's bitter thoughts were soon dissipated by the pleasure which he promised himself in this dinner with the Vicomtesse. END
BEGIN NOW Fate seemed to determine that the smallest accidents in his life should combine to urge him into a career, which the terrible sphinx of the Maison Vauquer had described as a field of battle where you must either slay or be slain, and cheat to avoid being cheated. END
BEGIN NOW You leave your conscience and your heart at the barriers, and wear a mask on entering into this game of grim earnest, where, as in ancient Sparta, you must snatch your prize without being detected if you would deserve the crown. END
BEGIN NOW On his return he found the Vicomtesse gracious and kindly, as she had always been to him. END
BEGIN NOW They went together to the dining-room, where the Vicomte was waiting for his wife. END
BEGIN NOW In the time of the Restoration the luxury of the table was carried, as is well known, to the highest degree, and M. de Beauseant, like many jaded men of the world, had few pleasures left but those of good cheer; in this matter, in fact, he was a gourmand of the schools of Louis XVIII. END
BEGIN NOW and of the Duc d'Escars, and luxury was supplemented by splendor. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene, dining for the first time in a house where the traditions of grandeur had descended through many generations, had never seen any spectacle like this that now met his eyes. END
BEGIN NOW In the time of the Empire, balls had always ended with a supper, because the officers who took part in them must be fortified for immediate service, and even in Paris might be called upon to leave the ballroom for the battlefield. END
BEGIN NOW This arrangement had gone out of fashion under the Monarchy, and Eugene had so far only been asked to dances. END
BEGIN NOW The self-possession which pre-eminently distinguished him in later life already stood him in good stead, and he did not betray his amazement. END
BEGIN NOW Yet as he saw for the first time the finely wrought silver plate, the completeness of every detail, the sumptuous dinner, noiselessly served, it was difficult for such an ardent imagination not to prefer this life of studied and refined luxury to the hardships of the life which he had chosen only that morning. END
BEGIN NOW His thoughts went back for a moment to the lodging-house, and with a feeling of profound loathing, he vowed to himself that at New Year he would go; prompted at least as much by a desire to live among cleaner surroundings as by a wish to shake off Vautrin, whose huge hand he seemed to feel on his shoulder at that moment. END
BEGIN NOW When you consider the numberless forms, clamorous or mute, that corruption takes in Paris, common-sense begins to wonder what mental aberration prompted the State to establish great colleges and schools there, and assemble young men in the capital; how it is that pretty women are respected, or that the gold coin displayed in the money-changer's wooden saucers does not take to itself wings in the twinkling of an eye; and when you come to think further, how comparatively few cases of crime there are, and to count up the misdemeanors committed by youth, is there not a certain amount of respect due to these patient Tantaluses who wrestle with themselves and nearly always come off victorious? END
BEGIN NOW The struggles of the poor student in Paris, if skilfully drawn, would furnish a most dramatic picture of modern civilization. END
BEGIN NOW In vain de Beauseant looked at Eugene as if asking him to speak; the student was tongue-tied in the Vicomte's presence. END
BEGIN NOW Are you going to take me to the Italiens this evening? END
BEGIN NOW the Vicomtesse asked her husband. END
BEGIN NOW You cannot doubt that I should obey you with pleasure, he answered, and there was a sarcastic tinge in his politeness which Eugene did not detect, but I ought to go to meet some one at the Varietes. END
BEGIN NOW His mistress, said she to herself. END
BEGIN NOW Then, is not Ajuda coming for you this evening? END
BEGIN NOW inquired the Vicomte. END
BEGIN NOW No, she answered, petulantly. END
BEGIN NOW Very well, then, if you really must have an arm, take that of M. de Rastignac. END
BEGIN NOW The Vicomtess turned to Eugene with a smile. END
BEGIN NOW That would be a very compromising step for you, she said. END
BEGIN NOW 'A Frenchman loves danger, because in danger there is glory,' to quote M. de Chateaubriand, said Rastignac, with a bow. END
BEGIN NOW A few moments later he was sitting beside de Beauseant in a brougham, that whirled them through the streets of Paris to a fashionable theatre. END
BEGIN NOW It seemed to him that some fairy magic had suddenly transported him into a box facing the stage. END
BEGIN NOW All the lorgnettes of the house were pointed at him as he entered, and at the Vicomtesse in her charming toilette. END
BEGIN NOW He went from enchantment to enchantment. END
BEGIN NOW You must talk to me, you know, said de Beauseant. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW look! END
BEGIN NOW There is de Nucingen in the third box from ours. END
BEGIN NOW Her sister and M. de Trailles are on the other side. END
BEGIN NOW The Vicomtesse glanced as she spoke at the box where Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW de Rochefide should have been; M. d'Ajuda was not there, and de Beauseant's face lighted up in a marvelous way. END
BEGIN NOW She is charming, said Eugene, after looking at de Nucingen. END
BEGIN NOW She has white eyelashes. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, but she has such a pretty slender figure! END
BEGIN NOW Her hands are large. END
BEGIN NOW Such beautiful eyes! END
BEGIN NOW Her face is long. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, but length gives distinction. END
BEGIN NOW It is lucky for her that she has some distinction in her face. END
BEGIN NOW Just see how she fidgets with her opera-glass! END
BEGIN NOW The Goriot blood shows itself in every movement, said the Vicomtesse, much to Eugene's astonishment. END
BEGIN NOW Indeed, de Beauseant seemed to be engaged in making a survey of the house, and to be unconscious of Nucingen's existence; but no movement made by the latter was lost upon the Vicomtesse. END
BEGIN NOW The house was full of the loveliest women in Paris, so that Delphine de Nucingen was not a little flattered to receive the undivided attention of de Beauseant's young, handsome, and well-dressed cousin, who seemed to have no eyes for any one else. END
BEGIN NOW If you look at her so persistently, you will make people talk, M. de Rastignac. END
BEGIN NOW You will never succeed if you fling yourself at any one's head like that. END
BEGIN NOW My dear cousin, said Eugene, you have protected me indeed so far, and now if you would complete your work, I only ask of you a favor which will cost you but little, and be of very great service to me. END
BEGIN NOW I have lost my heart. END
BEGIN NOW Already! END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW And to that woman! END
BEGIN NOW How could I aspire to find any one else to listen to me? END
BEGIN NOW he asked, with a keen glance at his cousin. END
BEGIN NOW Her Grace the Duchesse de Carigliano is a friend of the Duchesse de Berri, he went on, after a pause; you are sure to see her, will you be so kind as to present me to her, and to take me to her ball on Monday? END
BEGIN NOW I shall meet de Nucingen there, and enter into my first skirmish. END
BEGIN NOW Willingly, she said. END
BEGIN NOW If you have a liking for her already, your affairs of the heart are like to prosper. END
BEGIN NOW That is de Marsay over there in the Princesse Galathionne's box. END
BEGIN NOW de Nucingen is racked with jealousy. END
BEGIN NOW There is no better time for approaching a woman, especially if she happens to be a banker's wife. END
BEGIN NOW All those ladies of the Chaussee-d'Antin love revenge. END
BEGIN NOW Then, what would you do yourself in such a case? END
BEGIN NOW I should suffer in silence. END
BEGIN NOW At this point the Marquis d'Ajuda appeared in de Beauseant's box. END
BEGIN NOW I have made a muddle of my affairs to come to you, he said, and I am telling you about it, so that it may not be a sacrifice. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene saw the glow of joy on the Vicomtesse's face, and knew that this was love, and learned the difference between love and the affectations of Parisian coquetry. END
BEGIN NOW He admired his cousin, grew mute, and yielded his place to M. d'Ajuda with a sigh. END
BEGIN NOW How noble, how sublime a woman is when she loves like that! END
BEGIN NOW he said to himself. END
BEGIN NOW And _he_ could forsake her for a doll! END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW how could any one forsake her? END
BEGIN NOW There was a boy's passionate indignation in his heart. END
BEGIN NOW He could have flung himself at de Beauseant's feet; he longed for the power of the devil if he could snatch her away and hide her in his heart, as an eagle snatches up some white yearling from the plains and bears it to its eyrie. END
BEGIN NOW It was humiliating to him to think that in all this gallery of fair pictures he had not one picture of his own. END
BEGIN NOW To have a mistress and an almost royal position is a sign of power, he said to himself. END
BEGIN NOW And he looked at de Nucingen as a man measures another who has insulted him. END
BEGIN NOW The Vicomtesse turned to him, and the expression of her eyes thanked him a thousand times for his discretion. END
BEGIN NOW The first act came to an end just then. END
BEGIN NOW Do you know de Nucingen well enough to present M. de Rastignac to her? END
BEGIN NOW she asked of the Marquis d'Ajuda. END
BEGIN NOW She will be delighted, said the Marquis. END
BEGIN NOW The handsome Portuguese rose as he spoke and took the student's arm, and in another moment Eugene found himself in de Nucingen's box. END
BEGIN NOW Madame, said the Marquis, I have the honor of presenting to you the Chevalier Eugene de Rastignac; he is a cousin of de Beauseant's. END
BEGIN NOW You have made so deep an impression upon him, that I thought I would fill up the measure of his happiness by bringing him nearer to his divinity. END
BEGIN NOW Words spoken half jestingly to cover their somewhat disrespectful import; but such an implication, if carefully disguised, never gives offence to a woman. END
BEGIN NOW de Nucingen smiled, and offered Eugene the place which her husband had just left. END
BEGIN NOW I do not venture to suggest that you should stay with me, monsieur, she said. END
BEGIN NOW Those who are so fortunate as to be in de Beauseant's company do not desire to leave it. END
BEGIN NOW Madame, Eugene said, lowering his voice, I think that to please my cousin I should remain with you. END
BEGIN NOW Before my lord Marquis came we were speaking of you and of your exceedingly distinguished appearance, he added aloud. END
BEGIN NOW M. d'Ajuda turned and left them. END
BEGIN NOW Are you really going to stay with me, monsieur? END
BEGIN NOW asked the Baroness. END
BEGIN NOW Then we shall make each other's acquaintance. END
BEGIN NOW de Restaud told me about you, and has made me anxious to meet you. END
BEGIN NOW She must be very insincere, then, for she has shut her door on me. END
BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW Madame, I will tell you honestly the reason why; but I must crave your indulgence before confiding such a secret to you. END
BEGIN NOW I am your father's neighbor; I had no idea that de Restaud was his daughter. END
BEGIN NOW I was rash enough to mention his name; I meant no harm, but I annoyed your sister and her husband very much. END
BEGIN NOW You cannot think how severely the Duchesse de Langeais and my cousin blamed this apostasy on a daughter's part, as a piece of bad taste. END
BEGIN NOW I told them all about it, and they both burst out laughing. END
BEGIN NOW Then de Beauseant made some comparison between you and your sister, speaking in high terms of you, and saying how very fond you were of my neighbor, M. Goriot. END
BEGIN NOW And, indeed, how could you help loving him? END
BEGIN NOW He adores you so passionately that I am jealous already. END
BEGIN NOW We talked about you this morning for two hours. END
BEGIN NOW So this evening I was quite full of all that your father had told me, and while I was dining with my cousin I said that you could not be as beautiful as affectionate. END
BEGIN NOW de Beauseant meant to gratify such warm admiration, I think, when she brought me here, telling me, in her gracious way, that I should see you. END
BEGIN NOW Then, even now, I owe you a debt of gratitude, monsieur, said the banker's wife. END
BEGIN NOW We shall be quite old friends in a little while. END
BEGIN NOW Although a friendship with you could not be like an ordinary friendship, said Rastignac; I should never wish to be your friend. END
BEGIN NOW Such stereotyped phrases as these, in the mouths of beginners, possess an unfailing charm for women, and are insipid only when read coldly; for a young man's tone, glance and attitude give a surpassing eloquence to the banal phrases. END
BEGIN NOW de Nucingen thought that Rastignac was adorable. END
BEGIN NOW Then, woman-like, being at a loss how to reply to the student's outspoken admiration, she answered a previous remark. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, it is very wrong of my sister to treat our poor father as she does, she said; he has been a Providence to us. END
BEGIN NOW It was not until M. de Nucingen positively ordered me only to receive him in the mornings that I yielded the point. END
BEGIN NOW But I have been unhappy about it for a long while; I have shed many tears over it. END
BEGIN NOW This violence to my feelings, with my husband's brutal treatment, have been two causes of my unhappy married life. END
BEGIN NOW There is certainly no woman in Paris whose lot seems more enviable than mine, and yet, in reality, there is not one so much to be pitied. END
BEGIN NOW You will think I must be out of my senses to talk to you like this; but you know my father, and I cannot regard you as a stranger. END
BEGIN NOW You will find no one, said Eugene, who longs as eagerly as I do to be yours. END
BEGIN NOW What do all women seek? END
BEGIN NOW Happiness. END
BEGIN NOW (He answered his own question in low, vibrating tones.) END
BEGIN NOW And if happiness for a woman means that she is to be loved and adored, to have a friend to whom she can pour out her wishes, her fancies, her sorrows and joys; to whom she can lay bare her heart and soul, and all her fair defects and her gracious virtues, without fear of a betrayal; believe me, the devotion and the warmth that never fails can only be found in the heart of a young man who, at a bare sign from you, would go to his death, who neither knows nor cares to know anything as yet of the world, because you will be all the world to him. END
BEGIN NOW I myself, you see (you will laugh at my simplicity), have just come from a remote country district; I am quite new to this world of Paris; I have only known true and loving hearts; and I made up my mind that here I should find no love. END
BEGIN NOW Then I chanced to meet my cousin, and to see my cousin's heart from very near; I have divined the inexhaustible treasures of passion, and, like Cherubino, I am the lover of all women, until the day comes when I find _the_ woman to whom I may devote myself. END
BEGIN NOW As soon as I saw you, as soon as I came into the theatre this evening, I felt myself borne towards you as if by the current of a stream. END
BEGIN NOW I had so often thought of you already, but I had never dreamed that you would be so beautiful! END
BEGIN NOW de Beauseant told me that I must not look so much at you. END
BEGIN NOW She does not know the charm of your red lips, your fair face, nor see how soft your eyes are.... END
BEGIN NOW I also am beginning to talk nonsense; but let me talk. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing pleases a woman better than to listen to such whispered words as these; the most puritanical among them listens even when she ought not to reply to them; and Rastignac, having once begun, continued to pour out his story, dropping his voice, that she might lean and listen; and de Nucingen, smiling, glanced from time to time at de Marsay, who still sat in the Princesse Galathionne's box. END
BEGIN NOW Rastignac did not leave de Nucingen till her husband came to take her home. END
BEGIN NOW Madame, Eugene said, I shall have the pleasure of calling upon you before the Duchesse de Carigliano's ball. END
BEGIN NOW If Matame infites you to come, said the Baron, a thickset Alsatian, with indications of a sinister cunning in his full-moon countenance, you are quide sure of being well receifed. END
BEGIN NOW My affairs seem to be in a promising way, said Eugene to himself.&mdash; 'Can you love me?' END
BEGIN NOW I asked her, and she did not resent it. END
BEGIN NOW The bit is in the horse's mouth, and I have only to mount and ride; and with that he went to pay his respects to de Beauseant, who was leaving the theatre on d'Ajuda's arm. END
BEGIN NOW The student did not know that the Baroness' thoughts had been wandering; that she was even then expecting a letter from de Marsay, one of those letters that bring about a rupture that rends the soul; so, happy in his delusion, Eugene went with the Vicomtesse to the peristyle, where people were waiting till their carriages were announced. END
BEGIN NOW That cousin of yours is hardly recognizable for the same man, said the Portuguese laughingly to the Vicomtesse, when Eugene had taken leave of them. END
BEGIN NOW He will break the bank. END
BEGIN NOW He is as supple as an eel; he will go a long way, of that I am sure. END
BEGIN NOW Who else could have picked out a woman for him, as you did, just when she needed consolation? END
BEGIN NOW But it is not certain that she does not still love the faithless lover, said de Beauseant. END
BEGIN NOW The student meanwhile walked back from the Theatre-Italien to the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve, making the most delightful plans as he went. END
BEGIN NOW He had noticed how closely de Restaud had scrutinized him when he sat beside de Nucingen, and inferred that the Countess' doors would not be closed in the future. END
BEGIN NOW Four important houses were now open to him&mdash;for he meant to stand well with the Marechale; he had four supporters in the inmost circle of society in Paris. END
BEGIN NOW Even now it was clear to him that, once involved in this intricate social machinery, he must attach himself to a spoke of the wheel that was to turn and raise his fortunes; he would not examine himself too curiously as to the methods, but he was certain of the end, and conscious of the power to gain and keep his hold. END
BEGIN NOW If de Nucingen takes an interest in me, I will teach her how to manage her husband. END
BEGIN NOW That husband of hers is a great speculator; he might put me in the way of making a fortune by a single stroke. END
BEGIN NOW He did not say this bluntly in so many words; as yet, indeed, he was not sufficient of a diplomatist to sum up a situation, to see its possibilities at a glance, and calculate the chances in his favor. END
BEGIN NOW These were nothing but hazy ideas that floated over his mental horizon; they were less cynical than Vautrin's notions; but if they had been tried in the crucible of conscience, no very pure result would have issued from the test. END
BEGIN NOW It is by a succession of such like transactions that men sink at last to the level of the relaxed morality of this epoch, when there have never been so few of those who square their courses with their theories, so few of those noble characters who do not yield to temptation, for whom the slightest deviation from the line of rectitude is a crime. END
BEGIN NOW To these magnificent types of uncompromising Right we owe two masterpieces&mdash;the Alceste of Moliere, and, in our own day, the characters of Jeanie Deans and her father in Sir Walter Scott's novel. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps a work which should chronicle the opposite course, which should trace out all the devious courses through which a man of the world, a man of ambitions, drags his conscience, just steering clear of crime that he may gain his end and yet save appearances, such a chronicle would be no less edifying and no less dramatic. END
BEGIN NOW Rastignac went home. END
BEGIN NOW He was fascinated by de Nucingen; he seemed to see her before him, slender and graceful as a swallow. END
BEGIN NOW He recalled the intoxicating sweetness of her eyes, her fair hair, the delicate silken tissue of the skin, beneath which it almost seemed to him that he could see the blood coursing; the tones of her voice still exerted a spell over him; he had forgotten nothing; his walk perhaps heated his imagination by sending a glow of warmth through his veins. END
BEGIN NOW He knocked unceremoniously at Goriot's door. END
BEGIN NOW I have seen Delphine, neighbor, said he. END
BEGIN NOW Where? END
BEGIN NOW At the Italiens. END
BEGIN NOW Did she enjoy it?.... END
BEGIN NOW Just come inside, and the old man left his bed, unlocked the door, and promptly returned again. END
BEGIN NOW It was the first time that Eugene had been in Father Goriot's room, and he could not control his feeling of amazement at the contrast between the den in which the father lived and the costume of the daughter whom he had just beheld. END
BEGIN NOW The window was curtainless, the walls were damp, in places the varnished wall-paper had come away and gave glimpses of the grimy yellow plaster beneath. END
BEGIN NOW The wretched bed on which the old man lay boasted but one thin blanket, and a wadded quilt made out of large pieces of Vauquer's old dresses. END
BEGIN NOW The floor was damp and gritty. END
BEGIN NOW Opposite the window stood a chest of drawers made of rosewood, one of the old-fashioned kind with a curving front and brass handles, shaped like rings of twisted vine stems covered with flowers and leaves. END
BEGIN NOW On a venerable piece of furniture with a wooden shelf stood a ewer and basin and shaving apparatus. END
BEGIN NOW A pair of shoes stood in one corner; a night-table by the bed had neither a door nor marble slab. END
BEGIN NOW There was not a trace of a fire in the empty grate; the square walnut table with the crossbar against which Father Goriot had crushed and twisted his posset-dish stood near the hearth. END
BEGIN NOW The old man's hat was lying on a broken-down bureau. END
BEGIN NOW An armchair stuffed with straw and a couple of chairs completed the list of ramshackle furniture. END
BEGIN NOW From the tester of the bed, tied to the ceiling by a piece of rag, hung a strip of some cheap material in large red and black checks. END
BEGIN NOW No poor drudge in a garret could be worse lodged than Father Goriot in Vauquer's lodging-house. END
BEGIN NOW The mere sight of the room sent a chill through you and a sense of oppression; it was like the worst cell in a prison. END
BEGIN NOW Luckily, Goriot could not see the effect that his surroundings produced on Eugene as the latter deposited his candle on the night-table. END
BEGIN NOW The old man turned round, keeping the bedclothes huddled up to his chin. END
BEGIN NOW Well, he said, and which do you like the best, de Restaud or de Nucingen? END
BEGIN NOW I like Delphine the best, said the law student, because she loves you the best. END
BEGIN NOW At the words so heartily spoken the old man's hand slipped out from under the bedclothes and grasped Eugene's. END
BEGIN NOW Thank you, thank you, he said, gratefully. END
BEGIN NOW Then what did she say about me? END
BEGIN NOW The student repeated the Baroness' remarks with some embellishments of his own, the old man listening the while as though he heard a voice from Heaven. END
BEGIN NOW Dear child! END
BEGIN NOW he said. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, yes, she is very fond of me. END
BEGIN NOW But you must not believe all that she tells you about Anastasie. END
BEGIN NOW The two sisters are jealous of each other, you see, another proof of their affection. END
BEGIN NOW de Restaud is very fond of me too. END
BEGIN NOW I know she is. END
BEGIN NOW A father sees his children as God sees all of us; he looks into the very depths of their hearts; he knows their intentions; and both of them are so loving. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW if I only had good sons-in-law, I should be too happy, and I dare say there is no perfect happiness here below. END
BEGIN NOW If I might live with them&mdash;simply hear their voices, know that they are there, see them go and come as I used to do at home when they were still with me; why, my heart bounds at the thought.... END
BEGIN NOW Were they nicely dressed? END
BEGIN NOW Yes, said Eugene. END
BEGIN NOW But, M. Goriot, how is it that your daughters have such fine houses, while you live in such a den as this? END
BEGIN NOW Dear me, why should I want anything better? END
BEGIN NOW he replied, with seeming carelessness. END
BEGIN NOW I can't quite explain to you how it is; I am not used to stringing words together properly, but it all lies there&mdash;- he said, tapping his heart. END
BEGIN NOW My real life is in my two girls, you see; and so long as they are happy, and smartly dressed, and have soft carpets under their feet, what does it matter what clothes I wear or where I lie down of a night? END
BEGIN NOW I shall never feel cold so long as they are warm; I shall never feel dull if they are laughing. END
BEGIN NOW I have no troubles but theirs. END
BEGIN NOW When you, too, are a father, and you hear your children's little voices, you will say to yourself, 'That has all come from me.' END
BEGIN NOW You will feel that those little ones are akin to every drop in your veins, that they are the very flower of your life (and what else are they? END
BEGIN NOW ); you will cleave so closely to them that you seem to feel every movement that they make. END
BEGIN NOW Everywhere I hear their voices sounding in my ears. END
BEGIN NOW If they are sad, the look in their eyes freezes my blood. END
BEGIN NOW Some day you will find out that there is far more happiness in another's happiness than in your own. END
BEGIN NOW It is something that I cannot explain, something within that sends a glow of warmth all through you. END
BEGIN NOW In short, I live my life three times over. END
BEGIN NOW Shall I tell you something funny? END
BEGIN NOW Well, then, since I have been a father, I have come to understand God. END
BEGIN NOW He is everywhere in the world, because the whole world comes from Him. END
BEGIN NOW And it is just the same with my children, monsieur. END
BEGIN NOW Only, I love my daughters better than God loves the world, for the world is not so beautiful as God Himself is, but my children are more beautiful than I am. END
BEGIN NOW Their lives are so bound up with mine that I felt somehow that you would see them this evening. END
BEGIN NOW Great Heaven! END
BEGIN NOW If any man would make my little Delphine as happy as a wife is when she is loved, I would black his boots and run on his errands. END
BEGIN NOW That miserable M. de Marsay is a cur; I know all about him from her maid. END
BEGIN NOW A longing to wring his neck comes over me now and then. END
BEGIN NOW He does not love her! END
BEGIN NOW does not love a pearl of a woman, with a voice like a nightingale and shaped like a model. END
BEGIN NOW Where can her eyes have been when she married that great lump of an Alsatian? END
BEGIN NOW They ought both of them to have married young men, good-looking and good-tempered&mdash;but, after all, they had their own way. END
BEGIN NOW Father Goriot was sublime. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene had never yet seen his face light up as it did now with the passionate fervor of a father's love. END
BEGIN NOW It is worthy of remark that strong feeling has a very subtle and pervasive power; the roughest nature, in the endeavor to express a deep and sincere affection, communicates to others the influence that has put resonance into the voice, and eloquence into every gesture, wrought a change in the very features of the speaker; for under the inspiration of passion the stupidest human being attains to the highest eloquence of ideas, if not of language, and seems to move in some sphere of light. END
BEGIN NOW In the old man's tones and gesture there was something just then of the same spell that a great actor exerts over his audience. END
BEGIN NOW But does not the poet in us find expression in our affections? END
BEGIN NOW Well, said Eugene, perhaps you will not be sorry to hear that she is pretty sure to break with de Marsay before long. END
BEGIN NOW That sprig of fashion has left her for the Princesse Galathionne. END
BEGIN NOW For my part, I fell in love with Delphine this evening. END
BEGIN NOW Stuff! END
BEGIN NOW said Father Goriot. END
BEGIN NOW I did indeed, and she did not regard me with aversion. END
BEGIN NOW For a whole hour we talked of love, and I am to go to call on her on Saturday, the day after to-morrow. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW how I should love you, if she should like you. END
BEGIN NOW You are kind-hearted; you would never make her miserable. END
BEGIN NOW If you were to forsake her, I would cut your throat at once. END
BEGIN NOW A woman does not love twice, you see! END
BEGIN NOW Good heavens! END
BEGIN NOW what nonsense I am talking, M. Eugene! END
BEGIN NOW It is cold; you ought not to stay here. END
BEGIN NOW _Mon Dieu!_ so you have heard her speak? END
BEGIN NOW What message did she give you for me? END
BEGIN NOW None at all, said Eugene to himself; aloud he answered, She told me to tell you that your daughter sends you a good kiss. END
BEGIN NOW Good-night, neighbor! END
BEGIN NOW Sleep well, and pleasant dreams to you! END
BEGIN NOW I have mine already made for me by that message from her. END
BEGIN NOW May God grant you all your desires! END
BEGIN NOW You have come in like a good angel on me to-night, and brought with you the air that my daughter breathes. END
BEGIN NOW Poor old fellow! END
BEGIN NOW said Eugene as he lay down. END
BEGIN NOW It is enough to melt a heart of stone. END
BEGIN NOW His daughter no more thought of him than of the Grand Turk. END
BEGIN NOW Ever after this conference Goriot looked upon his neighbor as a friend, a confidant such as he had never hoped to find; and there was established between the two the only relationship that could attach this old man to another man. END
BEGIN NOW The passions never miscalculate. END
BEGIN NOW Father Goriot felt that this friendship brought him closer to his daughter Delphine; he thought that he should find a warmer welcome for himself if the Baroness should care for Eugene. END
BEGIN NOW Moreover, he had confided one of his troubles to the younger man. END
BEGIN NOW de Nucingen, for whose happiness he prayed a thousand times daily, had never known the joys of love. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene was certainly (to make use of his own expression) one of the nicest young men that he had ever seen, and some prophetic instinct seemed to tell him that Eugene was to give her the happiness which had not been hers. END
BEGIN NOW These were the beginnings of a friendship that grew up between the old man and his neighbor; but for this friendship the catastrophe of the drama must have remained a mystery. END
BEGIN NOW The affection with which Father Goriot regarded Eugene, by whom he seated himself at breakfast, the change in Goriot's face, which as a rule, looked as expressionless as a plaster cast, and a few words that passed between the two, surprised the other lodgers. END
BEGIN NOW Vautrin, who saw Eugene for the first time since their interview, seemed as if he would fain read the student's very soul. END
BEGIN NOW During the night Eugene had had some time in which to scan the vast field which lay before him; and now, as he remembered yesterday's proposal, the thought of Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Taillefer's dowry came, of course, to his mind, and he could not help thinking of Victorine as the most exemplary youth may think of an heiress. END
BEGIN NOW It chanced that their eyes met. END
BEGIN NOW The poor girl did not fail to see that Eugene looked very handsome in his new clothes. END
BEGIN NOW So much was said in the glance, thus exchanged, that Eugene could not doubt but that he was associated in her mind with the vague hopes that lie dormant in a girl's heart and gather round the first attractive newcomer. END
BEGIN NOW Eight hundred thousand francs! END
BEGIN NOW a voice cried in his ears, but suddenly he took refuge in the memories of yesterday evening, thinking that his extemporized passion for de Nucingen was a talisman that would preserve him from this temptation. END
BEGIN NOW They gave Rossini's _Barber of Seville_ at the Italiens yesterday evening, he remarked. END
BEGIN NOW I never heard such delicious music. END
BEGIN NOW Good gracious! END
BEGIN NOW how lucky people are to have a box at the Italiens! END
BEGIN NOW Father Goriot drank in every word that Eugene let fall, and watched him as a dog watches his master's slightest movement. END
BEGIN NOW You men are like fighting cocks, said Vauquer; you do what you like. END
BEGIN NOW How did you get back? END
BEGIN NOW inquired Vautrin. END
BEGIN NOW I walked, answered Eugene. END
BEGIN NOW For my own part, remarked the tempter, I do not care about doing things by halves. END
BEGIN NOW If I want to enjoy myself that way, I should prefer to go in my carriage, sit in my own box, and do the thing comfortably. END
BEGIN NOW Everything or nothing; that is my motto. END
BEGIN NOW And a good one, too, commented Vauquer. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps you will see de Nucingen to-day, said Eugene, addressing Goriot in an undertone. END
BEGIN NOW She will welcome you with open arms, I am sure; she would want to ask you for all sorts of little details about me. END
BEGIN NOW I have found out that she will do anything in the world to be known by my cousin de Beauseant; don't forget to tell her that I love her too well not to think of trying to arrange this. END
BEGIN NOW Rastignac went at once to the Ecole de Droit. END
BEGIN NOW He had no mind to stay a moment longer than was necessary in that odious house. END
BEGIN NOW He wasted his time that day; he had fallen a victim to that fever of the brain that accompanies the too vivid hopes of youth. END
BEGIN NOW Vautrin's arguments had set him meditating on social life, and he was deep in these reflections when he happened on his friend Bianchon in the Jardin du Luxembourg. END
BEGIN NOW What makes you look so solemn? END
BEGIN NOW said the medical student, putting an arm through Eugene's as they went towards the Palais. END
BEGIN NOW I am tormented by temptations. END
BEGIN NOW What kind? END
BEGIN NOW There is a cure for temptation. END
BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW Yielding to it. END
BEGIN NOW You laugh, but you don't know what it is all about. END
BEGIN NOW Have you read Rousseau? END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Do you remember that he asks the reader somewhere what he would do if he could make a fortune by killing an old mandarin somewhere in China by mere force of wishing it, and without stirring from Paris? END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Well, then? END
BEGIN NOW Pshaw! END
BEGIN NOW I am at my thirty-third mandarin. END
BEGIN NOW Seriously, though. END
BEGIN NOW Look here, suppose you were sure that you could do it, and had only to give a nod. END
BEGIN NOW Would you do it? END
BEGIN NOW Is he well stricken in years, this mandarin of yours? END
BEGIN NOW Pshaw! END
BEGIN NOW after all, young or old, paralytic, or well and sound, my word for it.\... Well, then. END
BEGIN NOW Hang it, no! END
BEGIN NOW You are a good fellow, Bianchon. END
BEGIN NOW But suppose you loved a woman well enough to lose your soul in hell for her, and that she wanted money for dresses and a carriage, and all her whims, in fact? END
BEGIN NOW Why, here you are taking away my reason, and want me to reason! END
BEGIN NOW Well, then, Bianchon, I am mad; bring me to my senses. END
BEGIN NOW I have two sisters as beautiful and innocent as angels, and I want them to be happy. END
BEGIN NOW How am I to find two hundred thousand francs apiece for them in the next five years? END
BEGIN NOW Now and then in life, you see, you must play for heavy stakes, and it is no use wasting your luck on low play. END
BEGIN NOW But you are only stating the problem that lies before every one at the outset of his life, and you want to cut the Gordian knot with a sword. END
BEGIN NOW If that is the way of it, dear boy, you must be an Alexander, or to the hulks you go. END
BEGIN NOW For my own part, I am quite contented with the little lot I mean to make for myself somewhere in the country, when I mean to step into my father's shoes and plod along. END
BEGIN NOW A man's affections are just as fully satisfied by the smallest circle as they can be by a vast circumference. END
BEGIN NOW Napoleon himself could only dine once, and he could not have more mistresses than a house student at the Capuchins. END
BEGIN NOW Happiness, old man, depends on what lies between the sole of your foot and the crown of your head; and whether it costs a million or a hundred louis, the actual amount of pleasure that you receive rests entirely with you, and is just exactly the same in any case. END
BEGIN NOW I am for letting that Chinaman live. END
BEGIN NOW Thank you, Bianchon; you have done me good. END
BEGIN NOW We will always be friends. END
BEGIN NOW I say, remarked the medical student, as they came to the end of a broad walk in the Jardin des Plantes, I saw the Michonneau and Poiret a few minutes ago on a bench chatting with a gentleman whom I used to see in last year's troubles hanging about the Chamber of Deputies; he seems to me, in fact, to be a detective dressed up like a decent retired tradesman. END
BEGIN NOW Let us keep an eye on that couple; I will tell you why some time. END
BEGIN NOW Good-bye; it is nearly four o'clock, and I must be in to answer to my name. END
BEGIN NOW When Eugene reached the lodging-house, he found Father Goriot waiting for him. END
BEGIN NOW Here, cried the old man, here is a letter from her. END
BEGIN NOW Pretty handwriting, eh? END
BEGIN NOW Eugene broke the seal and read:&mdash; Sir,&mdash;I have heard from my father that you are fond of Italian music. END
BEGIN NOW I shall be delighted if you will do me the pleasure of accepting a seat in my box. END
BEGIN NOW La Fodor and Pellegrini will sing on Saturday, so I am sure that you will not refuse me. END
BEGIN NOW M. de Nucingen and I shall be pleased if you will dine with us; we shall be quite by ourselves. END
BEGIN NOW If you will come and be my escort, my husband will be glad to be relieved from his conjugal duties. END
BEGIN NOW Do not answer, but simply come.&mdash;Yours sincerely, D. DE N. Let me see it, said Father Goriot, when Eugene had read the letter. END
BEGIN NOW You are going, aren't you? END
BEGIN NOW he added, when he had smelled the writing-paper. END
BEGIN NOW How nice it smells! END
BEGIN NOW Her fingers have touched it, that is certain. END
BEGIN NOW A woman does not fling herself at a man's head in this way, the student was thinking. END
BEGIN NOW She wants to use me to bring back de Marsay; nothing but pique makes a woman do a thing like this. END
BEGIN NOW Well, said Father Goriot, what are you thinking about? END
BEGIN NOW Eugene did not know the fever or vanity that possessed some women in those days; how should he imagine that to open a door in the Faubourg Saint-Germain a banker's wife would go to almost any length. END
BEGIN NOW For the coterie of the Faubourg Saint-Germain was a charmed circle, and the women who moved in it were at that time the queens of society; and among the greatest of these _Dames du Petit-Chateau_, as they were called, were de Beauseant and her friends the Duchesse de Langeais and the Duchesse de Maufrigneause. END
BEGIN NOW Rastignac was alone in his ignorance of the frantic efforts made by women who lived in the Chausee-d'Antin to enter this seventh heaven and shine among the brightest constellations of their sex. END
BEGIN NOW But his cautious disposition stood him in good stead, and kept his judgment cool, and the not altogether enviable power of imposing instead of accepting conditions. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, I am going, he replied. END
BEGIN NOW So it was curiosity that drew him to de Nucingen; while, if she had treated him disdainfully, passion perhaps might have brought him to her feet. END
BEGIN NOW Still he waited almost impatiently for to-morrow, and the hour when he could go to her. END
BEGIN NOW There is almost as much charm for a young man in a first flirtation as there is in first love. END
BEGIN NOW The certainty of success is a source of happiness to which men do not confess, and all the charm of certain women lies in this. END
BEGIN NOW The desire of conquest springs no less from the easiness than from the difficulty of triumph, and every passion is excited or sustained by one or the other of these two motives which divide the empire of love. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps this division is one result of the great question of temperaments; which, after all, dominates social life. END
BEGIN NOW The melancholic temperament may stand in need of the tonic of coquetry, while those of nervous or sanguine complexion withdraw if they meet with a too stubborn resistance. END
BEGIN NOW In other words, the lymphatic temperament is essentially despondent, and the rhapsodic is bilious. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene lingered over his toilette with an enjoyment of all its little details that is grateful to a young man's self-love, though he will not own to it for fear of being laughed at. END
BEGIN NOW He thought, as he arranged his hair, that a pretty woman's glances would wander through the dark curls. END
BEGIN NOW He indulged in childish tricks like any young girl dressing for a dance, and gazed complacently at his graceful figure while he smoothed out the creases of his coat. END
BEGIN NOW There are worse figures, that is certain, he said to himself. END
BEGIN NOW Then he went downstairs, just as the rest of the household were sitting down to dinner, and took with good humor the boisterous applause excited by his elegant appearance. END
BEGIN NOW The amazement with which any attention to dress is regarded in a lodging-house is a very characteristic trait. END
BEGIN NOW No one can put on a new coat but every one else must say his say about it. END
BEGIN NOW Clk! END
BEGIN NOW clk! END
BEGIN NOW clk! END
BEGIN NOW cried Bianchon, making the sound with his tongue against the roof of his mouth, like a driver urging on a horse. END
BEGIN NOW He holds himself like a duke and a peer of France, said Vauquer. END
BEGIN NOW Are you going a-courting? END
BEGIN NOW inquired Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau. END
BEGIN NOW Cock-a-doodle-doo! END
BEGIN NOW cried the artist. END
BEGIN NOW My compliments to my lady your wife, from the _employe_ at the Museum. END
BEGIN NOW Your wife; have you a wife? END
BEGIN NOW asked Poiret. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, in compartments, water-tight and floats, guaranteed fast color, all prices from twenty-five to forty sous, neat check patterns in the latest fashion and best taste, will wash, half-linen, half-cotton, half-wool; a certain cure for toothache and other complaints under the patronage of the Royal College of Physicians! END
BEGIN NOW children like it! END
BEGIN NOW a remedy for headache, indigestion, and all other diseases affecting the throat, eyes, and ears! END
BEGIN NOW cried Vautrin, with a comical imitation of the volubility of a quack at a fair. END
BEGIN NOW And how much shall we say for this marvel, gentlemen? END
BEGIN NOW Twopence? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing of the sort. END
BEGIN NOW All that is left in stock after supplying the Great Mogul. END
BEGIN NOW All the crowned heads of Europe, including the Gr-r-rand Duke of Baden, have been anxious to get a sight of it. END
BEGIN NOW Walk up! END
BEGIN NOW walk up! END
BEGIN NOW gentlemen! END
BEGIN NOW Pay at the desk as you go in! END
BEGIN NOW Strike up the music there! END
BEGIN NOW Brooum, la, la, trinn! END
BEGIN NOW la, la, boum! END
BEGIN NOW boum! END
BEGIN NOW Mister Clarinette, there you are out of tune! END
BEGIN NOW he added gruffly; I will rap your knuckles for you! END
BEGIN NOW Goodness! END
BEGIN NOW what an amusing man! END
BEGIN NOW said Vauquer to Couture; I should never feel dull with him in the house. END
BEGIN NOW This burlesque of Vautrin's was the signal for an outburst of merriment, and under cover of jokes and laughter Eugene caught a glance from Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Taillefer; she had leaned over to say a few words in Couture's ear. END
BEGIN NOW The cab is at the door, announced Sylvie. END
BEGIN NOW But where is he going to dine? END
BEGIN NOW asked Bianchon. END
BEGIN NOW With Madame la Baronne de Nucingen. END
BEGIN NOW M. Goriot's daughter, said the law student. END
BEGIN NOW At this, all eyes turned to the old vermicelli maker; he was gazing at Eugene with something like envy in his eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Rastignac reached the house in the Rue Saint-Lazare, one of those many-windowed houses with a mean-looking portico and slender columns, which are considered the thing in Paris, a typical banker's house, decorated in the most ostentatious fashion; the walls lined with stucco, the landings of marble mosaic. END
BEGIN NOW de Nucingen was sitting in a little drawing-room; the room was painted in the Italian fashion, and decorated like a restaurant. END
BEGIN NOW The Baroness seemed depressed. END
BEGIN NOW The effort that she made to hide her feelings aroused Eugene's interest; it was plain that she was not playing a part. END
BEGIN NOW He had expected a little flutter of excitement at his coming, and he found her dispirited and sad. END
BEGIN NOW The disappointment piqued his vanity. END
BEGIN NOW My claim to your confidence is very small, madame, he said, after rallying her on her abstracted mood; but if I am in the way, please tell me so frankly; I count on your good faith. END
BEGIN NOW No, stay with me, she said; I shall be all alone if you go. END
BEGIN NOW Nucingen is dining in town, and I do not want to be alone; I want to be taken out of myself. END
BEGIN NOW But what is the matter? END
BEGIN NOW You are the very last person whom I should tell, she exclaimed. END
BEGIN NOW Then I am connected in some way in this secret. END
BEGIN NOW I wonder what it is? END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps. END
BEGIN NOW Yet, no, she went on; it is a domestic quarrel, which ought to be buried in the depths of the heart. END
BEGIN NOW I am very unhappy; did I not tell you so the day before yesterday? END
BEGIN NOW Golden chains are the heaviest of all fetters. END
BEGIN NOW When a woman tells a young man that she is very unhappy, and when the young man is clever, and well dressed, and has fifteen hundred francs lying idle in his pocket, he is sure to think as Eugene said, and he becomes a coxcomb. END
BEGIN NOW What can you have left to wish for? END
BEGIN NOW he answered. END
BEGIN NOW You are young, beautiful, beloved, and rich. END
BEGIN NOW Do not let us talk of my affairs, she said shaking her head mournfully. END
BEGIN NOW We will dine together _tete-a-tete_, and afterwards we will go to hear the most exquisite music. END
BEGIN NOW Am I to your taste? END
BEGIN NOW she went on, rising and displaying her gown of white cashmere, covered with Persian designs in the most superb taste. END
BEGIN NOW I wish that you were altogether mine, said Eugene; you are charming. END
BEGIN NOW You would have a forlorn piece of property, she said, smiling bitterly. END
BEGIN NOW There is nothing about me that betrays my wretchedness; and yet, in spite of appearances, I am in despair. END
BEGIN NOW I cannot sleep; my troubles have broken my night's rest; I shall grow ugly. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW that is impossible, cried the law student; but I am curious to know what these troubles can be that a devoted love cannot efface. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW if I were to tell you about them, you would shun me, she said. END
BEGIN NOW Your love for me is as yet only the conventional gallantry that men use to masquerade in; and, if you really loved me, you would be driven to despair. END
BEGIN NOW I must keep silence, you see. END
BEGIN NOW Let us talk of something else, for pity's sake, she added. END
BEGIN NOW Let me show you my rooms. END
BEGIN NOW No; let us stay here, answered Eugene; he sat down on the sofa before the fire, and boldly took de Nucingen's hand in his. END
BEGIN NOW She surrendered it to him; he even felt the pressure of her fingers in one of the spasmodic clutches that betray terrible agitation. END
BEGIN NOW Listen, said Rastignac; if you are in trouble, you ought to tell me about it. END
BEGIN NOW I want to prove to you that I love you for yourself alone. END
BEGIN NOW You must speak to me frankly about your troubles, so that I can put an end to them, even if I have to kill half-a-dozen men; or I shall go, never to return. END
BEGIN NOW Very well, she cried, putting her hand to her forehead in an agony of despair, I will put you to the proof, and this very moment. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, she said to herself, I have no other resource left. END
BEGIN NOW She rang the bell. END
BEGIN NOW Are the horses put in for the master? END
BEGIN NOW she asked of the servant. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, madame. END
BEGIN NOW I shall take his carriage myself. END
BEGIN NOW He can have mine and my horses. END
BEGIN NOW Serve dinner at seven o'clock. END
BEGIN NOW Now, come with me, she said to Eugene, who thought as he sat in the banker's carriage beside de Nucingen that he must surely be dreaming. END
BEGIN NOW To the Palais-Royal, she said to the coachman; stop near the Theatre-Francais. END
BEGIN NOW She seemed to be too troubled and excited to answer the innumerable questions that Eugene put to her. END
BEGIN NOW He was at a loss what to think of her mute resistance, her obstinate silence. END
BEGIN NOW Another moment and she will escape me, he said to himself. END
BEGIN NOW When the carriage stopped at last, the Baroness gave the law student a glance that silenced his wild words, for he was almost beside himself. END
BEGIN NOW Is it true that you love me? END
BEGIN NOW she asked. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, he answered, and in his manner and tone there was no trace of the uneasiness that he felt. END
BEGIN NOW You will not think ill of me, will you, whatever I may ask of you? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW Are you ready to do my bidding? END
BEGIN NOW Blindly. END
BEGIN NOW Have you ever been to a gaming-house? END
BEGIN NOW she asked in a tremulous voice. END
BEGIN NOW Never. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW now I can breathe. END
BEGIN NOW You will have luck. END
BEGIN NOW Here is my purse, she said. END
BEGIN NOW Take it! END
BEGIN NOW there are a hundred francs in it, all that such a fortunate woman as I can call her own. END
BEGIN NOW Go up into one of the gaming-houses&mdash;I do not know where they are, but there are some near the Palais-Royal. END
BEGIN NOW Try your luck with the hundred francs at a game they call roulette; lose it all or bring me back six thousand francs. END
BEGIN NOW I will tell you about my troubles when you come back. END
BEGIN NOW Devil take me, I'm sure, if I have a glimmer of a notion of what I am about, but I will obey you, he added, with inward exultation, as he thought, She has gone too far to draw back&mdash;she can refuse me nothing now! END
BEGIN NOW Eugene took the dainty little purse, inquired the way of a second-hand clothes-dealer, and hurried to number , which happened to be the nearest gaming-house. END
BEGIN NOW He mounted the staircase, surrendered his hat, and asked the way to the roulette-table, whither the attendant took him, not a little to the astonishment of the regular comers. END
BEGIN NOW All eyes were fixed on Eugene as he asked, without bashfulness, where he was to deposit his stakes. END
BEGIN NOW If you put a louis on one only of those thirty-six numbers, and it turns up, you will win thirty-six louis, said a respectable-looking, white-haired old man in answer to his inquiry. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene staked the whole of his money on the number (his own age). END
BEGIN NOW There was a cry of surprise; before he knew what he had done, he had won. END
BEGIN NOW Take your money off, sir, said the old gentleman; you don't often win twice running by that system. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene took the rake that the old man handed to him, and drew in his three thousand six hundred francs, and, still perfectly ignorant of what he was about, staked again on the red. END
BEGIN NOW The bystanders watched him enviously as they saw him continue to play. END
BEGIN NOW The disc turned, and again he won; the banker threw him three thousand six hundred francs once more. END
BEGIN NOW You have seven thousand, two hundred francs of your own, the old gentleman said in his ear. END
BEGIN NOW Take my advice and go away with your winnings; red has turned up eight times already. END
BEGIN NOW If you are charitable, you will show your gratitude for sound counsel by giving a trifle to an old prefect of Napoleon who is down on his luck. END
BEGIN NOW Rastignac's head was swimming; he saw ten of his louis pass into the white-haired man's possession, and went down-stairs with his seven thousand francs; he was still ignorant of the game, and stupefied by his luck. END
BEGIN NOW So, that is over; and now where will you take me? END
BEGIN NOW he asked, as soon as the door was closed, and he showed the seven thousand francs to de Nucingen. END
BEGIN NOW Delphine flung her arms about him, but there was no passion in that wild embrace. END
BEGIN NOW You have saved me! END
BEGIN NOW she cried, and tears of joy flowed fast. END
BEGIN NOW I will tell you everything, my friend. END
BEGIN NOW For you will be my friend, will you not? END
BEGIN NOW I am rich, you think, very rich; I have everything I want, or I seem as if I had everything. END
BEGIN NOW Very well, you must know that M. de Nucingen does not allow me the control of a single penny; he pays all the bills for the house expenses; he pays for my carriages and opera box; he does not give me enough to pay for my dress, and he reduces me to poverty in secret on purpose. END
BEGIN NOW I am too proud to beg from him. END
BEGIN NOW I should be the vilest of women if I could take his money at the price at which he offers it. END
BEGIN NOW Do you ask how I, with seven hundred thousand francs of my own, could let myself be robbed? END
BEGIN NOW It is because I was proud, and scorned to speak. END
BEGIN NOW We are so young, so artless when our married life begins! END
BEGIN NOW I never could bring myself to ask my husband for money; the words would have made my lips bleed, I did not dare to ask; I spent my savings first, and then the money that my poor father gave me, then I ran into debt. END
BEGIN NOW Marriage for me is a hideous farce; I cannot talk about it, let it suffice to say that Nucingen and I have separate rooms, and that I would fling myself out of the window sooner than consent to any other manner of life. END
BEGIN NOW I suffered agonies when I had to confess to my girlish extravagance, my debts for jewelry and trifles (for our poor father had never refused us anything, and spoiled us), but at last I found courage to tell him about them. END
BEGIN NOW After all, I had a fortune of my own. END
BEGIN NOW Nucingen flew into a rage; he said that I should be the ruin of him, and used frightful language! END
BEGIN NOW I wished myself a hundred feet down in the earth. END
BEGIN NOW He had my dowry, so he paid my debts, but he stipulated at the same time that my expenses in future must not exceed a certain fixed sum, and I gave way for the sake of peace. END
BEGIN NOW And then, she went on, I wanted to gratify the self-love of some one whom you know. END
BEGIN NOW He may have deceived me, but I should do him the justice to say that there was nothing petty in his character. END
BEGIN NOW But, after all, he threw me over disgracefully. END
BEGIN NOW If, at a woman's utmost need, _somebody_ heaps gold upon her, he ought never to forsake her; that love should last for ever! END
BEGIN NOW But you, at one-and-twenty, you, the soul of honor, with the unsullied conscience of youth, will ask me how a woman can bring herself to accept money in such a way? END
BEGIN NOW _Mon Dieu_! END
BEGIN NOW is it not natural to share everything with the one to whom we owe our happiness? END
BEGIN NOW When all has been given, why should we pause and hesitate over a part? END
BEGIN NOW Money is as nothing between us until the moment when the sentiment that bound us together ceases to exist. END
BEGIN NOW Were we not bound to each other for life? END
BEGIN NOW Who that believes in love foresees such an end to love? END
BEGIN NOW You swear to love us eternally; how, then, can our interests be separate? END
BEGIN NOW You do not know how I suffered to-day when Nucingen refused to give me six thousand francs; he spends as much as that every month on his mistress, an opera dancer! END
BEGIN NOW I thought of killing myself. END
BEGIN NOW The wildest thoughts came into my head. END
BEGIN NOW There have been moments in my life when I have envied my servants, and would have changed places with my maid. END
BEGIN NOW It was madness to think of going to our father, Anastasie and I have bled him dry; our poor father would have sold himself if he could have raised six thousand francs that way. END
BEGIN NOW I should have driven him frantic to no purpose. END
BEGIN NOW You have saved me from shame and death; I was beside myself with anguish. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW monsieur, I owed you this explanation after my mad ravings. END
BEGIN NOW When you left me just now, as soon as you were out of sight, I longed to escape, to run away... where, I did not know. END
BEGIN NOW Half the women in Paris lead such lives as mine; they live in apparent luxury, and in their souls are tormented by anxiety. END
BEGIN NOW I know of poor creatures even more miserable than I; there are women who are driven to ask their tradespeople to make out false bills, women who rob their husbands. END
BEGIN NOW Some men believe that an Indian shawl worth a thousand louis only cost five hundred francs, others that a shawl costing five hundred francs is worth a hundred louis. END
BEGIN NOW There are women, too, with narrow incomes, who scrape and save and starve their children to pay for a dress. END
BEGIN NOW I am innocent of these base meannesses. END
BEGIN NOW But this is the last extremity of my torture. END
BEGIN NOW Some women will sell themselves to their husbands, and so obtain their way, but I, at any rate, am free. END
BEGIN NOW If I chose, Nucingen would cover me with gold, but I would rather weep on the breast of a man whom I can respect. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW tonight, M. de Marsay will no longer have a right to think of me as a woman whom he has paid. END
BEGIN NOW She tried to conceal her tears from him, hiding her face in her hands; Eugene drew them away and looked at her; she seemed to him sublime at that moment. END
BEGIN NOW It is hideous, is it not, she cried, to speak in a breath of money and affection. END
BEGIN NOW You cannot love me after this, she added. END
BEGIN NOW The incongruity between the ideas of honor which make women so great, and the errors in conduct which are forced upon them by the constitution of society, had thrown Eugene's thoughts into confusion; he uttered soothing and consoling words, and wondered at the beautiful woman before him, and at the artless imprudence of her cry of pain. END
BEGIN NOW You will not remember this against me? END
BEGIN NOW she asked; promise me that you will not. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW madame, I am incapable of doing so, he said. END
BEGIN NOW She took his hand and held it to her heart, a movement full of grace that expressed her deep gratitude. END
BEGIN NOW I am free and happy once more, thanks to you, she said. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW I have felt lately as if I were in the grasp of an iron hand. END
BEGIN NOW But after this I mean to live simply and to spend nothing. END
BEGIN NOW You will think me just as pretty, will you not, my friend? END
BEGIN NOW Keep this, she went on, as she took only six of the banknotes. END
BEGIN NOW In conscience I owe you a thousand crowns, for I really ought to go halves with you. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene's maiden conscience resisted; but when the Baroness said, I am bound to look on you as an accomplice or as an enemy, he took the money. END
BEGIN NOW It shall be a last stake in reserve, he said, in case of misfortune. END
BEGIN NOW That was what I was dreading to hear, she cried, turning pale. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, if you would that I should be anything to you, swear to me that you will never re-enter a gaming-house. END
BEGIN NOW Great Heaven! END
BEGIN NOW that I should corrupt you! END
BEGIN NOW I should die of sorrow! END
BEGIN NOW They had reached the Rue Saint-Lazare by this time. END
BEGIN NOW The contrast between the ostentation of wealth in the house, and the wretched condition of its mistress, dazed the student; and Vautrin's cynical words began to ring in his ears. END
BEGIN NOW Seat yourself there, said the Baroness, pointing to a low chair beside the fire. END
BEGIN NOW I have a difficult letter to write, she added. END
BEGIN NOW Tell me what to say. END
BEGIN NOW Say nothing, Eugene answered her. END
BEGIN NOW Put the bills in an envelope, direct it, and send it by your maid. END
BEGIN NOW Why, you are a love of a man, she said. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW see what it is to have been well brought up. END
BEGIN NOW That is the Beauseant through and through, she went on, smiling at him. END
BEGIN NOW She is charming, thought Eugene, more and more in love. END
BEGIN NOW He looked round him at the room; there was an ostentatious character about the luxury, a meretricious taste in the splendor. END
BEGIN NOW Do you like it? END
BEGIN NOW she asked, as she rang for the maid. END
BEGIN NOW Therese, take this to M. de Marsay, and give it into his hands yourself. END
BEGIN NOW If he is not at home, bring the letter back to me. END
BEGIN NOW Therese went, but not before she had given Eugene a spiteful glance. END
BEGIN NOW Dinner was announced. END
BEGIN NOW Rastignac gave his arm to de Nucingen, she led the way into a pretty dining-room, and again he saw the luxury of the table which he had admired in his cousin's house. END
BEGIN NOW Come and dine with me on opera evenings, and we will go to the Italiens afterwards, she said. END
BEGIN NOW I should soon grow used to the pleasant life if it could last, but I am a poor student, and I have my way to make. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW you will succeed, she said laughing. END
BEGIN NOW You will see. END
BEGIN NOW All that you wish will come to pass. END
BEGIN NOW _I_ did not expect to be so happy. END
BEGIN NOW It is the wont of women to prove the impossible by the possible, and to annihilate facts by presentiments. END
BEGIN NOW When de Nucingen and Rastignac took their places in her box at the Bouffons, her face wore a look of happiness that made her so lovely that every one indulged in those small slanders against which women are defenceless; for the scandal that is uttered lightly is often seriously believed. END
BEGIN NOW Those who know Paris, believe nothing that is said, and say nothing of what is done there. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene took the Baroness' hand in his, and by some light pressure of the fingers, or a closer grasp of the hand, they found a language in which to express the sensations which the music gave them. END
BEGIN NOW It was an evening of intoxicating delight for both; and when it ended, and they went out together, de Nucingen insisted on taking Eugene with her as far as the Pont Neuf, he disputing with her the whole of the way for a single kiss after all those that she had showered upon him so passionately at the Palais-Royal; Eugene reproached her with inconsistency. END
BEGIN NOW That was gratitude, she said, for devotion that I did not dare to hope for, but now it would be a promise. END
BEGIN NOW And will you give me no promise, ingrate? END
BEGIN NOW He grew vexed. END
BEGIN NOW Then, with one of those impatient gestures that fill a lover with ecstasy, she gave him her hand to kiss, and he took it with a discontented air that delighted her. END
BEGIN NOW I shall see you at the ball on Monday, she said. END
BEGIN NOW As Eugene went home in the moonlight, he fell to serious reflections. END
BEGIN NOW He was satisfied, and yet dissatisfied. END
BEGIN NOW He was pleased with an adventure which would probably give him his desire, for in the end one of the prettiest and best-dressed women in Paris would be his; but, as a set-off, he saw his hopes of fortune brought to nothing; and as soon as he realized this fact, the vague thoughts of yesterday evening began to take a more decided shape in his mind. END
BEGIN NOW A check is sure to reveal to us the strength of our hopes. END
BEGIN NOW The more Eugene learned of the pleasures of life in Paris, the more impatient he felt of poverty and obscurity. END
BEGIN NOW He crumpled the banknote in his pocket, and found any quantity of plausible excuses for appropriating it. END
BEGIN NOW He reached the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve at last, and from the stairhead he saw a light in Goriot's room; the old man had lighted a candle, and set the door ajar, lest the student should pass him by, and go to his room without telling him all about his daughter, to use his own expression. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene, accordingly, told him everything without reserve. END
BEGIN NOW Then they think that I am ruined! END
BEGIN NOW cried Father Goriot, in an agony of jealousy and desperation. END
BEGIN NOW Why, I have still thirteen hundred livres a year! END
BEGIN NOW _Mon Dieu!_ Poor little girl! END
BEGIN NOW why did she not come to me? END
BEGIN NOW I would have sold my rentes; she should have had some of the principal, and I would have bought a life-annuity with the rest. END
BEGIN NOW My good neighbor, why did not _you_ come to tell me of her difficulty? END
BEGIN NOW How had you the heart to go and risk her poor little hundred francs at play? END
BEGIN NOW This is heart-breaking work. END
BEGIN NOW You see what it is to have sons-in-law. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW if I had hold of them, I would wring their necks. END
BEGIN NOW _Mon Dieu! END
BEGIN NOW crying!_ Did you say she was crying? END
BEGIN NOW With her head on my waistcoat, said Eugene. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW give it to me, said Father Goriot. END
BEGIN NOW What! END
BEGIN NOW my daughter's tears have fallen there&mdash;my darling Delphine, who never used to cry when she was a little girl! END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW I will buy you another; do not wear it again; let me have it. END
BEGIN NOW By the terms of her marriage-contract, she ought to have the use of her property. END
BEGIN NOW To-morrow morning I will go and see Derville; he is an attorney. END
BEGIN NOW I will demand that her money should be invested in her own name. END
BEGIN NOW I know the law. END
BEGIN NOW I am an old wolf, I will show my teeth. END
BEGIN NOW Here, father; this is a banknote for a thousand francs that she wanted me to keep out of our winnings. END
BEGIN NOW Keep them for her, in the pocket of the waistcoat. END
BEGIN NOW Goriot looked hard at Eugene, reached out and took the law student's hand, and Eugene felt a tear fall on it. END
BEGIN NOW You will succeed, the old man said. END
BEGIN NOW God is just, you see. END
BEGIN NOW I know an honest man when I see him, and I can tell you, there are not many men like you. END
BEGIN NOW I am to have another dear child in you, am I? END
BEGIN NOW There, go to sleep; you can sleep; you are not yet a father. END
BEGIN NOW She was crying! END
BEGIN NOW and I have to be told about it!&mdash;and I was quietly eating my dinner, like an idiot, all the time&mdash;I, who would sell the Father, Son and Holy Ghost to save one tear to either of them. END
BEGIN NOW An honest man! END
BEGIN NOW said Eugene to himself as he lay down. END
BEGIN NOW Upon my word, I think I will be an honest man all my life; it is so pleasant to obey the voice of conscience. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps none but believers in God do good in secret; and Eugene believed in a God. END
BEGIN NOW The next day Rastignac went at the appointed time to de Beauseant, who took him with her to the Duchesse de Carigliano's ball. END
BEGIN NOW The Marechale received Eugene most graciously. END
BEGIN NOW de Nucingen was there. END
BEGIN NOW Delphine's dress seemed to suggest that she wished for the admiration of others, so that she might shine the more in Eugene's eyes; she was eagerly expecting a glance from him, hiding, as she thought, this eagerness from all beholders. END
BEGIN NOW This moment is full of charm for one who can guess all that passes in a woman's mind. END
BEGIN NOW Who has not refrained from giving his opinion, to prolong her suspense, concealing his pleasure from a desire to tantalize, seeking a confession of love in her uneasiness, enjoying the fears that he can dissipate by a smile? END
BEGIN NOW In the course of the evening the law student suddenly comprehended his position; he saw that, as the cousin of de Beauseant, he was a personage in this world. END
BEGIN NOW He was already credited with the conquest of de Nucingen, and for this reason was a conspicuous figure; he caught the envious glances of other young men, and experienced the earliest pleasures of coxcombry. END
BEGIN NOW People wondered at his luck, and scraps of these conversations came to his ears as he went from room to room; all the women prophesied his success; and Delphine, in her dread of losing him, promised that this evening she would not refuse the kiss that all his entreaties could scarcely win yesterday. END
BEGIN NOW Rastignac received several invitations. END
BEGIN NOW His cousin presented him to other women who were present; women who could claim to be of the highest fashion; whose houses were looked upon as pleasant; and this was the loftiest and most fashionable society in Paris into which he was launched. END
BEGIN NOW So this evening had all the charm of a brilliant debut; it was an evening that he was to remember even in old age, as a woman looks back upon her first ball and the memories of her girlish triumphs. END
BEGIN NOW The next morning, at breakfast, he related the story of his success for the benefit of Father Goriot and the lodgers. END
BEGIN NOW Vautrin began to smile in a diabolical fashion. END
BEGIN NOW And do you suppose, cried that cold-blooded logician, that a young man of fashion can live here in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve, in the Maison Vauquer&mdash;an exceedingly respectable boarding-house in every way, I grant you, but an establishment that, none the less, falls short of being fashionable? END
BEGIN NOW The house is comfortable, it is lordly in its abundance; it is proud to be the temporary abode of a Rastignac; but, after all, it is in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve, and luxury would be out of place here, where we only aim at the purely _patriarchalorama_. END
BEGIN NOW If you mean to cut a figure in Paris, my young friend, Vautrin continued, with half-paternal jocularity, you must have three horses, a tilbury for the mornings, and a closed carriage for the evening; you should spend altogether about nine thousand francs on your stables. END
BEGIN NOW You would show yourself unworthy of your destiny if you spent no more than three thousand francs with your tailor, six hundred in perfumery, a hundred crowns to your shoemaker, and a hundred more to your hatter. END
BEGIN NOW As for your laundress, there goes another thousand francs; a young man of fashion must of necessity make a great point of his linen; if your linen comes up to the required standard, people often do not look any further. END
BEGIN NOW Love and the Church demand a fair altar-cloth. END
BEGIN NOW That is fourteen thousand francs. END
BEGIN NOW I am saying nothing of losses at play, bets, and presents; it is impossible to allow less than two thousand francs for pocket money. END
BEGIN NOW I have led that sort of life, and I know all about these expenses. END
BEGIN NOW Add the cost of necessaries next; three hundred louis for provender, a thousand francs for a place to roost in. END
BEGIN NOW Well, my boy, for all these little wants of ours we had need to have twenty-five thousand francs every year in our purse, or we shall find ourselves in the kennel, and people laughing at us, and our career is cut short, good-bye to success, and good-bye to your mistress! END
BEGIN NOW I am forgetting your valet and your groom! END
BEGIN NOW Is Christophe going to carry your _billets-doux_ for you? END
BEGIN NOW Do you mean to employ the stationery you use at present? END
BEGIN NOW Suicidal policy! END
BEGIN NOW Hearken to the wisdom of your elders! END
BEGIN NOW he went on, his bass voice growing louder at each syllable. END
BEGIN NOW Either take up your quarters in a garret, live virtuously, and wed your work, or set about the thing in a different way. END
BEGIN NOW Vautrin winked and leered in the direction of Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Taillefer to enforce his remarks by a look which recalled the late tempting proposals by which he had sought to corrupt the student's mind. END
BEGIN NOW Several days went by, and Rastignac lived in a whirl of gaiety. END
BEGIN NOW He dined almost every day with de Nucingen, and went wherever she went, only returning to the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve in the small hours. END
BEGIN NOW He rose at mid-day, and dressed to go into the Bois with Delphine if the day was fine, squandering in this way time that was worth far more than he knew. END
BEGIN NOW He turned as eagerly to learn the lessons of luxury, and was as quick to feel its fascination, as the flowers of the date palm to receive the fertilizing pollen. END
BEGIN NOW He played high, lost and won large sums of money, and at last became accustomed to the extravagant life that young men lead in Paris. END
BEGIN NOW He sent fifteen hundred francs out of his first winnings to his mother and sisters, sending handsome presents as well as the money. END
BEGIN NOW He had given out that he meant to leave the Maison Vauquer; but January came and went, and he was still there, still unprepared to go. END
BEGIN NOW One rule holds good of most young men&mdash;whether rich or poor. END
BEGIN NOW They never have money for the necessaries of life, but they have always money to spare for their caprices&mdash;an anomaly which finds its explanation in their youth and in the almost frantic eagerness with which youth grasps at pleasure. END
BEGIN NOW They are reckless with anything obtained on credit, while everything for which they must pay in ready money is made to last as long as possible; if they cannot have all that they want, they make up for it, it would seem, by squandering what they have. END
BEGIN NOW To state the matter simply&mdash;a student is far more careful of his hat than of his coat, because the latter being a comparatively costly article of dress, it is in the nature of things that a tailor should be a creditor; but it is otherwise with the hatter; the sums of money spent with him are so modest, that he is the most independent and unmanageable of his tribe, and it is almost impossible to bring him to terms. END
BEGIN NOW The young man in the balcony of a theatre who displays a gorgeous waistcoat for the benefit of the fair owners of opera glasses, has very probably no socks in his wardrobe, for the hosier is another of the genus of weevils that nibble at the purse. END
BEGIN NOW This was Rastignac's condition. END
BEGIN NOW His purse was always empty for Vauquer, always full at the demand of vanity; there was a periodical ebb and flow in his fortunes, which was seldom favorable to the payment of just debts. END
BEGIN NOW If he was to leave that unsavory and mean abode, where from time to time his pretensions met with humiliation, the first step was to pay his hostess for a month's board and lodging, and the second to purchase furniture worthy of the new lodgings he must take in his quality of dandy, a course that remained impossible. END
BEGIN NOW Rastignac, out of his winnings at cards, would pay his jeweler exorbitant prices for gold watches and chains, and then, to meet the exigencies of play, would carry them to the pawnbroker, that discreet and forbidding-looking friend of youth; but when it was a question of paying for board or lodging, or for the necessary implements for the cultivation of his Elysian fields, his imagination and pluck alike deserted him. END
BEGIN NOW There was no inspiration to be found in vulgar necessity, in debts contracted for past requirements. END
BEGIN NOW Like most of those who trust to their luck, he put off till the last moment the payment of debts that among the bourgeoisie are regarded as sacred engagements, acting on the plan of Mirabeau, who never settled his baker's bill until it underwent a formidable transformation into a bill of exchange. END
BEGIN NOW It was about this time when Rastignac was down on his luck and fell into debt, that it became clear to the law student's mind that he must have some more certain source of income if he meant to live as he had been doing. END
BEGIN NOW But while he groaned over the thorny problems of his precarious situation, he felt that he could not bring himself to renounce the pleasures of this extravagant life, and decided that he must continue it at all costs. END
BEGIN NOW His dreams of obtaining a fortune appeared more and more chimerical, and the real obstacles grew more formidable. END
BEGIN NOW His initiation into the secrets of the Nucingen household had revealed to him that if he were to attempt to use this love affair as a means of mending his fortunes, he must swallow down all sense of decency, and renounce all the generous ideas which redeem the sins of youth. END
BEGIN NOW He had chosen this life of apparent splendor, but secretly gnawed by the canker worm of remorse, a life of fleeting pleasure dearly paid for by persistent pain; like _Le Distrait_ of La Bruyere, he had descended so far as to make his bed in a ditch; but (also like _Le Distrait_) he himself was uncontaminated as yet by the mire that stained his garments. END
BEGIN NOW So we have killed our mandarin, have we? END
BEGIN NOW said Bianchon one day as they left the dinner table. END
BEGIN NOW Not yet, he answered, but he is at his last gasp. END
BEGIN NOW The medical student took this for a joke, but it was not a jest. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene had dined in the house that night for the first time for a long while, and had looked thoughtful during the meal. END
BEGIN NOW He had taken his place beside Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Taillefer, and stayed through the dessert, giving his neighbor an expressive glance from time to time. END
BEGIN NOW A few of the boarders discussed the walnuts at the table, and others walked about the room, still taking part in the conversation which had begun among them. END
BEGIN NOW People usually went when they chose; the amount of time that they lingered being determined by the amount of interest that the conversation possessed for them, or by the difficulty of the process of digestion. END
BEGIN NOW In winter-time the room was seldom empty before eight o'clock, when the four women had it all to themselves, and made up for the silence previously imposed upon them by the preponderating masculine element. END
BEGIN NOW This evening Vautrin had noticed Eugene's abstractedness, and stayed in the room, though he had seemed to be in a hurry to finish his dinner and go. END
BEGIN NOW All through the talk afterwards he had kept out of the sight of the law student, who quite believed that Vautrin had left the room. END
BEGIN NOW He now took up his position cunningly in the sitting-room instead of going when the last boarders went. END
BEGIN NOW He had fathomed the young man's thoughts, and felt that a crisis was at hand. END
BEGIN NOW Rastignac was, in fact, in a dilemma, which many another young man must have known. END
BEGIN NOW de Nucingen might love him, or might merely be playing with him, but in either case Rastignac had been made to experience all the alternations of hope and despair of genuine passion, and all the diplomatic arts of a Parisienne had been employed on him. END
BEGIN NOW After compromising herself by continually appearing in public with de Beauseant's cousin she still hesitated, and would not give him the lover's privileges which he appeared to enjoy. END
BEGIN NOW For a whole month she had so wrought on his senses, that at last she had made an impression on his heart. END
BEGIN NOW If in the earliest days the student had fancied himself to be master, de Nucingen had since become the stronger of the two, for she had skilfully roused and played upon every instinct, good or bad, in the two or three men comprised in a young student in Paris. END
BEGIN NOW This was not the result of deep design on her part, nor was she playing a part, for women are in a manner true to themselves even through their grossest deceit, because their actions are prompted by a natural impulse. END
BEGIN NOW It may have been that Delphine, who had allowed this young man to gain such an ascendency over her, conscious that she had been too demonstrative, was obeying a sentiment of dignity, and either repented of her concessions, or it pleased her to suspend them. END
BEGIN NOW It is so natural to a Parisienne, even when passion has almost mastered her, to hesitate and pause before taking the plunge; to probe the heart of him to whom she intrusts her future. END
BEGIN NOW And once already de Nucingen's hopes had been betrayed, and her loyalty to a selfish young lover had been despised. END
BEGIN NOW She had good reason to be suspicious. END
BEGIN NOW Or it may have been that something in Eugene's manner (for his rapid success was making a coxcomb of him) had warned her that the grotesque nature of their position had lowered her somewhat in his eyes. END
BEGIN NOW She doubtless wished to assert her dignity; he was young, and she would be great in his eyes; for the lover who had forsaken her had held her so cheap that she was determined that Eugene should not think her an easy conquest, and for this very reason&mdash;he knew that de Marsay had been his predecessor. END
BEGIN NOW Finally, after the degradation of submission to the pleasure of a heartless young rake, it was so sweet to her to wander in the flower-strewn realms of love, that it was not wonderful that she should wish to dwell a while on the prospect, to tremble with the vibrations of love, to feel the freshness of the breath of its dawn. END
BEGIN NOW The true lover was suffering for the sins of the false. END
BEGIN NOW This inconsistency is unfortunately only to be expected so long as men do not know how many flowers are mown down in a young woman's soul by the first stroke of treachery. END
BEGIN NOW Whatever her reasons may have been, Delphine was playing with Rastignac, and took pleasure in playing with him, doubtless because she felt sure of his love, and confident that she could put an end to the torture as soon as it was her royal pleasure to do so. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene's self-love was engaged; he could not suffer his first passage of love to end in a defeat, and persisted in his suit like a sportsman determined to bring down at least one partridge to celebrate his first Feast of Saint-Hubert. END
BEGIN NOW The pressure of anxiety, his wounded self-love, his despair, real or feigned, drew him nearer and nearer to this woman. END
BEGIN NOW All Paris credited him with this conquest, and yet he was conscious that he had made no progress since the day when he saw de Nucingen for the first time. END
BEGIN NOW He did not know as yet that a woman's coquetry is sometimes more delightful than the pleasure of secure possession of her love, and was possessed with helpless rage. END
BEGIN NOW If, at this time, while she denied herself to love, Eugene gathered the springtide spoils of his life, the fruit, somewhat sharp and green, and dearly bought, was no less delicious to the taste. END
BEGIN NOW There were moments when he had not a sou in his pockets, and at such times he thought in spite of his conscience of Vautrin's offer and the possibility of fortune by a marriage with Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Taillefer. END
BEGIN NOW Poverty would clamor so loudly that more than once he was on the point of yielding to the cunning temptations of the terrible sphinx, whose glance had so often exerted a strange spell over him. END
BEGIN NOW Poiret and Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau went up to their rooms; and Rastignac, thinking that he was alone with the women in the dining-room, sat between Vauquer and Couture, who was nodding over the woolen cuffs that she was knitting by the stove, and looked at Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Taillefer so tenderly that she lowered her eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Can you be in trouble, M. Eugene? END
BEGIN NOW Victorine said after a pause. END
BEGIN NOW Who has not his troubles? END
BEGIN NOW answered Rastignac. END
BEGIN NOW If we men were sure of being loved, sure of a devotion which would be our reward for the sacrifices which we are always ready to make, then perhaps we should have no troubles. END
BEGIN NOW For answer Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Taillefer only gave him a glance but it was impossible to mistake its meaning. END
BEGIN NOW You, for instance, mademoiselle; you feel sure of your heart to-day, but are you sure that it will never change? END
BEGIN NOW A smile flitted over the poor girl's lips; it seemed as if a ray of light from her soul had lighted up her face. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene was dismayed at the sudden explosion of feeling caused by his words. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW but suppose, he said, that you should be rich and happy to-morrow, suppose that a vast fortune dropped down from the clouds for you, would you still love the man whom you loved in your days of poverty? END
BEGIN NOW A charming movement of the head was her only answer. END
BEGIN NOW Even if he were very poor? END
BEGIN NOW Again the same mute answer. END
BEGIN NOW What nonsense are you talking, you two? END
BEGIN NOW exclaimed Vauquer. END
BEGIN NOW Never mind, answered Eugene; we understand each other. END
BEGIN NOW So there is to be an engagement of marriage between M. le Chevalier Eugene de Rastignac and Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Victorine Taillefer, is there? END
BEGIN NOW The words were uttered in Vautrin's deep voice, and Vautrin appeared at the door as he spoke. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW how you startled me! END
BEGIN NOW Couture and Vauquer exclaimed together. END
BEGIN NOW I might make a worse choice, said Rastignac, laughing. END
BEGIN NOW Vautrin's voice had thrown him into the most painful agitation that he had yet known. END
BEGIN NOW No bad jokes, gentlemen! END
BEGIN NOW said Couture. END
BEGIN NOW My dear, let us go upstairs. END
BEGIN NOW Vauquer followed the two ladies, meaning to pass the evening in their room, an arrangement that economized fire and candlelight. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene and Vautrin were left alone. END
BEGIN NOW I felt sure you would come round to it, said the elder man with the coolness that nothing seemed to shake. END
BEGIN NOW But stay a moment! END
BEGIN NOW I have as much delicacy as anybody else. END
BEGIN NOW Don't make up your mind on the spur of the moment; you are a little thrown off your balance just now. END
BEGIN NOW You are in debt, and I want you to come over to my way of thinking after sober reflection, and not in a fit of passion or desperation. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps you want a thousand crowns. END
BEGIN NOW There, you can have them if you like. END
BEGIN NOW The tempter took out a pocketbook, and drew thence three banknotes, which he fluttered before the student's eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene was in a most painful dilemma. END
BEGIN NOW He had debts, debts of honor. END
BEGIN NOW He owed a hundred louis to the Marquis d'Ajuda and to the Count de Trailles; he had not the money, and for this reason had not dared to go to de Restaud's house, where he was expected that evening. END
BEGIN NOW It was one of those informal gatherings where tea and little cakes are handed round, but where it is possible to lose six thousand francs at whist in the course of a night. END
BEGIN NOW You must see, said Eugene, struggling to hide a convulsive tremor, that after what has passed between us, I cannot possibly lay myself under any obligation to you. END
BEGIN NOW Quite right; I should be sorry to hear you speak otherwise, answered the tempter. END
BEGIN NOW You are a fine young fellow, honorable, brave as a lion, and as gentle as a young girl. END
BEGIN NOW You would be a fine haul for the devil! END
BEGIN NOW I like youngsters of your sort. END
BEGIN NOW Get rid of one or two more prejudices, and you will see the world as it is. END
BEGIN NOW Make a little scene now and then, and act a virtuous part in it, and a man with a head on his shoulders can do exactly as he likes amid deafening applause from the fools in the gallery. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW a few days yet, and you will be with us; and if you would only be tutored by me, I would put you in the way of achieving all your ambitions. END
BEGIN NOW You should no sooner form a wish than it should be realized to the full; you should have all your desires&mdash;honors, wealth, or women. END
BEGIN NOW Civilization should flow with milk and honey for you. END
BEGIN NOW You should be our pet and favorite, our Benjamin. END
BEGIN NOW We would all work ourselves to death for you with pleasure; every obstacle should be removed from your path. END
BEGIN NOW You have a few prejudices left; so you think that I am a scoundrel, do you? END
BEGIN NOW Well, M. de Turenne, quite as honorable a man as you take yourself to be, had some little private transactions with bandits, and did not feel that his honor was tarnished. END
BEGIN NOW You would rather not lie under any obligation to me, eh? END
BEGIN NOW You need not draw back on that account, Vautrin went on, and a smile stole over his lips. END
BEGIN NOW Take these bits of paper and write across this, he added, producing a piece of stamped paper, _Accepted the sum of three thousand five hundred francs due this day twelvemonth_, and fill in the date. END
BEGIN NOW The rate of interest is stiff enough to silence any scruples on your part; it gives you the right to call me a Jew. END
BEGIN NOW You can call quits with me on the score of gratitude. END
BEGIN NOW I am quite willing that you should despise me to-day, because I am sure that you will have a kindlier feeling towards me later on. END
BEGIN NOW You will find out fathomless depths in my nature, enormous and concentrated forces that weaklings call vices, but you will never find me base or ungrateful. END
BEGIN NOW In short, I am neither a pawn nor a bishop, but a castle, a tower of strength, my boy. END
BEGIN NOW What manner of man are you? END
BEGIN NOW cried Eugene. END
BEGIN NOW Were you created to torment me? END
BEGIN NOW Why no; I am a good-natured fellow, who is willing to do a dirty piece of work to put you high and dry above the mire for the rest of your days. END
BEGIN NOW Do you ask the reason of this devotion? END
BEGIN NOW All right; I will tell you that some of these days. END
BEGIN NOW A word or two in your ear will explain it. END
BEGIN NOW I have begun by shocking you, by showing you the way to ring the changes, and giving you a sight of the mechanism of the social machine; but your first fright will go off like a conscript's terror on the battlefield. END
BEGIN NOW You will grow used to regarding men as common soldiers who have made up their minds to lose their lives for some self-constituted king. END
BEGIN NOW Times have altered strangely. END
BEGIN NOW Once you could say to a bravo, 'Here are a hundred crowns; go and kill Monsieur So-and-so for me,' and you could sup quietly after turning some one off into the dark for the least thing in the world. END
BEGIN NOW But nowadays I propose to put you in the way of a handsome fortune; you have only to nod your head, it won't compromise you in any way, and you hesitate. END
BEGIN NOW 'Tis an effeminate age. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene accepted the draft, and received the banknotes in exchange for it. END
BEGIN NOW Well, well. END
BEGIN NOW Come, now, let us talk rationally, Vautrin continued. END
BEGIN NOW I mean to leave this country in a few months' time for America, and set about planting tobacco. END
BEGIN NOW I will send you the cigars of friendship. END
BEGIN NOW If I make money at it, I will help you in your career. END
BEGIN NOW If I have no children&mdash;which will probably be the case, for I have no anxiety to raise slips of myself here&mdash;you shall inherit my fortune. END
BEGIN NOW That is what you may call standing by a man; but I myself have a liking for you. END
BEGIN NOW I have a mania, too, for devoting myself to some one else. END
BEGIN NOW I have done it before. END
BEGIN NOW You see, my boy, I live in a loftier sphere than other men do; I look on all actions as means to an end, and the end is all that I look at. END
BEGIN NOW What is a man's life to me? END
BEGIN NOW Not _that_, he said, and he snapped his thumb-nail against his teeth. END
BEGIN NOW A man, in short, is everything to me, or just nothing at all. END
BEGIN NOW Less than nothing if his name happens to be Poiret; you can crush him like a bug, he is flat and he is offensive. END
BEGIN NOW But a man is a god when he is like you; he is not a machine covered with a skin, but a theatre in which the greatest sentiments are displayed&mdash;great thoughts and feelings&mdash;and for these, and these only, I live. END
BEGIN NOW A sentiment&mdash;what is that but the whole world in a thought? END
BEGIN NOW Look at Father Goriot. END
BEGIN NOW For him, his two girls are the whole universe; they are the clue by which he finds his way through creation. END
BEGIN NOW Well, for my own part, I have fathomed the depths of life, there is only one real sentiment&mdash;comradeship between man and man. END
BEGIN NOW Pierre and Jaffier, that is my passion. END
BEGIN NOW I knew _Venice Preserved_ by heart. END
BEGIN NOW Have you met many men plucky enough when a comrade says, 'Let us bury a dead body!' END
BEGIN NOW to go and do it without a word or plaguing him by taking a high moral tone? END
BEGIN NOW I have done it myself. END
BEGIN NOW I should not talk like this to just everybody, but you are not like an ordinary man; one can talk to you, you can understand things. END
BEGIN NOW You will not dabble about much longer among the tadpoles in these swamps. END
BEGIN NOW Well, then, it is all settled. END
BEGIN NOW You will marry. END
BEGIN NOW Both of us carry our point. END
BEGIN NOW Mine is made of iron, and will never soften, he! END
BEGIN NOW he! END
BEGIN NOW Vautrin went out. END
BEGIN NOW He would not wait to hear the student's repudiation, he wished to put Eugene at his ease. END
BEGIN NOW He seemed to understand the secret springs of the faint resistance still made by the younger man; the struggles in which men seek to preserve their self-respect by justifying their blameworthy actions to themselves. END
BEGIN NOW He may do as he likes; I shall not marry Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Taillefer, that is certain, said Eugene to himself. END
BEGIN NOW He regarded this man with abhorrence, and yet the very cynicism of Vautrin's ideas, and the audacious way in which he used other men for his own ends, raised him in the student's eyes; but the thought of a compact threw Eugene into a fever of apprehension, and not until he had recovered somewhat did he dress, call for a cab, and go to de Restaud's. END
BEGIN NOW For some days the Countess had paid more and more attention to a young man whose every step seemed a triumphal progress in the great world; it seemed to her that he might be a formidable power before long. END
BEGIN NOW He paid Messieurs de Trailles and d'Ajuda, played at whist for part of the evening, and made good his losses. END
BEGIN NOW Most men who have their way to make are more or less of fatalists, and Eugene was superstitious; he chose to consider that his luck was heaven's reward for his perseverance in the right way. END
BEGIN NOW As soon as possible on the following morning he asked Vautrin whether the bill he had given was still in the other's possession; and on receiving a reply in the affirmative, he repaid the three thousand francs with a not unnatural relief. END
BEGIN NOW Everything is going on well, said Vautrin. END
BEGIN NOW But I am not your accomplice, said Eugene. END
BEGIN NOW I know, I know, Vautrin broke in. END
BEGIN NOW You are still acting like a child. END
BEGIN NOW You are making mountains out of molehills at the outset. END
BEGIN NOW Two days later, Poiret and Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau were sitting together on a bench in the sun. END
BEGIN NOW They had chosen a little frequented alley in the Jardin des Plantes, and a gentleman was chatting with them, the same person, as a matter of fact, about whom the medical student had, not without good reason, his own suspicions. END
BEGIN NOW Mademoiselle, this M. Gondureau was saying, I do not see any cause for your scruples. END
BEGIN NOW His Excellency, Monseigneur the Minister of Police&mdash;- Yes, his Excellency is taking a personal interest in the matter, said Gondureau. END
BEGIN NOW Who would think it probable that Poiret, a retired clerk, doubtless possessed of some notions of civic virtue, though there might be nothing else in his head&mdash;who would think it likely that such a man would continue to lend an ear to this supposed independent gentleman of the Rue de Buffon, when the latter dropped the mask of a decent citizen by that word police, and gave a glimpse of the features of a detective from the Rue de Jerusalem? END
BEGIN NOW And yet nothing was more natural. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps the following remarks from the hitherto unpublished records made by certain observers will throw a light on the particular species to which Poiret belonged in the great family of fools. END
BEGIN NOW There is a race of quill-drivers, confined in the columns of the budget between the first degree of latitude (a kind of administrative Greenland where the salaries begin at twelve hundred francs) to the third degree, a more temperate zone, where incomes grow from three to six thousand francs, a climate where the _bonus_ flourishes like a half-hardy annual in spite of some difficulties of culture. END
BEGIN NOW A characteristic trait that best reveals the feeble narrow-mindedness of these inhabitants of petty officialdom is a kind of involuntary, mechanical, and instinctive reverence for the Grand Lama of every Ministry, known to the rank and file only by his signature (an illegible scrawl) and by his title&mdash; His Excellency Monseigneur le Ministre, five words which produce as much effect as the _il Bondo Cani_ of the _Calife de Bagdad_, five words which in the eyes of this low order of intelligence represent a sacred power from which there is no appeal. END
BEGIN NOW The Minister is administratively infallible for the clerks in the employ of the Government, as the Pope is infallible for good Catholics. END
BEGIN NOW Something of this peculiar radiance invests everything he does or says, or that is said or done in his name; the robe of office covers everything and legalizes everything done by his orders; does not his very title&mdash;His Excellency&mdash;vouch for the purity of his intentions and the righteousness of his will, and serve as a sort of passport and introduction to ideas that otherwise would not be entertained for a moment? END
BEGIN NOW Pronounce the words His Excellency, and these poor folk will forthwith proceed to do what they would not do for their own interests. END
BEGIN NOW Passive obedience is as well known in a Government department as in the army itself; and the administrative system silences consciences, annihilates the individual, and ends (give it time enough) by fashioning a man into a vise or a thumbscrew, and he becomes part of the machinery of Government. END
BEGIN NOW Wherefore, M. Gondureau, who seemed to know something of human nature, recognized Poiret at once as one of those dupes of officialdom, and brought out for his benefit, at the proper moment, the _deus ex machina_, the magical words His Excellency, so as to dazzle Poiret just as he himself unmasked his batteries, for he took Poiret and the Michonneau for the male and female of the same species. END
BEGIN NOW If his Excellency himself, his Excellency the Minister... Ah! END
BEGIN NOW that is quite another thing, said Poiret. END
BEGIN NOW You seem to be guided by this gentleman's opinion, and you hear what he says, said the man of independent means, addressing Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau. END
BEGIN NOW Very well, his Excellency is at this moment absolutely certain that the so-called Vautrin, who lodges at the Maison Vauquer, is a convict who escaped from penal servitude at Toulon, where he is known by the nickname _Trompe-la-Mort_. END
BEGIN NOW Trompe-la-Mort? END
BEGIN NOW said Pioret. END
BEGIN NOW Dear me, he is very lucky if he deserves that nickname. END
BEGIN NOW Well, yes, said the detective. END
BEGIN NOW They call him so because he has been so lucky as not to lose his life in the very risky businesses that he has carried through. END
BEGIN NOW He is a dangerous man, you see! END
BEGIN NOW He has qualities that are out of the common; the thing he is wanted for, in fact, was a matter which gained him no end of credit with his own set&mdash;- Then is he a man of honor? END
BEGIN NOW asked Poiret. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, according to his notions. END
BEGIN NOW He agreed to take another man's crime upon himself&mdash;a forgery committed by a very handsome young fellow that he had taken a great fancy to, a young Italian, a bit of a gambler, who has since gone into the army, where his conduct has been unexceptionable. END
BEGIN NOW But if his Excellency the Minister of Police is certain that M. Vautrin is this _Trompe-la-Mort_, why should he want me? END
BEGIN NOW asked Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau. END
BEGIN NOW Oh yes, said Poiret, if the Minister, as you have been so obliging as to tell us, really knows for a certainty&mdash;- Certainty is not the word; he only suspects. END
BEGIN NOW You will soon understand how things are. END
BEGIN NOW Jacques Collin, nicknamed _Trompe-la-Mort_, is in the confidence of every convict in the three prisons; he is their man of business and their banker. END
BEGIN NOW He makes a very good thing out of managing their affairs, which want a _man of mark_ to see about them. END
BEGIN NOW Ha! END
BEGIN NOW ha! END
BEGIN NOW do you see the pun, mademoiselle? END
BEGIN NOW asked Poiret. END
BEGIN NOW This gentleman calls himself a _man of mark_ because he is a _marked man_&mdash;branded, you know. END
BEGIN NOW This so-called Vautrin, said the detective, receives the money belonging to my lords the convicts, invests it for them, and holds it at the disposal of those who escape, or hands it over to their families if they leave a will, or to their mistresses when they draw upon him for their benefit. END
BEGIN NOW Their mistresses! END
BEGIN NOW You mean their wives, remarked Poiret. END
BEGIN NOW No, sir. END
BEGIN NOW A convict's wife is usually an illegitimate connection. END
BEGIN NOW We call them concubines. END
BEGIN NOW Then they all live in a state of concubinage? END
BEGIN NOW Naturally. END
BEGIN NOW Why, these are abominations that his Excellency ought not to allow. END
BEGIN NOW Since you have the honor of seeing his Excellency, you, who seem to have philanthropic ideas, ought really to enlighten him as to their immoral conduct&mdash;they are setting a shocking example to the rest of society. END
BEGIN NOW But the Government does not hold them up as models of all the virtues, my dear sir&mdash;- Of course not, sir; but still&mdash;- Just let the gentleman say what he has to say, dearie, said Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau. END
BEGIN NOW You see how it is, mademoiselle, Gondureau continued. END
BEGIN NOW The Government may have the strongest reasons for getting this illicit hoard into its hands; it mounts up to something considerable, by all that we can make out. END
BEGIN NOW Trompe-la-Mort not only holds large sums for his friends the convicts, but he has other amounts which are paid over to him by the Society of the Ten Thousand&mdash;- Ten Thousand Thieves! END
BEGIN NOW cried Pioret in alarm. END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW The Society of the Ten Thousand is not an association of petty offenders, but of people who set about their work on a large scale&mdash;they won't touch a matter unless there are ten thousand francs in it. END
BEGIN NOW It is composed of the most distinguished of the men who are sent straight to the Assize Courts when they come up for trial. END
BEGIN NOW They know the Code too well to risk their necks when they are nabbed. END
BEGIN NOW Collin is their confidential agent and legal adviser. END
BEGIN NOW By means of the large sums of money at his disposal he has established a sort of detective system of his own; it is widespread and mysterious in its workings. END
BEGIN NOW We have had spies all about him for a twelvemonth, and yet we could not manage to fathom his games. END
BEGIN NOW His capital and his cleverness are at the service of vice and crime; this money furnishes the necessary funds for a regular army of blackguards in his pay who wage incessant war against society. END
BEGIN NOW If we can catch Trompe-la-Mort, and take possession of his funds, we should strike at the root of this evil. END
BEGIN NOW So this job is a kind of Government affair&mdash;a State secret&mdash;and likely to redound to the honor of those who bring the thing to a successful conclusion. END
BEGIN NOW You, sir, for instance, might very well be taken into a Government department again; they might make you secretary to a Commissary of Police; you could accept that post without prejudice to your retiring pension. END
BEGIN NOW Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau interposed at this point with, What is there to hinder Trompe-la-Mort from making off with the money? END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW said the detective, a man is told off to follow him everywhere he goes, with orders to kill him if he were to rob the convicts. END
BEGIN NOW Then it is not quite as easy to make off with a lot of money as it is to run away with a young lady of family. END
BEGIN NOW Besides, Collin is not the sort of fellow to play such a trick; he would be disgraced, according to his notions. END
BEGIN NOW You are quite right, sir, said Poiret, utterly disgraced he would be. END
BEGIN NOW But none of all this explains why you do not come and take him without more ado, remarked Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau. END
BEGIN NOW Very well, mademoiselle, I will explain&mdash;but, he added in her ear, keep your companion quiet, or I shall never have done. END
BEGIN NOW The old boy ought to pay people handsomely for listening to him.&mdash;Trompe-la-Mort, when he came back here, he went on aloud slipped into the skin of an honest man; he turned up disguised as a decent Parisian citizen, and took up his quarters in an unpretending lodging-house. END
BEGIN NOW He is cunning, that he is! END
BEGIN NOW You don't catch him napping. END
BEGIN NOW Then M. Vautrin is a man of consequence, who transacts a good deal of business. END
BEGIN NOW Naturally, said Poiret to himself. END
BEGIN NOW And suppose that the Minister were to make a mistake and get hold of the real Vautrin, he would put every one's back up among the business men in Paris, and public opinion would be against him. END
BEGIN NOW M. le Prefet de Police is on slippery ground; he has enemies. END
BEGIN NOW They would take advantage of any mistake. END
BEGIN NOW There would be a fine outcry and fuss made by the Opposition, and he would be sent packing. END
BEGIN NOW We must set about this just as we did about the Coignard affair, the sham Comte de Sainte-Helene; if he had been the real Comte de Sainte-Helene, we should have been in the wrong box. END
BEGIN NOW We want to be quite sure what we are about. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, but what you want is a pretty woman, said Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau briskly. END
BEGIN NOW Trompe-la-Mort would not let a woman come near him, said the detective. END
BEGIN NOW I will tell you a secret&mdash;he does not like them. END
BEGIN NOW Still, I do not see what I can do, supposing that I did agree to identify him for two thousand francs. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing simpler, said the stranger. END
BEGIN NOW I will send you a little bottle containing a dose that will send a rush of blood to the head; it will do him no harm whatever, but he will fall down as if he were in a fit. END
BEGIN NOW The drug can be put into wine or coffee; either will do equally well. END
BEGIN NOW You carry your man to bed at once, and undress him to see that he is not dying. END
BEGIN NOW As soon as you are alone, you give him a slap on the shoulder, and _presto!_ the letters will appear. END
BEGIN NOW Why, that is just nothing at all, said Poiret. END
BEGIN NOW Well, do you agree? END
BEGIN NOW said Gondureau, addressing the old maid. END
BEGIN NOW But, my dear sir, suppose there are no letters at all, said Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau; am I to have the two thousand francs all the same? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW What will you give me then? END
BEGIN NOW Five hundred francs. END
BEGIN NOW It is such a thing to do for so little! END
BEGIN NOW It lies on your conscience just the same, and I must quiet my conscience, sir. END
BEGIN NOW I assure you, said Poiret, that mademoiselle has a great deal of conscience, and not only so, she is a very amiable person, and very intelligent. END
BEGIN NOW Well, now, Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau went on, make it three thousand francs if he is Trompe-la-Mort, and nothing at all if he is an ordinary man. END
BEGIN NOW Done! END
BEGIN NOW said Gondureau, but on the condition that the thing is settled to-morrow. END
BEGIN NOW Not quite so soon, my dear sir; I must consult my confessor first. END
BEGIN NOW You are a sly one, said the detective as he rose to his feet. END
BEGIN NOW Good-bye till to-morrow, then. END
BEGIN NOW And if you should want to see me in a hurry, go to the Petite Rue Saint-Anne at the bottom of the Cour de la Sainte-Chapelle. END
BEGIN NOW There is one door under the archway. END
BEGIN NOW Ask there for M. Gondureau. END
BEGIN NOW Bianchon, on his way back from Cuvier's lecture, overheard the sufficiently striking nickname of _Trompe-la-Mort_, and caught the celebrated chief detective's _Done!_ Why didn't you close with him? END
BEGIN NOW It would be three hundred francs a year, said Poiret to Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau. END
BEGIN NOW Why didn't I? END
BEGIN NOW she asked. END
BEGIN NOW Why, it wants thinking over. END
BEGIN NOW Suppose that M. Vautrin is this Trompe-la-Mort, perhaps we might do better for ourselves with him. END
BEGIN NOW Still, on the other hand, if you ask him for money, it would put him on his guard, and he is just the man to clear out without paying, and that would be an abominable sell. END
BEGIN NOW And suppose you did warn him, Poiret went on, didn't that gentleman say that he was closely watched? END
BEGIN NOW You would spoil everything. END
BEGIN NOW Anyhow, thought Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau, I can't abide him. END
BEGIN NOW He says nothing but disagreeable things to me. END
BEGIN NOW But you can do better than that, Poiret resumed. END
BEGIN NOW As that gentleman said (and he seemed to me to be a very good sort of man, besides being very well got up), it is an act of obedience to the laws to rid society of a criminal, however virtuous he may be. END
BEGIN NOW Once a thief, always a thief. END
BEGIN NOW Suppose he were to take it into his head to murder us all? END
BEGIN NOW The deuce! END
BEGIN NOW We should be guilty of manslaughter, and be the first to fall victims into the bargain! END
BEGIN NOW Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau's musings did not permit her to listen very closely to the remarks that fell one by one from Poiret's lips like water dripping from a leaky tap. END
BEGIN NOW When once this elderly babbler began to talk, he would go on like clockwork unless Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau stopped him. END
BEGIN NOW He started on some subject or other, and wandered on through parenthesis after parenthesis, till he came to regions as remote as possible from his premises without coming to any conclusions by the way. END
BEGIN NOW By the time they reached the Maison Vauquer he had tacked together a whole string of examples and quotations more or less irrelevant to the subject in hand, which led him to give a full account of his own deposition in the case of the Sieur Ragoulleau _versus_ Dame Morin, when he had been summoned as a witness for the defence. END
BEGIN NOW As they entered the dining-room, Eugene de Rastignac was talking apart with Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Taillefer; the conversation appeared to be of such thrilling interest that the pair never noticed the two older lodgers as they passed through the room. END
BEGIN NOW None of this was thrown away on Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau. END
BEGIN NOW I knew how it would end, remarked that lady, addressing Poiret. END
BEGIN NOW They have been making eyes at each other in a heartrending way for a week past. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, he answered. END
BEGIN NOW So she was found guilty. END
BEGIN NOW Who? END
BEGIN NOW Morin. END
BEGIN NOW I am talking about Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Victorine, said Mlle, Michonneau, as she entered Poiret's room with an absent air, and you answer, ' Morin.' END
BEGIN NOW Who may Morin be? END
BEGIN NOW What can Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Victorine be guilty of? END
BEGIN NOW demanded Poiret. END
BEGIN NOW Guilty of falling in love with M. Eugene de Rastignac and going further and further without knowing exactly where she is going, poor innocent! END
BEGIN NOW That morning de Nucingen had driven Eugene to despair. END
BEGIN NOW In his own mind he had completely surrendered himself to Vautrin, and deliberately shut his eyes to the motive for the friendship which that extraordinary man professed for him, nor would he look to the consequences of such an alliance. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing short of a miracle could extricate him now out of the gulf into which he had walked an hour ago, when he exchanged vows in the softest whispers with Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Taillefer. END
BEGIN NOW To Victorine it seemed as if she heard an angel's voice, that heaven was opening above her; the Maison Vauquer took strange and wonderful hues, like a stage fairy-palace. END
BEGIN NOW She loved and she was loved; at any rate, she believed that she was loved; and what woman would not likewise have believed after seeing Rastignac's face and listening to the tones of his voice during that hour snatched under the Argus eyes of the Maison Vauquer? END
BEGIN NOW He had trampled on his conscience; he knew that he was doing wrong, and did it deliberately; he had said to himself that a woman's happiness should atone for this venial sin. END
BEGIN NOW The energy of desperation had lent new beauty to his face; the lurid fire that burned in his heart shone from his eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Luckily for him, the miracle took place. END
BEGIN NOW Vautrin came in in high spirits, and at once read the hearts of these two young creatures whom he had brought together by the combinations of his infernal genius, but his deep voice broke in upon their bliss. END
BEGIN NOW A charming girl is my Fanchette In her simplicity, he sang mockingly. END
BEGIN NOW Victorine fled. END
BEGIN NOW Her heart was more full than it had ever been, but it was full of joy, and not of sorrow. END
BEGIN NOW Poor child! END
BEGIN NOW A pressure of the hand, the light touch of Rastignac's hair against her cheek, a word whispered in her ear so closely that she felt the student's warm breath on her, the pressure of a trembling arm about her waist, a kiss upon her throat&mdash;such had been her betrothal. END
BEGIN NOW The near neighborhood of the stout Sylvie, who might invade that glorified room at any moment, only made these first tokens of love more ardent, more eloquent, more entrancing than the noblest deeds done for love's sake in the most famous romances. END
BEGIN NOW This _plain-song_ of love, to use the pretty expression of our forefathers, seemed almost criminal to the devout young girl who went to confession every fortnight. END
BEGIN NOW In that one hour she had poured out more of the treasures of her soul than she could give in later days of wealth and happiness, when her whole self followed the gift. END
BEGIN NOW The thing is arranged, Vautrin said to Eugene, who remained. END
BEGIN NOW Our two dandies have fallen out. END
BEGIN NOW Everything was done in proper form. END
BEGIN NOW It is a matter of opinion. END
BEGIN NOW Our pigeon has insulted my hawk. END
BEGIN NOW They will meet to-morrow in the redoubt at Clignancourt. END
BEGIN NOW By half-past eight in the morning Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Taillefer, calmly dipping her bread and butter in her coffee cup, will be sole heiress of her father's fortune and affections. END
BEGIN NOW A funny way of putting it, isn't it? END
BEGIN NOW Taillefer's youngster is an expert swordsman, and quite cocksure about it, but he will be bled; I have just invented a thrust for his benefit, a way of raising your sword point and driving it at the forehead. END
BEGIN NOW I must show you that thrust; it is an uncommonly handy thing to know. END
BEGIN NOW Rastignac heard him in dazed bewilderment; he could not find a word in reply. END
BEGIN NOW Just then Goriot came in, and Bianchon and a few of the boarders likewise appeared. END
BEGIN NOW That is just as I intended. END
BEGIN NOW Vautrin said. END
BEGIN NOW You know quite well what you are about. END
BEGIN NOW Good, my little eaglet! END
BEGIN NOW You are born to command, you are strong, you stand firm on your feet, you are game! END
BEGIN NOW I respect you. END
BEGIN NOW He made as though he would take Eugene's hand, but Rastignac hastily withdrew it, sank into a chair, and turned ghastly pale; it seemed to him that there was a sea of blood before his eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW so we still have a few dubious tatters of the swaddling clothes of virtue about us! END
BEGIN NOW murmured Vautrin. END
BEGIN NOW But Papa Doliban has three millions; I know the amount of his fortune. END
BEGIN NOW Once have her dowry in your hands, and your character will be as white as the bride's white dress, even in your own eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Rastignac hesitated no longer. END
BEGIN NOW He made up his mind that he would go that evening to warn the Taillefers, father and son. END
BEGIN NOW But just as Vautrin left him, Father Goriot came up and said in his ear, You look melancholy, my boy; I will cheer you up. END
BEGIN NOW Come with me. END
BEGIN NOW The old vermicelli dealer lighted his dip at one of the lamps as he spoke. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene went with him, his curiosity had been aroused. END
BEGIN NOW Let us go up to your room, the worthy soul remarked, when he had asked Sylvie for the law student's key. END
BEGIN NOW This morning, he resumed, you thought that _she_ did not care about you, did you not? END
BEGIN NOW Eh? END
BEGIN NOW She would have nothing to say to you, and you went away out of humor and out of heart. END
BEGIN NOW Stuff and rubbish! END
BEGIN NOW She wanted you to go because she was expecting _me_! END
BEGIN NOW Now do you understand? END
BEGIN NOW We were to complete the arrangements for taking some chambers for you, a jewel of a place, you are to move into it in three days' time. END
BEGIN NOW Don't split upon me. END
BEGIN NOW She wants it to be a surprise; but I couldn't bear to keep the secret from you. END
BEGIN NOW You will be in the Rue d'Artois, only a step or two from the Rue Saint-Lazare, and you are to be housed like a prince! END
BEGIN NOW Any one might have thought we were furnishing the house for a bride. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW we have done a lot of things in the last month, and you knew nothing about it. END
BEGIN NOW My attorney has appeared on the scene, and my daughter is to have thirty-six thousand francs a year, the interest on her money, and I shall insist on having her eight hundred thousand invested in sound securities, landed property that won't run away. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene was dumb. END
BEGIN NOW He folded his arms and paced up and down in his cheerless, untidy room. END
BEGIN NOW Father Goriot waited till the student's back was turned, and seized the opportunity to go to the chimney-piece and set upon it a little red morocco case with Rastignac's arms stamped in gold on the leather. END
BEGIN NOW My dear boy, said the kind soul, I have been up to the eyes in this business. END
BEGIN NOW You see, there was plenty of selfishness on my part; I have an interested motive in helping you to change lodgings. END
BEGIN NOW You will not refuse me if I ask you something; will you, eh? END
BEGIN NOW What is it? END
BEGIN NOW There is a room on the fifth floor, up above your rooms, that is to let along with them; that is where I am going to live, isn't that so? END
BEGIN NOW I am getting old: I am too far from my girls. END
BEGIN NOW I shall not be in the way, but I shall be there, that is all. END
BEGIN NOW You will come and talk to me about her every evening. END
BEGIN NOW It will not put you about, will it? END
BEGIN NOW I shall have gone to bed before you come in, but I shall hear you come up, and I shall say to myself, 'He has just seen my little Delphine. END
BEGIN NOW He has been to a dance with her, and she is happy, thanks to him.' END
BEGIN NOW If I were ill, it would do my heart good to hear you moving about below, to know when you leave the house and when you come in. END
BEGIN NOW It is only a step to the Champs-Elysees, where they go every day, so I shall be sure of seeing them, whereas now I am sometimes too late. END
BEGIN NOW And then&mdash;perhaps she may come to see you! END
BEGIN NOW I shall hear her, I shall see her in her soft quilted pelisse tripping about as daintily as a kitten. END
BEGIN NOW In this one month she has become my little girl again, so light-hearted and gay. END
BEGIN NOW Her soul is recovering, and her happiness is owing to you! END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW I would do impossibilities for you. END
BEGIN NOW Only just now she said to me, 'I am very happy, papa!' END
BEGIN NOW When they say 'father' stiffly, it sends a chill through me; but when they call me 'papa,' it brings all the old memories back. END
BEGIN NOW I feel most their father then; I even believe that they belong to me, and to no one else. END
BEGIN NOW The good man wiped his eyes, he was crying. END
BEGIN NOW It is a long while since I have heard them talk like that, a long, long time since she took my arm as she did to-day. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, indeed, it must be quite ten years since I walked side by side with one of my girls. END
BEGIN NOW How pleasant it was to keep step with her, to feel the touch of her gown, the warmth of her arm! END
BEGIN NOW Well, I took Delphine everywhere this morning; I went shopping with her, and I brought her home again. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW you must let me live near you. END
BEGIN NOW You may want some one to do you a service some of these days, and I shall be on the spot to do it. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW if only that great dolt of an Alsatian would die, if his gout would have the sense to attack his stomach, how happy my poor child would be! END
BEGIN NOW You would be my son-in-law; you would be her husband in the eyes of the world. END
BEGIN NOW Bah! END
BEGIN NOW she has known no happiness, that excuses everything. END
BEGIN NOW Our Father in heaven is surely on the side of fathers on earth who love their children. END
BEGIN NOW How fond of you she is! END
BEGIN NOW he said, raising his head after a pause. END
BEGIN NOW All the time we were going about together she chatted away about you. END
BEGIN NOW 'He is so nice-looking, papa; isn't he? END
BEGIN NOW He is kind-hearted! END
BEGIN NOW Does he talk to you about me?' END
BEGIN NOW Pshaw! END
BEGIN NOW she said enough about you to fill whole volumes; between the Rue d'Artois and the Passage des Panoramas she poured her heart out into mine. END
BEGIN NOW I did not feel old once during that delightful morning; I felt as light as a feather. END
BEGIN NOW I told her how you had given the banknote to me; it moved my darling to tears. END
BEGIN NOW But what can this be on your chimney-piece? END
BEGIN NOW said Father Goriot at last. END
BEGIN NOW Rastignac had showed no sign, and he was dying of impatience. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene stared at his neighbor in dumb and dazed bewilderment. END
BEGIN NOW He thought of Vautrin, of that duel to be fought to-morrow morning, and of this realization of his dearest hopes, and the violent contrast between the two sets of ideas gave him all the sensations of nightmare. END
BEGIN NOW He went to the chimney-piece, saw the little square case, opened it, and found a watch of Breguet's make wrapped in paper, on which these words were written: I want you to think of me every hour, _because_... DELPHINE. END
BEGIN NOW That last word doubtless contained an allusion to some scene that had taken place between them. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene felt touched. END
BEGIN NOW Inside the gold watch-case his arms had been wrought in enamel. END
BEGIN NOW The chain, the key, the workmanship and design of the trinket were all such as he had imagined, for he had long coveted such a possession. END
BEGIN NOW Father Goriot was radiant. END
BEGIN NOW Of course he had promised to tell his daughter every little detail of the scene and of the effect produced upon Eugene by her present; he shared in the pleasure and excitement of the young people, and seemed to be not the least happy of the three. END
BEGIN NOW He loved Rastignac already for his own as well as for his daughter's sake. END
BEGIN NOW You must go and see her; she is expecting you this evening. END
BEGIN NOW That great lout of an Alsatian is going to have supper with his opera-dancer. END
BEGIN NOW Aha! END
BEGIN NOW he looked very foolish when my attorney let him know where he was. END
BEGIN NOW He says he idolizes my daughter, does he? END
BEGIN NOW He had better let her alone, or I will kill him. END
BEGIN NOW To think that my Delphine is his &mdash;he heaved a sigh&mdash; it is enough to make me murder him, but it would not be manslaughter to kill that animal; he is a pig with a calf's brains.&mdash;You will take me with you, will you not? END
BEGIN NOW Yes, dear Father Goriot; you know very well how fond I am of you&mdash;- Yes, I do know very well. END
BEGIN NOW You are not ashamed of me, are you? END
BEGIN NOW Not you! END
BEGIN NOW Let me embrace you, and he flung his arms around the student's neck. END
BEGIN NOW You will make her very happy; promise me that you will! END
BEGIN NOW You will go to her this evening, will you not? END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW yes. END
BEGIN NOW I must go out; I have some urgent business on hand. END
BEGIN NOW Can I be of any use? END
BEGIN NOW My word, yes! END
BEGIN NOW Will you go to old Taillefer's while I go to de Nucingen? END
BEGIN NOW Ask him to make an appointment with me some time this evening; it is a matter of life and death. END
BEGIN NOW Really, young man! END
BEGIN NOW cried Father Goriot, with a change of countenance; are you really paying court to his daughter, as those simpletons were saying down below?... END
BEGIN NOW _Tonnerre de dieu!_ you have no notion what a tap _a la Goriot_ is like, and if you are playing a double game, I shall put a stop to it by one blow of the fist... Oh! END
BEGIN NOW the thing is impossible! END
BEGIN NOW I swear to you that I love but one woman in the world, said the student. END
BEGIN NOW I only knew it a moment ago. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW what happiness! END
BEGIN NOW cried Goriot. END
BEGIN NOW But young Taillefer has been called out; the duel comes off to-morrow morning, and I have heard it said that he may lose his life in it. END
BEGIN NOW But what business is it of yours? END
BEGIN NOW said Goriot. END
BEGIN NOW Why, I ought to tell him so, that he may prevent his son from putting in an appearance&mdash;- Just at that moment Vautrin's voice broke in upon them; he was standing at the threshold of his door and singing: Oh! END
BEGIN NOW Richard, oh my king! END
BEGIN NOW All the world abandons thee! END
BEGIN NOW Broum! END
BEGIN NOW broum! END
BEGIN NOW broum! END
BEGIN NOW broum! END
BEGIN NOW broum! END
BEGIN NOW The same old story everywhere, A roving heart and a... tra la la. END
BEGIN NOW Gentlemen! END
BEGIN NOW shouted Christophe, the soup is ready, and every one is waiting for you. END
BEGIN NOW Here, Vautrin called down to him, come and take a bottle of my Bordeaux. END
BEGIN NOW Do you think your watch is pretty? END
BEGIN NOW asked Goriot. END
BEGIN NOW She has good taste, hasn't she? END
BEGIN NOW Eh? END
BEGIN NOW Vautrin, Father Goriot, and Rastignac came downstairs in company, and, all three of them being late, were obliged to sit together. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene was as distant as possible in his manner to Vautrin during dinner; but the other, so charming in Vauquer's opinion, had never been so witty. END
BEGIN NOW His lively sallies and sparkling talk put the whole table in good humor. END
BEGIN NOW His assurance and coolness filled Eugene with consternation. END
BEGIN NOW Why, what has come to you to-day? END
BEGIN NOW inquired Vauquer. END
BEGIN NOW You are as merry as a skylark. END
BEGIN NOW I am always in spirits after I have made a good bargain. END
BEGIN NOW Bargain? END
BEGIN NOW said Eugene. END
BEGIN NOW Well, yes, bargain. END
BEGIN NOW I have just delivered a lot of goods, and I shall be paid a handsome commission on them&mdash;Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau, he went on, seeing that the elderly spinster was scrutinizing him intently, have you any objection to some feature in my face, that you are making those lynx eyes at me? END
BEGIN NOW Just let me know, and I will have it changed to oblige you... We shall not fall out about it, Poiret, I dare say? END
BEGIN NOW he added, winking at the superannuated clerk. END
BEGIN NOW Bless my soul, you ought to stand as model for a burlesque Hercules, said the young painter. END
BEGIN NOW I will, upon my word! END
BEGIN NOW if Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau will consent to sit as the Venus of Pere-Lachaise, replied Vautrin. END
BEGIN NOW There's Poiret, suggested Bianchon. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW Poiret shall pose as Poiret. END
BEGIN NOW He can be a garden god! END
BEGIN NOW cried Vautrin; his name means a pear&mdash;- A sleepy pear! END
BEGIN NOW Bianchon put in. END
BEGIN NOW You will come in between the pear and the cheese. END
BEGIN NOW What stuff are you all talking! END
BEGIN NOW said Vauquer; you would do better to treat us to your Bordeaux; I see a glimpse of a bottle there. END
BEGIN NOW It would keep us all in a good humor, and it is good for the stomach besides. END
BEGIN NOW Gentlemen, said Vautrin, the Lady President calls us to order. END
BEGIN NOW Couture and Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Victorine will take your jokes in good part, but respect the innocence of the aged Goriot. END
BEGIN NOW I propose a glass or two of Bordeauxrama, rendered twice illustrious by the name of Laffite, no political allusions intended.&mdash;Come, you Turk! END
BEGIN NOW he added, looking at Christophe, who did not offer to stir. END
BEGIN NOW Christophe! END
BEGIN NOW Here! END
BEGIN NOW What, you don't answer to your own name? END
BEGIN NOW Bring us some liquor, Turk! END
BEGIN NOW Here it is, sir, said Christophe, holding out the bottle. END
BEGIN NOW Vautrin filled Eugene's glass and Goriot's likewise, then he deliberately poured out a few drops into his own glass, and sipped it while his two neighbors drank their wine. END
BEGIN NOW All at once he made a grimace. END
BEGIN NOW Corked! END
BEGIN NOW he cried. END
BEGIN NOW The devil! END
BEGIN NOW You can drink the rest of this, Christophe, and go and find another bottle; take from the right-hand side, you know. END
BEGIN NOW There are sixteen of us; take down eight bottles. END
BEGIN NOW If you are going to stand treat, said the painter, I will pay for a hundred chestnuts. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW oh! END
BEGIN NOW Booououh! END
BEGIN NOW Prrr! END
BEGIN NOW These exclamations came from all parts of the table like squibs from a set firework. END
BEGIN NOW Come, now, Mama Vauquer, a couple of bottles of champagne, called Vautrin. END
BEGIN NOW _Quien!_ just like you! END
BEGIN NOW Why not ask for the whole house at once. END
BEGIN NOW A couple of bottles of champagne; that means twelve francs! END
BEGIN NOW I shall never see the money back again, I know! END
BEGIN NOW But if M. Eugene has a mind to pay for it, I have some currant cordial. END
BEGIN NOW That currant cordial of hers is as bad as a black draught, muttered the medical student. END
BEGIN NOW Shut up, Bianchon, exclaimed Rastignac; the very mention of black draught makes me feel&mdash;-. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, champagne, by all means; I will pay for it, he added. END
BEGIN NOW Sylvie, called Vauquer, bring in some biscuits, and the little cakes. END
BEGIN NOW Those little cakes are mouldy graybeards, said Vautrin. END
BEGIN NOW But trot out the biscuits. END
BEGIN NOW The Bordeaux wine circulated; the dinner table became a livelier scene than ever, and the fun grew fast and furious. END
BEGIN NOW Imitations of the cries of various animals mingled with the loud laughter; the Museum official having taken it into his head to mimic a cat-call rather like the caterwauling of the animal in question, eight voices simultaneously struck up with the following variations: Scissors to grind! END
BEGIN NOW Chick-weeds for singing bir-ds! END
BEGIN NOW Brandy-snaps, ladies! END
BEGIN NOW China to mend! END
BEGIN NOW Boat ahoy! END
BEGIN NOW Sticks to beat your wives or your clothes! END
BEGIN NOW Old clo'! END
BEGIN NOW Cherries all ripe! END
BEGIN NOW But the palm was awarded to Bianchon for the nasal accent with which he rendered the cry of Umbrellas to me-end! END
BEGIN NOW A few seconds later, and there was a head-splitting racket in the room, a storm of tomfoolery, a sort of cats' concert, with Vautrin as conductor of the orchestra, the latter keeping an eye the while on Eugene and Father Goriot. END
BEGIN NOW The wine seemed to have gone to their heads already. END
BEGIN NOW They leaned back in their chairs, looking at the general confusion with an air of gravity, and drank but little; both of them were absorbed in the thought of what lay before them to do that evening, and yet neither of them felt able to rise and go. END
BEGIN NOW Vautrin gave a side glance at them from time to time, and watched the change that came over their faces, choosing the moment when their eyes drooped and seemed about to close, to bend over Rastignac and to say in his ear:&mdash; My little lad, you are not quite shrewd enough to outwit Papa Vautrin yet, and he is too fond of you to let you make a mess of your affairs. END
BEGIN NOW When I have made up my mind to do a thing, no one short of Providence can put me off. END
BEGIN NOW Aha! END
BEGIN NOW we were for going round to warn old Taillefer, telling tales out of school! END
BEGIN NOW The oven is hot, the dough is kneaded, the bread is ready for the oven; to-morrow we will eat it up and whisk away the crumbs; and we are not going to spoil the baking?\... No, no, it is all as good as done! END
BEGIN NOW We may suffer from a few conscientious scruples, but they will be digested along with the bread. END
BEGIN NOW While we are having our forty winks, Colonel Count Franchessini will clear the way to Michel Taillefer's inheritance with the point of his sword. END
BEGIN NOW Victorine will come in for her brother's money, a snug fifteen thousand francs a year. END
BEGIN NOW I have made inquiries already, and I know that her late mother's property amounts to more than three hundred thousand&mdash;- Eugene heard all this, and could not answer a word; his tongue seemed to be glued to the roof of his mouth, an irresistible drowsiness was creeping over him. END
BEGIN NOW He still saw the table and the faces round it, but it was through a bright mist. END
BEGIN NOW Soon the noise began to subside, one by one the boarders went. END
BEGIN NOW At last, when their numbers had so dwindled that the party consisted of Vauquer, Couture, Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Victorine, Vautrin, and Father Goriot, Rastignac watched as though in a dream how Vauquer busied herself by collecting the bottles, and drained the remainder of the wine out of each to fill others. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW how uproarious they are! END
BEGIN NOW what a thing it is to be young! END
BEGIN NOW said the widow. END
BEGIN NOW These were the last words that Eugene heard and understood. END
BEGIN NOW There is no one like M. Vautrin for a bit of fun like this, said Sylvie. END
BEGIN NOW There, just hark at Christophe, he is snoring like a top. END
BEGIN NOW Good-bye, mamma, said Vautrin; I am going to a theatre on the boulevard to see M. Marty in _Le Mont Sauvage_, a fine play taken from _Le Solitaire_.... END
BEGIN NOW If you like, I will take you and these two ladies&mdash;- Thank you; I must decline, said Couture. END
BEGIN NOW What! END
BEGIN NOW my good lady! END
BEGIN NOW cried Vauquer, decline to see a play founded on the _Le Solitaire_, a work by Atala de Chateaubriand? END
BEGIN NOW We were so fond of that book that we cried over it like Magdalens under the _line-trees_ last summer, and then it is an improving work that might edify your young lady. END
BEGIN NOW We are forbidden to go to the play, answered Victorine. END
BEGIN NOW Just look, those two yonder have dropped off where they sit, said Vautrin, shaking the heads of the two sleepers in a comical way. END
BEGIN NOW He altered the sleeping student's position, settled his head more comfortably on the back of his chair, kissed him warmly on the forehead, and began to sing: Sleep, little darlings; I watch while you slumber. END
BEGIN NOW I am afraid he may be ill, said Victorine. END
BEGIN NOW Then stop and take care of him, returned Vautrin. END
BEGIN NOW 'Tis your duty as a meek and obedient wife, he whispered in her ear. END
BEGIN NOW The young fellow worships you, and you will be his little wife&mdash;there's your fortune for you. END
BEGIN NOW In short, he added aloud, they lived happily ever afterwards, were much looked up to in all the countryside, and had a numerous family. END
BEGIN NOW That is how all the romances end.&mdash;Now, mamma, he went on, as he turned to Madame Vauquer and put his arm round her waist, put on your bonnet, your best flowered silk, and the countess' scarf, while I go out and call a cab&mdash;all my own self. END
BEGIN NOW And he started out, singing as he went: Oh! END
BEGIN NOW sun! END
BEGIN NOW divine sun! END
BEGIN NOW Ripening the pumpkins every one. END
BEGIN NOW My goodness! END
BEGIN NOW Well, I'm sure! END
BEGIN NOW Couture, I could live happily in a garret with a man like that.&mdash;There, now! END
BEGIN NOW she added, looking round for the old vermicelli maker, there is that Father Goriot half seas over. END
BEGIN NOW _He_ never thought of taking me anywhere, the old skinflint. END
BEGIN NOW But he will measure his length somewhere. END
BEGIN NOW My word! END
BEGIN NOW it is disgraceful to lose his senses like that, at his age! END
BEGIN NOW You will be telling me that he couldn't lose what he hadn't got&mdash;Sylvie, just take him up to his room! END
BEGIN NOW Sylvie took him by the arm, supported him upstairs, and flung him just as he was, like a package, across the bed. END
BEGIN NOW Poor young fellow! END
BEGIN NOW said Couture, putting back Eugene's hair that had fallen over his eyes; he is like a young girl, he does not know what dissipation is. END
BEGIN NOW Well, I can tell you this, I know, said Vauquer, I have taken lodgers these thirty years, and a good many have passed through my hands, as the saying is, but I have never seen a nicer nor a more aristocratic looking young man than M. Eugene. END
BEGIN NOW How handsome he looks sleeping! END
BEGIN NOW Just let his head rest on your shoulder, Couture. END
BEGIN NOW Pshaw! END
BEGIN NOW he falls over towards Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Victorine. END
BEGIN NOW There's a special providence for young things. END
BEGIN NOW A little more, and he would have broken his head against the knob of the chair. END
BEGIN NOW They'd make a pretty pair those two would! END
BEGIN NOW Hush, my good neighbor, cried Couture, you are saying such things&mdash;- Pooh! END
BEGIN NOW put in Vauquer, he does not hear.&mdash;Here, Sylvie! END
BEGIN NOW come and help me to dress. END
BEGIN NOW I shall put on my best stays. END
BEGIN NOW What! END
BEGIN NOW your best stays just after dinner, madame? END
BEGIN NOW said Sylvie. END
BEGIN NOW No, you can get some one else to lace you. END
BEGIN NOW I am not going to be your murderer. END
BEGIN NOW It's a rash thing to do, and might cost you your life. END
BEGIN NOW I don't care, I must do honor to M. Vautrin. END
BEGIN NOW Are you so fond of your heirs as all that? END
BEGIN NOW Come, Sylvie, don't argue, said the widow, as she left the room. END
BEGIN NOW At her age, too! END
BEGIN NOW said the cook to Victorine, pointing to her mistress as she spoke. END
BEGIN NOW Couture and her ward were left in the dining-room, and Eugene slept on Victorine's shoulder. END
BEGIN NOW The sound of Christophe's snoring echoed through the silent house; Eugene's quiet breathing seemed all the quieter by force of contrast, he was sleeping as peacefully as a child. END
BEGIN NOW Victorine was very happy; she was free to perform one of those acts of charity which form an innocent outlet for all the overflowing sentiments of a woman's nature; he was so close to her that she could feel the throbbing of his heart; there was a look of almost maternal protection and conscious pride in Victorine's face. END
BEGIN NOW Among the countless thoughts that crowded up in her young innocent heart, there was a wild flutter of joy at this close contact. END
BEGIN NOW Poor, dear child! END
BEGIN NOW said Couture, squeezing her hand. END
BEGIN NOW The old lady looked at the girl. END
BEGIN NOW Victorine's innocent, pathetic face, so radiant with the new happiness that had befallen her, called to mind some naive work of mediaeval art, when the painter neglected the accessories, reserving all the magic of his brush for the quiet, austere outlines and ivory tints of the face, which seems to have caught something of the golden glory of heaven. END
BEGIN NOW After all, he only took two glasses, mamma, said Victorine, passing her fingers through Eugene's hair. END
BEGIN NOW Indeed, if he had been a dissipated young man, child, he would have carried his wine like the rest of them. END
BEGIN NOW His drowsiness does him credit. END
BEGIN NOW There was a sound of wheels outside in the street. END
BEGIN NOW There is M. Vautrin, mamma, said the girl. END
BEGIN NOW Just take M. Eugene. END
BEGIN NOW I would rather not have that man see me like this; there are some ways of looking at you that seem to sully your soul and make you feel as though you had nothing on. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, no, you are wrong! END
BEGIN NOW said Couture. END
BEGIN NOW M. Vautrin is a worthy man; he reminds me a little of my late husband, poor dear M. Couture, rough but kind-hearted; his bark is worse than his bite. END
BEGIN NOW Vautrin came in while she was speaking; he did not make a sound, but looked for a while at the picture of the two young faces&mdash;the lamplight falling full upon them seemed to caress them. END
BEGIN NOW Well, he remarked, folding his arms, here is a picture! END
BEGIN NOW It would have suggested some pleasing pages to Bernardin de Saint-Pierre (good soul), who wrote _Paul et Virginie_. END
BEGIN NOW Youth is very charming, Couture!&mdash;Sleep on, poor boy, he added, looking at Eugene, luck sometimes comes while you are sleeping.&mdash;There is something touching and attractive to me about this young man, madame, he continued; I know that his nature is in harmony with his face. END
BEGIN NOW Just look, the head of a cherub on an angel's shoulder! END
BEGIN NOW He deserves to be loved. END
BEGIN NOW If I were a woman, I would die (no&mdash;not such a fool), I would live for him. END
BEGIN NOW He bent lower and spoke in the widow's ear. END
BEGIN NOW When I see those two together, madame, I cannot help thinking that Providence meant them for each other; He works by secret ways, and tries the reins and the heart, he said in a loud voice. END
BEGIN NOW And when I see you, my children, thus united by a like purity and by all human affections, I say to myself that it is quite impossible that the future should separate you. END
BEGIN NOW God is just. END
BEGIN NOW &mdash;He turned to Victorine. END
BEGIN NOW It seems to me, he said, that I have seen the line of success in your hand. END
BEGIN NOW Let me look at it, Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Victorine; I am well up in palmistry, and I have told fortunes many a time. END
BEGIN NOW Come, now, don't be frightened. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW what do I see? END
BEGIN NOW Upon my word, you will be one of the richest heiresses in Paris before very long. END
BEGIN NOW You will heap riches on the man who loves you. END
BEGIN NOW Your father will want you to go and live with him. END
BEGIN NOW You will marry a young and handsome man with a title, and he will idolize you. END
BEGIN NOW The heavy footsteps of the coquettish widow, who was coming down the stairs, interrupted Vautrin's fortune-telling. END
BEGIN NOW Here is Mamma Vauquerre, fair as a starr-r-r, dressed within an inch of her life.&mdash;Aren't we a trifle pinched for room? END
BEGIN NOW he inquired, with his arm round the lady; we are screwed up very tightly about the bust, mamma! END
BEGIN NOW If we are much agitated, there may be an explosion; but I will pick up the fragments with all the care of an antiquary. END
BEGIN NOW There is a man who can talk the language of French gallantry! END
BEGIN NOW said the widow, bending to speak in Couture's ear. END
BEGIN NOW Good-bye, little ones! END
BEGIN NOW said Vautrin, turning to Eugene and Victorine. END
BEGIN NOW Bless you both! END
BEGIN NOW and he laid a hand on either head. END
BEGIN NOW Take my word for it, young lady, an honest man's prayers are worth something; they should bring you happiness, for God hears them. END
BEGIN NOW Good-bye, dear, said Vauquer to her lodger. END
BEGIN NOW Do you think that M. Vautrin means to run away with me? END
BEGIN NOW she added, lowering her voice. END
BEGIN NOW Lack-a-day! END
BEGIN NOW said the widow. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW mamma dear, suppose it should really happen as that kind M. Vautrin said! END
BEGIN NOW said Victorine with a sigh as she looked at her hands. END
BEGIN NOW The two women were alone together. END
BEGIN NOW Why, it wouldn't take much to bring it to pass, said the elderly lady; just a fall from his horse, and your monster of a brother&mdash;- Oh! END
BEGIN NOW mamma. END
BEGIN NOW Good Lord! END
BEGIN NOW Well, perhaps it is a sin to wish bad luck to an enemy, the widow remarked. END
BEGIN NOW I will do penance for it. END
BEGIN NOW Still, I would strew flowers on his grave with the greatest pleasure, and that is the truth. END
BEGIN NOW Black-hearted, that he is! END
BEGIN NOW The coward couldn't speak up for his own mother, and cheats you out of your share by deceit and trickery. END
BEGIN NOW My cousin had a pretty fortune of her own, but unluckily for you, nothing was said in the marriage-contract about anything that she might come in for. END
BEGIN NOW It would be very hard if my fortune is to cost some one else his life, said Victorine. END
BEGIN NOW If I cannot be happy unless my brother is to be taken out of the world, I would rather stay here all my life. END
BEGIN NOW _Mon Dieu!_ it is just as that good M. Vautrin says, and he is full of piety, you see, Couture remarked. END
BEGIN NOW I am very glad to find that he is not an unbeliever like the rest of them that talk of the Almighty with less respect than they do of the Devil. END
BEGIN NOW Well, as he was saying, who can know the ways by which it may please Providence to lead us? END
BEGIN NOW With Sylvie's help the two women at last succeeded in getting Eugene up to his room; they laid him on the bed, and the cook unfastened his clothes to make him more comfortable. END
BEGIN NOW Before they left the room, Victorine snatched an opportunity when her guardian's back was turned, and pressed a kiss on Eugene's forehead, feeling all the joy that this stolen pleasure could give her. END
BEGIN NOW Then she looked round the room, and gathering up, as it were, into one single thought all the untold bliss of that day, she made a picture of her memories, and dwelt upon it until she slept, the happiest creature in Paris. END
BEGIN NOW That evening's merry-making, in the course of which Vautrin had given the drugged wine to Eugene and Father Goriot, was his own ruin. END
BEGIN NOW Bianchon, flustered with wine, forgot to open the subject of Trompe-la-Mort with Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau. END
BEGIN NOW The mere mention of the name would have set Vautrin on his guard; for Vautrin, or, to give him his real name, Jacques Collin, was in fact the notorious escaped convict. END
BEGIN NOW But it was the joke about the Venus of Pere-Lachaise that finally decided his fate. END
BEGIN NOW Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau had very nearly made up her mind to warn the convict and to throw herself on his generosity, with the idea of making a better bargain for herself by helping him to escape that night; but as it was, she went out escorted by Poiret in search of the famous chief of detectives in the Petite Rue Saint-Anne, still thinking that it was the district superintendent&mdash;one Gondureau&mdash;with whom she had to do. END
BEGIN NOW The head of the department received his visitors courteously. END
BEGIN NOW There was a little talk, and the details were definitely arranged. END
BEGIN NOW Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau asked for the draught that she was to administer in order to set about her investigation. END
BEGIN NOW But the great man's evident satisfaction set Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau thinking; and she began to see that this business involved something more than the mere capture of a runaway convict. END
BEGIN NOW She racked her brains while he looked in a drawer in his desk for the little phial, and it dawned upon her that in consequence of treacherous revelations made by the prisoners the police were hoping to lay their hands on a considerable sum of money. END
BEGIN NOW But on hinting her suspicions to the old fox of the Petite Rue Saint-Anne, that officer began to smile, and tried to put her off the scent. END
BEGIN NOW A delusion, he said. END
BEGIN NOW Collin's _sorbonne_ is the most dangerous that has yet been found among the dangerous classes. END
BEGIN NOW That is all, and the rascals are quite aware of it. END
BEGIN NOW They rally round him; he is the backbone of the federation, its Bonaparte, in short; he is very popular with them all. END
BEGIN NOW The rogue will never leave his _chump_ in the Place de Greve. END
BEGIN NOW As Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau seemed mystified, Gondureau explained the two slang words for her benefit. END
BEGIN NOW _Sorbonne_ and _chump_ are two forcible expressions borrowed from thieves' Latin, thieves, of all people, being compelled to consider the human head in its two aspects. END
BEGIN NOW A sorbonne is the head of a living man, his faculty of thinking&mdash;his council; a chump is a contemptuous epithet that implies how little a human head is worth after the axe has done its work. END
BEGIN NOW Collin is playing us off, he continued. END
BEGIN NOW When we come across a man like a bar of steel tempered in the English fashion, there is always one resource left&mdash;we can kill him if he takes it into his head to make the least resistance. END
BEGIN NOW We are reckoning on several methods of killing Collin to-morrow morning. END
BEGIN NOW It saves a trial, and society is rid of him without all the expense of guarding and feeding him. END
BEGIN NOW What with getting up the case, summoning witnesses, paying their expenses, and carrying out the sentence, it costs a lot to go through all the proper formalities before you can get quit of one of these good-for-nothings, over and above the three thousand francs that you are going to have. END
BEGIN NOW There is a saving in time as well. END
BEGIN NOW One good thrust of the bayonet into Trompe-la-Mort's paunch will prevent scores of crimes, and save fifty scoundrels from following his example; they will be very careful to keep themselves out of the police courts. END
BEGIN NOW That is doing the work of the police thoroughly, and true philanthropists will tell you that it is better to prevent crime than to punish it. END
BEGIN NOW And you do a service to our country, said Poiret. END
BEGIN NOW Really, you are talking in a very sensible manner tonight, that you are, said the head of the department. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, of course, we are serving our country, and we are very hardly used too. END
BEGIN NOW We do society very great services that are not recognized. END
BEGIN NOW In fact, a superior man must rise above vulgar prejudices, and a Christian must resign himself to the mishaps that doing right entails, when right is done in an out-of-the-way style. END
BEGIN NOW Paris is Paris, you see! END
BEGIN NOW That is the explanation of my life.&mdash;I have the honor to wish you a good-evening, mademoiselle. END
BEGIN NOW I shall bring my men to the Jardin du Roi in the morning. END
BEGIN NOW Send Christophe to the Rue du Buffon, tell him to ask for M. Gondureau in the house where you saw me before.&mdash;Your servant, sir. END
BEGIN NOW If you should ever have anything stolen from you, come to me, and I will do my best to get it back for you. END
BEGIN NOW Well, now, Poiret remarked to Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau, there are idiots who are scared out of their wits by the word police. END
BEGIN NOW That was a very pleasant-spoken gentleman, and what he wants you to do is as easy as saying 'Good-day.' END
BEGIN NOW The next day was destined to be one of the most extraordinary in the annals of the Maison Vauquer. END
BEGIN NOW Hitherto the most startling occurrence in its tranquil existence had been the portentous, meteor-like apparition of the sham Comtesse de l'Ambermesnil. END
BEGIN NOW But the catastrophes of this great day were to cast all previous events into the shade, and supply an inexhaustible topic of conversation for Vauquer and her boarders so long as she lived. END
BEGIN NOW In the first place, Goriot and Eugene de Rastignac both slept till close upon eleven o'clock. END
BEGIN NOW Vauquer, who came home about midnight from the Gaite, lay a-bed till half-past ten. END
BEGIN NOW Christophe, after a prolonged slumber (he had finished Vautrin's first bottle of wine), was behindhand with his work, but Poiret and Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau uttered no complaint, though breakfast was delayed. END
BEGIN NOW As for Victorine and Couture, they also lay late. END
BEGIN NOW Vautrin went out before eight o'clock, and only came back just as breakfast was ready. END
BEGIN NOW Nobody protested, therefore, when Sylvie and Christophe went up at a quarter past eleven, knocked at all the doors, and announced that breakfast was waiting. END
BEGIN NOW While Sylvie and the man were upstairs, Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau, who came down first, poured the contents of the phial into the silver cup belonging to Vautrin&mdash;it was standing with the others in the bain-marie that kept the cream hot for the morning coffee. END
BEGIN NOW The spinster had reckoned on this custom of the house to do her stroke of business. END
BEGIN NOW The seven lodgers were at last collected together, not without some difficulty. END
BEGIN NOW Just as Eugene came downstairs, stretching himself and yawning, a commissionaire handed him a letter from de Nucingen. END
BEGIN NOW It ran thus:&mdash; I feel neither false vanity nor anger where you are concerned, my friend. END
BEGIN NOW Till two o'clock this morning I waited for you. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, that waiting for one whom you love! END
BEGIN NOW No one that had passed through that torture could inflict it on another. END
BEGIN NOW I know now that you have never loved before. END
BEGIN NOW What can have happened? END
BEGIN NOW Anxiety has taken hold of me. END
BEGIN NOW I would have come myself to find out what had happened, if I had not feared to betray the secrets of my heart. END
BEGIN NOW How can I walk out or drive out at this time of day? END
BEGIN NOW Would it not be ruin? END
BEGIN NOW I have felt to the full how wretched it is to be a woman. END
BEGIN NOW Send a word to reassure me, and explain how it is that you have not come after what my father told you. END
BEGIN NOW I shall be angry, but I will forgive you. END
BEGIN NOW One word, for pity's sake. END
BEGIN NOW You will come to me soon, will you not? END
BEGIN NOW If you are busy, a line will be enough. END
BEGIN NOW Say, 'I will hasten to you,' or else, 'I am ill.' But if you were ill my father would have come to tell me so. END
BEGIN NOW What can have happened?... END
BEGIN NOW Yes, indeed, what has happened? END
BEGIN NOW exclaimed Eugene, and, hurrying down to the dining-room, he crumpled up the letter without reading any more. END
BEGIN NOW What time is it? END
BEGIN NOW Half-past eleven, said Vautrin, dropping a lump of sugar into his coffee. END
BEGIN NOW The escaped convict cast a glance at Eugene, a cold and fascinating glance; men gifted with this magnetic power can quell furious lunatics in a madhouse by such a glance, it is said. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene shook in every limb. END
BEGIN NOW There was the sound of wheels in the street, and in another moment a man with a scared face rushed into the room. END
BEGIN NOW It was one of M. Taillefer's servants; Couture recognized the livery at once. END
BEGIN NOW Mademoiselle, he cried, your father is asking for you&mdash;something terrible has happened! END
BEGIN NOW M. Frederic has had a sword thrust in the forehead in a duel, and the doctors have given him up. END
BEGIN NOW You will scarcely be in time to say good-bye to him! END
BEGIN NOW he is unconscious. END
BEGIN NOW Poor young fellow! END
BEGIN NOW exclaimed Vautrin. END
BEGIN NOW How can people brawl when they have a certain income of thirty thousand livres? END
BEGIN NOW Young people have bad manners, and that is a fact. END
BEGIN NOW Sir! END
BEGIN NOW cried Eugene. END
BEGIN NOW Well, what then, you big baby! END
BEGIN NOW said Vautrin, swallowing down his coffee imperturbably, an operation which Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau watched with such close attention that she had no emotion to spare for the amazing news that had struck the others dumb with amazement. END
BEGIN NOW Are there not duels every morning in Paris? END
BEGIN NOW added Vautrin. END
BEGIN NOW I will go with you, Victorine, said Couture, and the two women hurried away at once without either hats or shawls. END
BEGIN NOW But before she went, Victorine, with her eyes full of tears, gave Eugene a glance that said&mdash; How little I thought that our happiness should cost me tears! END
BEGIN NOW Dear me, you are a prophet, M. Vautrin, said Vauquer. END
BEGIN NOW I am all sorts of things, said Vautrin. END
BEGIN NOW Queer, isn't it? END
BEGIN NOW said Vauquer, stringing together a succession of commonplaces suited to the occasion. END
BEGIN NOW Death takes us off without asking us about it. END
BEGIN NOW The young often go before the old. END
BEGIN NOW It is a lucky thing for us women that we are not liable to fight duels, but we have other complaints that men don't suffer from. END
BEGIN NOW We bear children, and it takes a long time to get over it. END
BEGIN NOW What a windfall for Victorine! END
BEGIN NOW Her father will have to acknowledge her now! END
BEGIN NOW There! END
BEGIN NOW said Vautrin, looking at Eugene, yesterday she had not a penny; this morning she has several millions to her fortune. END
BEGIN NOW I say, M. Eugene! END
BEGIN NOW cried Vauquer, you have landed on your feet! END
BEGIN NOW At this exclamation, Father Goriot looked at the student, and saw the crumpled letter still in his hand. END
BEGIN NOW You have not read it through! END
BEGIN NOW What does this mean? END
BEGIN NOW Are you going to be like the rest of them? END
BEGIN NOW he asked. END
BEGIN NOW Madame, I shall never marry Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Victorine, said Eugene, turning to Vauquer with an expression of terror and loathing that surprised the onlookers at this scene. END
BEGIN NOW Father Goriot caught the student's hand and grasped it warmly. END
BEGIN NOW He could have kissed it. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, ho! END
BEGIN NOW said Vautrin, the Italians have a good proverb&mdash;_Col tempo_. END
BEGIN NOW Is there any answer? END
BEGIN NOW said de Nucingen's messenger, addressing Eugene. END
BEGIN NOW Say that I will come directly. END
BEGIN NOW The man went. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene was in a state of such violent excitement that he could not be prudent. END
BEGIN NOW What is to be done? END
BEGIN NOW he exclaimed aloud. END
BEGIN NOW There are no proofs! END
BEGIN NOW Vautrin began to smile. END
BEGIN NOW Though the drug he had taken was doing its work, the convict was so vigorous that he rose to his feet, gave Rastignac a look, and said in hollow tones, Luck comes to us while we sleep, young man, and fell stiff and stark, as if he were struck dead. END
BEGIN NOW So there is a Divine Justice! END
BEGIN NOW said Eugene. END
BEGIN NOW Well, if ever! END
BEGIN NOW What has come to that poor dear M. Vautrin? END
BEGIN NOW A stroke! END
BEGIN NOW cried Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau. END
BEGIN NOW Here, Sylvie! END
BEGIN NOW girl, run for the doctor, called the widow. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, M. Rastignac, just go for M. Bianchon, and be as quick as you can; Sylvie might not be in time to catch our doctor, M. Grimprel. END
BEGIN NOW Rastignac was glad of an excuse to leave that den of horrors, his hurry for the doctor was nothing but a flight. END
BEGIN NOW Here, Christophe, go round to the chemist's and ask for something that's good for the apoplexy. END
BEGIN NOW Christophe likewise went. END
BEGIN NOW Father Goriot, just help us to get him upstairs. END
BEGIN NOW Vautrin was taken up among them, carried carefully up the narrow staircase, and laid upon his bed. END
BEGIN NOW I can do no good here, so I shall go to see my daughter, said M. Goriot. END
BEGIN NOW Selfish old thing! END
BEGIN NOW cried Vauquer. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, go; I wish you may die like a dog. END
BEGIN NOW Just go and see if you can find some ether, said Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau to Vauquer; the former, with some help from Poiret, had unfastened the sick man's clothes. END
BEGIN NOW Vauquer went down to her room, and left Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau mistress of the situation. END
BEGIN NOW Now! END
BEGIN NOW just pull down his shirt and turn him over, quick! END
BEGIN NOW You might be of some use in sparing my modesty, she said to Poiret, instead of standing there like a stock. END
BEGIN NOW Vautrin was turned over; Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau gave his shoulder a sharp slap, and the two portentous letters appeared, white against the red. END
BEGIN NOW There, you have earned your three thousand francs very easily, exclaimed Poiret, supporting Vautrin while Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau slipped on the shirt again.&mdash; Ouf! END
BEGIN NOW How heavy he is, he added, as he laid the convict down. END
BEGIN NOW Hush! END
BEGIN NOW Suppose there is a strong-box here! END
BEGIN NOW said the old maid briskly; her glances seemed to pierce the walls, she scrutinized every article of the furniture with greedy eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Could we find some excuse for opening that desk? END
BEGIN NOW It mightn't be quite right, responded Poiret to this. END
BEGIN NOW Where is the harm? END
BEGIN NOW It is money stolen from all sorts of people, so it doesn't belong to any one now. END
BEGIN NOW But we haven't time, there is the Vauquer. END
BEGIN NOW Here is the ether, said that lady. END
BEGIN NOW I must say that this is an eventful day. END
BEGIN NOW Lord! END
BEGIN NOW that man can't have had a stroke; he is as white as curds. END
BEGIN NOW White as curds? END
BEGIN NOW echoed Poiret. END
BEGIN NOW And his pulse is steady, said the widow, laying her hand on his breast. END
BEGIN NOW Steady? END
BEGIN NOW said the astonished Poiret. END
BEGIN NOW He is all right. END
BEGIN NOW Do you think so? END
BEGIN NOW asked Poiret. END
BEGIN NOW Lord! END
BEGIN NOW Yes, he looks as if he were sleeping. END
BEGIN NOW Sylvie has gone for a doctor. END
BEGIN NOW I say, Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau, he is sniffing the ether. END
BEGIN NOW Pooh! END
BEGIN NOW it is only a spasm. END
BEGIN NOW His pulse is good. END
BEGIN NOW He is as strong as a Turk. END
BEGIN NOW Just look, mademoiselle, what a fur tippet he has on his chest; that is the sort of man to live till he is a hundred. END
BEGIN NOW His wig holds on tightly, however. END
BEGIN NOW Dear me! END
BEGIN NOW it is glued on, and his own hair is red; that is why he wears a wig. END
BEGIN NOW They say that red-haired people are either the worst or the best. END
BEGIN NOW Is he one of the good ones, I wonder? END
BEGIN NOW Good to hang, said Poiret. END
BEGIN NOW Round a pretty woman's neck, you mean, said Mlle Michonneau, hastily. END
BEGIN NOW Just go away, M. Poiret. END
BEGIN NOW It is a woman's duty to nurse you men when you are ill. END
BEGIN NOW Besides, for all the good you are doing, you may as well take yourself off, she added. END
BEGIN NOW Vauquer and I will take great care of dear M. Vautrin. END
BEGIN NOW Poiret went out on tiptoe without a murmur, like a dog kicked out of the room by his master. END
BEGIN NOW Rastignac had gone out for the sake of physical exertion; he wanted to breathe the air, he felt stifled. END
BEGIN NOW Yesterday evening he had meant to prevent the murder arranged for half-past eight that morning. END
BEGIN NOW What had happened? END
BEGIN NOW What ought he to do now? END
BEGIN NOW He trembled to think that he himself might be implicated. END
BEGIN NOW Vautrin's coolness still further dismayed him. END
BEGIN NOW Yet, how if Vautrin should die without saying a word? END
BEGIN NOW Rastignac asked himself. END
BEGIN NOW He hurried along the alleys of the Luxembourg Gardens as if the hounds of justice were after him, and he already heard the baying of the pack. END
BEGIN NOW Well? END
BEGIN NOW shouted Bianchon, you have seen the _Pilote_? END
BEGIN NOW The _Pilote_ was a Radical sheet, edited by M. Tissot. END
BEGIN NOW It came out several hours later than the morning papers, and was meant for the benefit of country subscribers; for it brought the morning news into provincial districts twenty-four hours sooner than the ordinary local journals. END
BEGIN NOW There is a wonderful history in it, said the house student of the Hopital Cochin. END
BEGIN NOW Young Taillefer called out Count Franchessini, of the Old Guard, and the Count put a couple of inches of steel into his forehead. END
BEGIN NOW And here is little Victorine one of the richest heiresses in Paris! END
BEGIN NOW If we had known that, eh? END
BEGIN NOW What a game of chance death is! END
BEGIN NOW They say Victorine was sweet on you; was there any truth in it? END
BEGIN NOW Shut up, Bianchon; I shall never marry her. END
BEGIN NOW I am in love with a charming woman, and she is in love with me, so&mdash;- You said that as if you were screwing yourself up to be faithful to her. END
BEGIN NOW I should like to see the woman worth the sacrifice of Master Taillefer's money! END
BEGIN NOW Are all the devils of hell at my heels? END
BEGIN NOW cried Rastignac. END
BEGIN NOW What is the matter with you? END
BEGIN NOW Are you mad? END
BEGIN NOW Give us your hand, said Bianchon, and let me feel your pulse. END
BEGIN NOW You are feverish. END
BEGIN NOW Just go to Mother Vauquer's, said Rastignac; that scoundrel Vautrin has dropped down like one dead. END
BEGIN NOW Aha! END
BEGIN NOW said Bianchon, leaving Rastignac to his reflections, you confirm my suspicions, and now I mean to make sure for myself. END
BEGIN NOW The law student's long walk was a memorable one for him. END
BEGIN NOW He made in some sort a survey of his conscience. END
BEGIN NOW After a close scrutiny, after hesitation and self-examination, his honor at any rate came out scatheless from this sharp and terrible ordeal, like a bar of iron tested in the English fashion. END
BEGIN NOW He remembered Father Goriot's confidences of the evening before; he recollected the rooms taken for him in the Rue d'Artois, so that he might be near Delphine; and then he thought of his letter, and read it again and kissed it. END
BEGIN NOW Such a love is my anchor of safety, he said to himself. END
BEGIN NOW How the old man's heart must have been wrung! END
BEGIN NOW He says nothing about all that he has been through; but who could not guess? END
BEGIN NOW Well, then, I will be like a son to him; his life shall be made happy. END
BEGIN NOW If she cares for me, she will often come to spend the day with him. END
BEGIN NOW That grand Comtesse de Restaud is a heartless thing; she would make her father into her hall porter. END
BEGIN NOW Dear Delphine! END
BEGIN NOW she is kinder to the old man; she is worthy to be loved. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW this evening I shall be very happy! END
BEGIN NOW He took out his watch and admired it. END
BEGIN NOW I have had nothing but success! END
BEGIN NOW If two people mean to love each other for ever, they may help each other, and I can take this. END
BEGIN NOW Besides, I shall succeed, and I will pay her a hundredfold. END
BEGIN NOW There is nothing criminal in this _liaison_; nothing that could cause the most austere moralist to frown. END
BEGIN NOW How many respectable people contract similar unions! END
BEGIN NOW We deceive nobody; it is deception that makes a position humiliating. END
BEGIN NOW If you lie, you lower yourself at once. END
BEGIN NOW She and her husband have lived apart for a long while. END
BEGIN NOW Besides, how if I called upon that Alsatian to resign a wife whom he cannot make happy? END
BEGIN NOW Rastignac's battle with himself went on for a long while; and though the scruples of youth inevitably gained the day, an irresistible curiosity led him, about half-past four, to return to the Maison Vauquer through the gathering dusk. END
BEGIN NOW Bianchon had given Vautrin an emetic, reserving the contents of the stomach for chemical analysis at the hospital. END
BEGIN NOW Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau's officious alacrity had still further strengthened his suspicions of her. END
BEGIN NOW Vautrin, moreover, had recovered so quickly that it was impossible not to suspect some plot against the leader of all frolics at the lodging-house. END
BEGIN NOW Vautrin was standing in front of the stove in the dining-room when Rastignac came in. END
BEGIN NOW All the lodgers were assembled sooner than usual by the news of young Taillefer's duel. END
BEGIN NOW They were anxious to hear any detail about the affair, and to talk over the probable change in Victorine's prospects. END
BEGIN NOW Father Goriot alone was absent, but the rest were chatting. END
BEGIN NOW No sooner did Eugene come into the room, than his eyes met the inscrutable gaze of Vautrin. END
BEGIN NOW It was the same look that had read his thoughts before&mdash;the look that had such power to waken evil thoughts in his heart. END
BEGIN NOW He shuddered. END
BEGIN NOW Well, dear boy, said the escaped convict, I am likely to cheat death for a good while yet. END
BEGIN NOW According to these ladies, I have had a stroke that would have felled an ox, and come off with flying colors. END
BEGIN NOW A bull you might say, cried the widow. END
BEGIN NOW You really might be sorry to see me still alive, said Vautrin in Rastignac's ear, thinking that he guessed the student's thoughts. END
BEGIN NOW You must be mighty sure of yourself. END
BEGIN NOW Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau was talking the day before yesterday about a gentleman named _Trompe-la-Mort_, said Bianchon; and, upon my word, that name would do very well for you. END
BEGIN NOW Vautrin seemed thunderstruck. END
BEGIN NOW He turned pale, and staggered back. END
BEGIN NOW He turned his magnetic glance, like a ray of vivid light, on Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau; the old maid shrank and trembled under the influence of that strong will, and collapsed into a chair. END
BEGIN NOW The mask of good-nature had dropped from the convict's face; from the unmistakable ferocity of that sinister look, Poiret felt that the old maid was in danger, and hastily stepped between them. END
BEGIN NOW None of the lodgers understood this scene in the least, they looked on in mute amazement. END
BEGIN NOW There was a pause. END
BEGIN NOW Just then there was a sound of tramping feet outside; there were soldiers there, it seemed, for there was a ring of several rifles on the pavement of the street. END
BEGIN NOW Collin was mechanically looking round the walls for a way of escape, when four men entered by way of the sitting-room. END
BEGIN NOW In the name of the King and the Law! END
BEGIN NOW said an officer, but the words were almost lost in a murmur of astonishment. END
BEGIN NOW Silence fell on the room. END
BEGIN NOW The lodgers made way for three of the men, who had each a hand on a cocked pistol in a side pocket. END
BEGIN NOW Two policemen, who followed the detectives, kept the entrance to the sitting-room, and two more men appeared in the doorway that gave access to the staircase. END
BEGIN NOW A sound of footsteps came from the garden, and again the rifles of several soldiers rang on the cobblestones under the window. END
BEGIN NOW All chance of salvation by flight was cut off for Trompe-la-Mort, to whom all eyes instinctively turned. END
BEGIN NOW The chief walked straight up to him, and commenced operations by giving him a sharp blow on the head, so that the wig fell off, and Collin's face was revealed in all its ugliness. END
BEGIN NOW There was a terrible suggestion of strength mingled with cunning in the short, brick-red crop of hair, the whole head was in harmony with his powerful frame, and at that moment the fires of hell seemed to gleam from his eyes. END
BEGIN NOW In that flash the real Vautrin shone forth, revealed at once before them all; they understood his past, his present, and future, his pitiless doctrines, his actions, the religion of his own good pleasure, the majesty with which his cynicism and contempt for mankind invested him, the physical strength of an organization proof against all trials. END
BEGIN NOW The blood flew to his face, and his eyes glared like the eyes of a wild cat. END
BEGIN NOW He started back with savage energy and a fierce growl that drew exclamations of alarm from the lodgers. END
BEGIN NOW At that leonine start the police caught at their pistols under cover of the general clamor. END
BEGIN NOW Collin saw the gleaming muzzles of the weapons, saw his danger, and instantly gave proof of a power of the highest order. END
BEGIN NOW There was something horrible and majestic in the spectacle of the sudden transformation in his face; he could only be compared to a cauldron full of the steam that can send mountains flying, a terrific force dispelled in a moment by a drop of cold water. END
BEGIN NOW The drop of water that cooled his wrathful fury was a reflection that flashed across his brain like lightning. END
BEGIN NOW He began to smile, and looked down at his wig. END
BEGIN NOW You are not in the politest of humors to-day, he remarked to the chief, and he held out his hands to the policemen with a jerk of his head. END
BEGIN NOW Gentlemen, he said, put on the bracelets or the handcuffs. END
BEGIN NOW I call on those present to witness that I make no resistance. END
BEGIN NOW A murmur of admiration ran through the room at the sudden outpouring like fire and lava flood from this human volcano, and its equally sudden cessation. END
BEGIN NOW There's a sell for you, master crusher, the convict added, looking at the famous director of police. END
BEGIN NOW Come, strip! END
BEGIN NOW said he of the Petite Rue Saint-Anne, contemptuously. END
BEGIN NOW Why? END
BEGIN NOW asked Collin. END
BEGIN NOW There are ladies present; I deny nothing, and surrender. END
BEGIN NOW He paused, and looked round the room like an orator who is about to overwhelm his audience. END
BEGIN NOW Take this down, Daddy Lachapelle, he went on, addressing a little, white-haired old man who had seated himself at the end of the table; and after drawing a printed form from the portfolio, was proceeding to draw up a document. END
BEGIN NOW I acknowledge myself to be Jacques Collin, otherwise known as Trompe-la-Mort, condemned to twenty years' penal servitude, and I have just proved that I have come fairly by my nickname.&mdash;If I had as much as raised my hand, he went on, addressing the other lodgers, those three sneaking wretches yonder would have drawn claret on Mamma Vauquer's domestic hearth. END
BEGIN NOW The rogues have laid their heads together to set a trap for me. END
BEGIN NOW Vauquer felt sick and faint at these words. END
BEGIN NOW Good Lord! END
BEGIN NOW she cried, this does give one a turn; and me at the Gaite with him only last night! END
BEGIN NOW she said to Sylvie. END
BEGIN NOW Summon your philosophy, mamma, Collin resumed. END
BEGIN NOW Is it a misfortune to have sat in my box at the Gaite yesterday evening? END
BEGIN NOW After all, are you better than we are? END
BEGIN NOW The brand upon our shoulders is less shameful than the brand set on your hearts, you flabby members of a society rotten to the core. END
BEGIN NOW Not the best man among you could stand up to me. END
BEGIN NOW His eyes rested upon Rastignac, to whom he spoke with a pleasant smile that seemed strangely at variance with the savage expression in his eyes.&mdash; Our little bargain still holds good, dear boy; you can accept any time you like! END
BEGIN NOW Do you understand? END
BEGIN NOW And he sang: A charming girl is my Fanchette In her simplicity. END
BEGIN NOW Don't you trouble yourself, he went on; I can get in my money. END
BEGIN NOW They are too much afraid of me to swindle me. END
BEGIN NOW The convicts' prison, its language and customs, its sudden sharp transitions from the humorous to the horrible, its appalling grandeur, its triviality and its dark depths, were all revealed in turn by the speaker's discourse; he seemed to be no longer a man, but the type and mouthpiece of a degenerate race, a brutal, supple, clear-headed race of savages. END
BEGIN NOW In one moment Collin became the poet of an inferno, wherein all thoughts and passions that move human nature (save repentance) find a place. END
BEGIN NOW He looked about him like a fallen archangel who is for war to the end. END
BEGIN NOW Rastignac lowered his eyes, and acknowledged this kinship claimed by crime as an expiation of his own evil thoughts. END
BEGIN NOW Who betrayed me? END
BEGIN NOW said Collin, and his terrible eyes traveled round the room. END
BEGIN NOW Suddenly they rested on Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau. END
BEGIN NOW It was you, old cat! END
BEGIN NOW he said. END
BEGIN NOW That sham stroke of apoplexy was your doing, lynx eyes!... END
BEGIN NOW Two words from me, and your throat would be cut in less than a week, but I forgive you, I am a Christian. END
BEGIN NOW You did not sell me either. END
BEGIN NOW But who did?&mdash;-Aha! END
BEGIN NOW you may rummage upstairs, he shouted, hearing the police officers opening his cupboards and taking possession of his effects. END
BEGIN NOW The nest is empty, the birds flew away yesterday, and you will be none the wiser. END
BEGIN NOW My ledgers are here, he said tapping his forehead. END
BEGIN NOW Now I know who sold me! END
BEGIN NOW It could only be that blackguard Fil-de-Soie. END
BEGIN NOW That is who it was, old catchpoll, eh? END
BEGIN NOW he said, turning to the chief. END
BEGIN NOW It was timed so neatly to get the banknotes up above there. END
BEGIN NOW There is nothing left for you&mdash;spies! END
BEGIN NOW As for Fil-de-Soie, he will be under the daisies in less than a fortnight, even if you were to tell off the whole force to protect him. END
BEGIN NOW How much did you give the Michonnette? END
BEGIN NOW he asked of the police officers. END
BEGIN NOW A thousand crowns? END
BEGIN NOW Oh you Ninon in decay, Pompadour in tatters, Venus of the graveyard, I was worth more than that! END
BEGIN NOW If you had given me warning, you should have had six thousand francs. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW you had no suspicion of that, old trafficker in flesh and blood, or I should have had the preference. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, I would have given six thousand francs to save myself an inconvenient journey and some loss of money, he said, as they fastened the handcuffs on his wrists. END
BEGIN NOW These folks will amuse themselves by dragging out this business till the end of time to keep me idle. END
BEGIN NOW If they were to send me straight to jail, I should soon be back at my old tricks in spite of the duffers at the Quai des Orfevres. END
BEGIN NOW Down yonder they will all turn themselves inside out to help their general&mdash;their good Trompe-la-Mort&mdash;to get clear away. END
BEGIN NOW Is there a single one among you that can say, as I can, that he has ten thousand brothers ready to do anything for him? END
BEGIN NOW he asked proudly. END
BEGIN NOW There is some good there, he said tapping his heart; I have never betrayed any one!&mdash;Look you here, you slut, he said to the old maid, they are all afraid of me, do you see? END
BEGIN NOW but the sight of you turns them sick. END
BEGIN NOW Rake in your gains. END
BEGIN NOW He was silent for a moment, and looked round at the lodgers' faces. END
BEGIN NOW What dolts you are, all of you! END
BEGIN NOW Have you never seen a convict before? END
BEGIN NOW A convict of Collin's stamp, whom you see before you, is a man less weak-kneed than others; he lifts up his voice against the colossal fraud of the Social Contract, as Jean Jacques did, whose pupil he is proud to declare himself. END
BEGIN NOW In short, I stand here single-handed against a Government and a whole subsidized machinery of tribunals and police, and I am a match for them all. END
BEGIN NOW Ye gods! END
BEGIN NOW cried the painter, what a magnificent sketch one might make of him! END
BEGIN NOW Look here, you gentlemen-in-waiting to his highness the gibbet, master of ceremonies to the widow (a nickname full of sombre poetry, given by prisoners to the guillotine), be a good fellow, and tell me if it really was Fil-de-Soie who sold me. END
BEGIN NOW I don't want him to suffer for some one else, that would not be fair. END
BEGIN NOW But before the chief had time to answer, the rest of the party returned from making their investigations upstairs. END
BEGIN NOW Everything had been opened and inventoried. END
BEGIN NOW A few words passed between them and the chief, and the official preliminaries were complete. END
BEGIN NOW Gentlemen, said Collin, addressing the lodgers, they will take me away directly. END
BEGIN NOW You have all made my stay among you very agreeable, and I shall look back upon it with gratitude. END
BEGIN NOW Receive my adieux, and permit me to send you figs from Provence. END
BEGIN NOW He advanced a step or two, and then turned to look once more at Rastignac. END
BEGIN NOW Good-bye, Eugene, he said, in a sad and gentle tone, a strange transition from his previous rough and stern manner. END
BEGIN NOW If you should be hard up, I have left you a devoted friend, and, in spite of his shackles, he managed to assume a posture of defence, called, One, two! END
BEGIN NOW like a fencing-master, and lunged. END
BEGIN NOW If anything goes wrong, apply in that quarter. END
BEGIN NOW Man and money, all at your service. END
BEGIN NOW The strange speaker's manner was sufficiently burlesque, so that no one but Rastignac knew that there was a serious meaning underlying the pantomime. END
BEGIN NOW As soon as the police, soldiers, and detectives had left the house, Sylvie, who was rubbing her mistress' temples with vinegar, looked round at the bewildered lodgers. END
BEGIN NOW Well, said she, he was a man, he was, for all that. END
BEGIN NOW Her words broke the spell. END
BEGIN NOW Every one had been too much excited, too much moved by very various feelings to speak. END
BEGIN NOW But now the lodgers began to look at each other, and then all eyes were turned at once on Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau, a thin, shriveled, dead-alive, mummy-like figure, crouching by the stove; her eyes were downcast, as if she feared that the green eye-shade could not shut out the expression of those faces from her. END
BEGIN NOW This figure and the feeling of repulsion she had so long excited were explained all at once. END
BEGIN NOW A smothered murmur filled the room; it was so unanimous, that it seemed as if the same feeling of loathing had pitched all the voices in one key. END
BEGIN NOW Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau heard it, and did not stir. END
BEGIN NOW It was Bianchon who was the first to move; he bent over his neighbor, and said in a low voice, If that creature is going to stop here, and have dinner with us, I shall clear out. END
BEGIN NOW In the twinkling of an eye it was clear that every one in the room, save Poiret, was of the medical student's opinion, so that the latter, strong in the support of the majority, went up to that elderly person. END
BEGIN NOW You are more intimate with Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau than the rest of us, he said; speak to her, make her understand that she must go, and go at once. END
BEGIN NOW At once! END
BEGIN NOW echoed Poiret in amazement. END
BEGIN NOW Then he went across to the crouching figure, and spoke a few words in her ear. END
BEGIN NOW I have paid beforehand for the quarter; I have as much right to be here as any one else, she said, with a viperous look at the boarders. END
BEGIN NOW Never mind that! END
BEGIN NOW we will club together and pay you the money back, said Rastignac. END
BEGIN NOW Monsieur is taking Collin's part she said, with a questioning, malignant glance at the law student; it is not difficult to guess why. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene started forward at the words, as if he meant to spring upon her and wring her neck. END
BEGIN NOW That glance, and the depths of treachery that it revealed, had been a hideous enlightenment. END
BEGIN NOW Let her alone! END
BEGIN NOW cried the boarders. END
BEGIN NOW Rastignac folded his arms and was silent. END
BEGIN NOW Let us have no more of Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Judas, said the painter, turning to Vauquer. END
BEGIN NOW If you don't show the Michonneau the door, madame, we shall all leave your shop, and wherever we go we shall say that there are only convicts and spies left there. END
BEGIN NOW If you do the other thing, we will hold our tongues about the business; for when all is said and done, it might happen in the best society until they brand them on the forehead, when they send them to the hulks. END
BEGIN NOW They ought not to let convicts go about Paris disguised like decent citizens, so as to carry on their antics like a set of rascally humbugs, which they are. END
BEGIN NOW At this Vauquer recovered miraculously. END
BEGIN NOW She sat up and folded her arms; her eyes were wide open now, and there was no sign of tears in them. END
BEGIN NOW Why, do you really mean to be the ruin of my establishment, my dear sir? END
BEGIN NOW There is M. Vautrin&mdash;-Goodness, she cried, interrupting herself, I can't help calling him by the name he passed himself off by for an honest man! END
BEGIN NOW There is one room to let already, and you want me to turn out two more lodgers in the middle of the season, when no one is moving&mdash;- Gentlemen, let us take our hats and go and dine at Flicoteaux's in the Place Sorbonne, cried Bianchon. END
BEGIN NOW Vauquer glanced round, and saw in a moment on which side her interest lay. END
BEGIN NOW She waddled across to Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau. END
BEGIN NOW Come, now, she said; you would not be the ruin of my establishment, would you, eh? END
BEGIN NOW There's a dear, kind soul. END
BEGIN NOW You see what a pass these gentlemen have brought me to; just go up to your room for this evening. END
BEGIN NOW Never a bit of it! END
BEGIN NOW cried the boarders. END
BEGIN NOW She must go, and go this minute! END
BEGIN NOW But the poor lady has had no dinner, said Poiret, with piteous entreaty. END
BEGIN NOW She can go and dine where she likes, shouted several voices. END
BEGIN NOW Turn her out, the spy! END
BEGIN NOW Turn them both out! END
BEGIN NOW Spies! END
BEGIN NOW Gentlemen, cried Poiret, his heart swelling with the courage that love gives to the ovine male, respect the weaker sex. END
BEGIN NOW Spies are of no sex! END
BEGIN NOW said the painter. END
BEGIN NOW A precious sexorama! END
BEGIN NOW Turn her into the streetorama! END
BEGIN NOW Gentlemen, this is not manners! END
BEGIN NOW If you turn people out of the house, it ought not to be done so unceremoniously and with no notice at all. END
BEGIN NOW We have paid our money, and we are not going, said Poiret, putting on his cap, and taking a chair beside Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau, with whom Vauquer was remonstrating. END
BEGIN NOW Naughty boy! END
BEGIN NOW said the painter, with a comical look; run away, naughty little boy! END
BEGIN NOW Look here, said Bianchon; if you do not go, all the rest of us will, and the boarders, to a man, made for the sitting-room-door. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW mademoiselle, what is to be done? END
BEGIN NOW cried Vauquer. END
BEGIN NOW I am a ruined woman. END
BEGIN NOW You can't stay here; they will go further, do something violent. END
BEGIN NOW Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau rose to her feet. END
BEGIN NOW She is going!&mdash;She is not going!&mdash;She is going!&mdash;No, she isn't. END
BEGIN NOW These alternate exclamations, and a suggestion of hostile intentions, borne out by the behavior of the insurgents, compelled Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau to take her departure. END
BEGIN NOW She made some stipulations, speaking in a low voice in her hostess' ear, and then&mdash; I shall go to Buneaud's, she said, with a threatening look. END
BEGIN NOW Go where you please, mademoiselle, said Vauquer, who regarded this choice of an opposition establishment as an atrocious insult. END
BEGIN NOW Go and lodge with the Buneaud; the wine would give a cat the colic, and the food is cheap and nasty. END
BEGIN NOW The boarders stood aside in two rows to let her pass; not a word was spoken. END
BEGIN NOW Poiret looked so wistfully after Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau, and so artlessly revealed that he was in two minds whether to go or stay, that the boarders, in their joy at being quit of Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau, burst out laughing at the sight of him. END
BEGIN NOW Hist!&mdash;st!&mdash;st! END
BEGIN NOW Poiret, shouted the painter. END
BEGIN NOW Hallo! END
BEGIN NOW I say, Poiret, hallo! END
BEGIN NOW The _employe_ from the Museum began to sing: Partant pour la Syrie, Le jeune et beau Dunois... Get along with you; you must be dying to go, _trahit sua quemque voluptas!_ said Bianchon. END
BEGIN NOW Every one to his taste&mdash;free rendering from Virgil, said the tutor. END
BEGIN NOW Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau made a movement as if to take Poiret's arm, with an appealing glance that he could not resist. END
BEGIN NOW The two went out together, the old maid leaning upon him, and there was a burst of applause, followed by peals of laughter. END
BEGIN NOW Bravo, Poiret! END
BEGIN NOW Who would have thought it of old Poiret! END
BEGIN NOW Apollo Poiret! END
BEGIN NOW Mars Poiret! END
BEGIN NOW Intrepid Poiret! END
BEGIN NOW A messenger came in at that moment with a letter for Vauquer, who read it through, and collapsed in her chair. END
BEGIN NOW The house might as well be burned down at once, cried she, if there are to be any more of these thunderbolts! END
BEGIN NOW Young Taillefer died at three o'clock this afternoon. END
BEGIN NOW It serves me right for wishing well to those ladies at that poor man's expense. END
BEGIN NOW Couture and Victorine want me to send their things, because they are going to live with her father. END
BEGIN NOW M. Taillefer allows his daughter to keep old Couture as her lady companion. END
BEGIN NOW Four rooms to let! END
BEGIN NOW and five lodgers gone!... END
BEGIN NOW She sat up, and seemed about to burst into tears. END
BEGIN NOW Bad luck has come to lodge here, I think, she cried. END
BEGIN NOW Once more there came a sound of wheels from the street outside. END
BEGIN NOW What! END
BEGIN NOW another windfall for somebody! END
BEGIN NOW was Sylvie's comment. END
BEGIN NOW But it was Goriot who came in, looking so radiant, so flushed with happiness, that he seemed to have grown young again. END
BEGIN NOW Goriot in a cab! END
BEGIN NOW cried the boarders; the world is coming to an end. END
BEGIN NOW The good soul made straight for Eugene, who was standing wrapped in thought in a corner, and laid a hand on the young man's arm. END
BEGIN NOW Come, he said, with gladness in his eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Then you haven't heard the news? END
BEGIN NOW said Eugene. END
BEGIN NOW Vautrin was an escaped convict; they have just arrested him; and young Taillefer is dead. END
BEGIN NOW Very well, but what business is it of ours? END
BEGIN NOW replied Father Goriot. END
BEGIN NOW I am going to dine with my daughter in _your house_, do you understand? END
BEGIN NOW She is expecting you. END
BEGIN NOW Come! END
BEGIN NOW He carried off Rastignac with him by main force, and they departed in as great a hurry as a pair of eloping lovers. END
BEGIN NOW Now, let us have dinner, cried the painter, and every one drew his chair to the table. END
BEGIN NOW Well, I never, said the portly Sylvie. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing goes right to-day! END
BEGIN NOW The haricot mutton has caught! END
BEGIN NOW Bah! END
BEGIN NOW you will have to eat it, burned as it is, more's the pity! END
BEGIN NOW Vauquer was so dispirited that she could not say a word as she looked round the table and saw only ten people where eighteen should be; but every one tried to comfort and cheer her. END
BEGIN NOW At first the dinner contingent, as was natural, talked about Vautrin and the day's events; but the conversation wound round to such topics of interest as duels, jails, justice, prison life, and alterations that ought to be made in the laws. END
BEGIN NOW They soon wandered miles away from Jacques Collin and Victorine and her brother. END
BEGIN NOW There might be only ten of them, but they made noise enough for twenty; indeed, there seemed to be more of them than usual; that was the only difference between yesterday and to-day. END
BEGIN NOW Indifference to the fate of others is a matter of course in this selfish world, which, on the morrow of tragedy, seeks among the events of Paris for a fresh sensation for its daily renewed appetite, and this indifference soon gained the upper hand. END
BEGIN NOW Vauquer herself grew calmer under the soothing influence of hope, and the mouthpiece of hope was the portly Sylvie. END
BEGIN NOW That day had gone by like a dream for Eugene, and the sense of unreality lasted into the evening; so that, in spite of his energetic character and clear-headedness, his ideas were a chaos as he sat beside Goriot in the cab. END
BEGIN NOW The old man's voice was full of unwonted happiness, but Eugene had been shaken by so many emotions that the words sounded in his ears like words spoken in a dream. END
BEGIN NOW It was finished this morning! END
BEGIN NOW All three of us are going to dine there together, together! END
BEGIN NOW Do you understand? END
BEGIN NOW I have not dined with my Delphine, my little Delphine, these four years, and I shall have her for a whole evening! END
BEGIN NOW We have been at your lodging the whole time since morning. END
BEGIN NOW I have been working like a porter in my shirt sleeves, helping to carry in the furniture. END
BEGIN NOW Aha! END
BEGIN NOW you don't know what pretty ways she has; at table she will look after me, 'Here, papa, just try this, it is nice.' END
BEGIN NOW And I shall not be able to eat. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, it is a long while since I have been with her in quiet every-day life as we shall have her. END
BEGIN NOW It really seems as if the world has been turned upside down. END
BEGIN NOW Upside down? END
BEGIN NOW repeated Father Goriot. END
BEGIN NOW Why, the world has never been so right-side up. END
BEGIN NOW I see none but smiling faces in the streets, people who shake hands cordially and embrace each other, people who all look as happy as if they were going to dine with their daughter, and gobble down a nice little dinner that she went with me to order of the chef at the Cafe des Anglais. END
BEGIN NOW But, pshaw! END
BEGIN NOW with her beside you gall and wormwood would be as sweet as honey. END
BEGIN NOW I feel as if I were coming back to life again, said Eugene. END
BEGIN NOW Why, hurry up there! END
BEGIN NOW cried Father Goriot, letting down the window in front. END
BEGIN NOW Get on faster; I will give you five francs if you get to the place I told you of in ten minutes time. END
BEGIN NOW With this prospect before him the cabman crossed Paris with miraculous celerity. END
BEGIN NOW How that fellow crawls! END
BEGIN NOW said Father Goriot. END
BEGIN NOW But where are you taking me? END
BEGIN NOW Eugene asked him. END
BEGIN NOW To your own house, said Goriot. END
BEGIN NOW The cab stopped in the Rue d'Artois. END
BEGIN NOW Father Goriot stepped out first and flung ten francs to the man with the recklessness of a widower returning to bachelor ways. END
BEGIN NOW Come along upstairs, he said to Rastignac. END
BEGIN NOW They crossed a courtyard, and climbed up to the third floor of a new and handsome house. END
BEGIN NOW There they stopped before a door; but before Goriot could ring, it was opened by Therese, de Nucingen's maid. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene found himself in a charming set of chambers; an ante-room, a little drawing-room, a bedroom, and a study, looking out upon a garden. END
BEGIN NOW The furniture and the decorations of the little drawing-room were of the most daintily charming description, the room was full of soft light, and Delphine rose up from a low chair by the fire and stood before him. END
BEGIN NOW She set her fire-screen down on the chimney-piece, and spoke with tenderness in every tone of her voice. END
BEGIN NOW So we had to go in search of you, sir, you who are so slow to understand! END
BEGIN NOW Therese left the room. END
BEGIN NOW The student took Delphine in his arms and held her in a tight clasp, his eyes filled with tears of joy. END
BEGIN NOW This last contrast between his present surroundings and the scenes he had just witnessed was too much for Rastignac's over-wrought nerves, after the day's strain and excitement that had wearied heart and brain; he was almost overcome by it. END
BEGIN NOW I felt sure myself that he loved you, murmured Father Goriot, while Eugene lay back bewildered on the sofa, utterly unable to speak a word or to reason out how and why the magic wand had been waved to bring about this final transformation scene. END
BEGIN NOW But you must see your rooms, said de Nucingen. END
BEGIN NOW She took his hand and led him into a room carpeted and furnished like her own; indeed, down to the smallest details, it was a reproduction in miniature of Delphine's apartment. END
BEGIN NOW There is no bed, said Rastignac. END
BEGIN NOW No, monsieur, she answered, reddening, and pressing his hand. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene, looking at her, understood, young though he yet was, how deeply modesty is implanted in the heart of a woman who loves. END
BEGIN NOW You are one of those beings whom we cannot choose but to adore for ever, he said in her ear. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, the deeper and truer love is, the more mysterious and closely veiled it should be; I can dare to say so, since we understand each other so well. END
BEGIN NOW No one shall learn our secret. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW so I am nobody, I suppose, growled the father. END
BEGIN NOW You know quite well that 'we' means you. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW that is what I wanted. END
BEGIN NOW You will not mind me, will you? END
BEGIN NOW I shall go and come like a good fairy who makes himself felt everywhere without being seen, shall I not? END
BEGIN NOW Eh, Delphinette, Ninette, Dedel&mdash;was it not a good idea of mine to say to you, 'There are some nice rooms to let in the Rue d'Artois; let us furnish them for him?' END
BEGIN NOW And she would not hear of it! END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW your happiness has been all my doing. END
BEGIN NOW I am the author of your happiness and of your existence. END
BEGIN NOW Fathers must always be giving if they would be happy themselves; always giving&mdash;they would not be fathers else. END
BEGIN NOW Was that how it happened? END
BEGIN NOW asked Eugene. END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW She would not listen to me. END
BEGIN NOW She was afraid that people would talk, as if the rubbish that they say about you were to be compared with happiness! END
BEGIN NOW Why, all women dream of doing what she has done&mdash;- Father Goriot found himself without an audience, for de Nucingen had led Rastignac into the study; he heard a kiss given and taken, low though the sound was. END
BEGIN NOW The study was furnished as elegantly as the other rooms, and nothing was wanting there. END
BEGIN NOW Have we guessed your wishes rightly? END
BEGIN NOW she asked, as they returned to the drawing-room for dinner. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, he said, only too well, alas! END
BEGIN NOW For all this luxury so well carried out, this realization of pleasant dreams, the elegance that satisfies all the romantic fancies of youth, appeals to me so strongly that I cannot but feel that it is my rightful possession, but I cannot accept it from you, and I am too poor as yet to&mdash;- Ah! END
BEGIN NOW ah! END
BEGIN NOW you say me nay already, she said with arch imperiousness, and a charming little pout of the lips, a woman's way of laughing away scruples. END
BEGIN NOW But Eugene had submitted so lately to that solemn self-questioning, and Vautrin's arrest had so plainly shown him the depths of the pit that lay ready to his feet, that the instincts of generosity and honor had been strengthened in him, and he could not allow himself to be coaxed into abandoning his high-minded determinations. END
BEGIN NOW Profound melancholy filled his mind. END
BEGIN NOW Do you really mean to refuse? END
BEGIN NOW said de Nucingen. END
BEGIN NOW And do you know what such a refusal means? END
BEGIN NOW That you are not sure of yourself, that you do not dare to bind yourself to me. END
BEGIN NOW Are you really afraid of betraying my affection? END
BEGIN NOW If you love me, if I&mdash;love you, why should you shrink back from such a slight obligation? END
BEGIN NOW If you but knew what a pleasure it has been to see after all the arrangements of this bachelor establishment, you would not hesitate any longer, you would ask me to forgive you for your hesitation. END
BEGIN NOW I had some money that belonged to you, and I have made good use of it, that is all. END
BEGIN NOW You mean this for magnanimity, but it is very little of you. END
BEGIN NOW You are asking me for far more than this.... Ah! END
BEGIN NOW she cried, as Eugene's passionate glance was turned on her, and you are making difficulties about the merest trifles. END
BEGIN NOW Of, if you feel no love whatever for me, refuse, by all means. END
BEGIN NOW My fate hangs on a word from you. END
BEGIN NOW Speak!&mdash;Father, she said after a pause, make him listen to reason. END
BEGIN NOW Can he imagine that I am less nice than he is on the point of honor? END
BEGIN NOW Father Goriot was looking on and listening to this pretty quarrel with a placid smile, as if he had found some balm for all the sorrows of life. END
BEGIN NOW Child that you are! END
BEGIN NOW she cried again, catching Eugene's hand. END
BEGIN NOW You are just beginning life; you find barriers at the outset that many a man finds insurmountable; a woman's hand opens the way and you shrink back! END
BEGIN NOW Why, you are sure to succeed! END
BEGIN NOW You will have a brilliant future. END
BEGIN NOW Success is written on that broad forehead of yours, and will you not be able to repay me my loan of to-day? END
BEGIN NOW Did not a lady in olden times arm her knight with sword and helmet and coat of mail, and find him a charger, so that he might fight for her in the tournament? END
BEGIN NOW Well, then, Eugene, these things that I offer you are the weapons of this age; every one who means to be something must have such tools as these. END
BEGIN NOW A pretty place your garret must be if it is like papa's room! END
BEGIN NOW See, dinner is waiting all this time. END
BEGIN NOW Do you want to make me unhappy?&mdash;Why don't you answer? END
BEGIN NOW she said, shaking his hand. END
BEGIN NOW _Mon Dieu!_ papa, make up his mind for him, or I will go away and never see him any more. END
BEGIN NOW I will make up your mind, said Goriot, coming down from the clouds. END
BEGIN NOW Now, my dear M. Eugene, the next thing is to borrow money of the Jews, isn't it? END
BEGIN NOW There is positively no help for it, said Eugene. END
BEGIN NOW All right, I will give you credit, said the other, drawing out a cheap leather pocket-book, much the worse for wear. END
BEGIN NOW I have turned Jew myself; I paid for everything; here are the invoices. END
BEGIN NOW You do not owe a penny for anything here. END
BEGIN NOW It did not come to very much&mdash;five thousand francs at most, and I am going to lend you the money myself. END
BEGIN NOW I am not a woman&mdash;you can refuse me. END
BEGIN NOW You shall give me a receipt on a scrap of paper, and you can return it some time or other. END
BEGIN NOW Delphine and Eugene looked at each other in amazement, tears sprang to their eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Rastignac held out his hand and grasped Goriot's warmly. END
BEGIN NOW Well, what is all this about? END
BEGIN NOW Are you not my children? END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW my poor father, said de Nucingen, how did you do it? END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW now you ask me. END
BEGIN NOW When I made up my mind to move him nearer to you, and saw you buying things as if they were wedding presents, I said to myself, 'She will never be able to pay for them.' END
BEGIN NOW The attorney says that those law proceedings will last quite six months before your husband can be made to disgorge your fortune. END
BEGIN NOW Well and good. END
BEGIN NOW I sold out my property in the funds that brought in thirteen hundred and fifty livres a year, and bought a safe annuity of twelve hundred francs a year for fifteen thousand francs. END
BEGIN NOW Then I paid your tradesmen out of the rest of the capital. END
BEGIN NOW As for me, children, I have a room upstairs for which I pay fifty crowns a year; I can live like a prince on two francs a day, and still have something left over. END
BEGIN NOW I shall not have to spend anything much on clothes, for I never wear anything out. END
BEGIN NOW This fortnight past I have been laughing in my sleeve, thinking to myself, 'How happy they are going to be!' END
BEGIN NOW and&mdash;well, now, are you not happy? END
BEGIN NOW Oh papa! END
BEGIN NOW papa! END
BEGIN NOW cried de Nucingen, springing to her father, who took her on his knee. END
BEGIN NOW She covered him with kisses, her fair hair brushed his cheek, her tears fell on the withered face that had grown so bright and radiant. END
BEGIN NOW Dear father, what a father you are! END
BEGIN NOW No, there is not another father like you under the sun. END
BEGIN NOW If Eugene loved you before, what must he feel for you now? END
BEGIN NOW Why, children, why Delphinette! END
BEGIN NOW cried Goriot, who had not felt his daughter's heart beat against his breast for ten years, do you want me to die of joy? END
BEGIN NOW My poor heart will break! END
BEGIN NOW Come, Monsieur Eugene, we are quits already. END
BEGIN NOW And the old man strained her to his breast with such fierce and passionate force that she cried out. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW you are hurting me! END
BEGIN NOW she said. END
BEGIN NOW I am hurting you! END
BEGIN NOW He grew pale at the words. END
BEGIN NOW The pain expressed in his face seemed greater than it is given to humanity to know. END
BEGIN NOW The agony of this Christ of paternity can only be compared with the masterpieces of those princes of the palette who have left for us the record of their visions of an agony suffered for a whole world by the Saviour of men. END
BEGIN NOW Father Goriot pressed his lips very gently against the waist than his fingers had grasped too roughly. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW no, no, he cried. END
BEGIN NOW I have not hurt you, have I? END
BEGIN NOW and his smile seemed to repeat the question. END
BEGIN NOW YOU have hurt me with that cry just now.&mdash;The things cost rather more than that, he said in her ear, with another gentle kiss, but I had to deceive him about it, or he would have been angry. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene sat dumb with amazement in the presence of this inexhaustible love; he gazed at Goriot, and his face betrayed the artless admiration which shapes the beliefs of youth. END
BEGIN NOW I will be worthy of all this, he cried. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW my Eugene, that is nobly said, and de Nucingen kissed the law student on the forehead. END
BEGIN NOW He gave up Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Taillefer and her millions for you, said Father Goriot. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, the little thing was in love with you, and now that her brother is dead she is as rich as Croesus. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW why did you tell her? END
BEGIN NOW cried Rastignac. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene, Delphine said in his ear, I have one regret now this evening. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW how I will love you! END
BEGIN NOW and for ever! END
BEGIN NOW This is the happiest day I have had since you two were married! END
BEGIN NOW cried Goriot. END
BEGIN NOW God may send me any suffering, so long as I do not suffer through you, and I can still say, 'In this short month of February I had more happiness than other men have in their whole lives. END
BEGIN NOW '&mdash;Look at me, Fifine! END
BEGIN NOW he said to his daughter. END
BEGIN NOW She is very beautiful, is she not? END
BEGIN NOW Tell me, now, have you seen many women with that pretty soft color&mdash;that little dimple of hers? END
BEGIN NOW No, I thought not. END
BEGIN NOW Ah, well, and but for me this lovely woman would never have been. END
BEGIN NOW And very soon happiness will make her a thousand times lovelier, happiness through you. END
BEGIN NOW I could give up my place in heaven to you, neighbor, if needs be, and go down to hell instead. END
BEGIN NOW Come, let us have dinner, he added, scarcely knowing what he said, everything is ours. END
BEGIN NOW Poor dear father! END
BEGIN NOW He rose and went over to her, and took her face in his hands, and set a kiss on the plaits of hair. END
BEGIN NOW If you only knew, little one, how happy you can make me&mdash;how little it takes to make me happy! END
BEGIN NOW Will you come and see me sometimes? END
BEGIN NOW I shall be just above, so it is only a step. END
BEGIN NOW Promise me, say that you will! END
BEGIN NOW Yes, dear father. END
BEGIN NOW Say it again. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, I will, my kind father. END
BEGIN NOW Hush! END
BEGIN NOW hush! END
BEGIN NOW I should make you say it a hundred times over if I followed my own wishes. END
BEGIN NOW Let us have dinner. END
BEGIN NOW The three behaved like children that evening, and Father Goriot's spirits were certainly not the least wild. END
BEGIN NOW He lay at his daughter's feet, kissed them, gazed into her eyes, rubbed his head against her dress; in short, no young lover could have been more extravagant or more tender. END
BEGIN NOW You see! END
BEGIN NOW Delphine said with a look at Eugene, so long as my father is with us, he monopolizes me. END
BEGIN NOW He will be rather in the way sometimes. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene had himself already felt certain twinges of jealousy, and could not blame this speech that contained the germ of all ingratitude. END
BEGIN NOW And when will the rooms be ready? END
BEGIN NOW asked Eugene, looking round. END
BEGIN NOW We must all leave them this evening, I suppose. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, but to-morrow you must come and dine with me, she answered, with an eloquent glance. END
BEGIN NOW It is our night at the Italiens. END
BEGIN NOW I shall go to the pit, said her father. END
BEGIN NOW It was midnight. END
BEGIN NOW de Nucingen's carriage was waiting for her, and Father Goriot and the student walked back to the Maison Vauquer, talking of Delphine, and warming over their talk till there grew up a curious rivalry between the two violent passions. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene could not help seeing that the father's self-less love was deeper and more steadfast than his own. END
BEGIN NOW For this worshiper Delphine was always pure and fair, and her father's adoration drew its fervor from a whole past as well as a future of love. END
BEGIN NOW They found Vauquer by the stove, with Sylvie and Christophe to keep her company; the old landlady, sitting like Marius among the ruins of Carthage, was waiting for the two lodgers that yet remained to her, and bemoaning her lot with the sympathetic Sylvie. END
BEGIN NOW Tasso's lamentations as recorded in Byron's poem are undoubtedly eloquent, but for sheer force of truth they fall far short of the widow's cry from the depths. END
BEGIN NOW Only three cups of coffee in the morning, Sylvie! END
BEGIN NOW Oh dear! END
BEGIN NOW to have your house emptied in this way is enough to break your heart. END
BEGIN NOW What is life, now my lodgers are gone? END
BEGIN NOW Nothing at all. END
BEGIN NOW Just think of it! END
BEGIN NOW It is just as if all the furniture had been taken out of the house, and your furniture is your life. END
BEGIN NOW How have I offended heaven to draw down all this trouble upon me? END
BEGIN NOW And haricot beans and potatoes laid in for twenty people! END
BEGIN NOW The police in my house too! END
BEGIN NOW We shall have to live on potatoes now, and Christophe will have to go! END
BEGIN NOW The Savoyard, who was fast asleep, suddenly woke up at this, and said, Madame, questioningly. END
BEGIN NOW Poor fellow! END
BEGIN NOW said Sylvie, he is like a dog. END
BEGIN NOW In the dead season, too! END
BEGIN NOW Nobody is moving now. END
BEGIN NOW I would like to know where the lodgers are to drop down from. END
BEGIN NOW It drives me distracted. END
BEGIN NOW And that old witch of a Michonneau goes and takes Poiret with her! END
BEGIN NOW What can she have done to make him so fond of her? END
BEGIN NOW He runs about after her like a little dog. END
BEGIN NOW Lord! END
BEGIN NOW said Sylvie, flinging up her head, those old maids are up to all sorts of tricks. END
BEGIN NOW There's that poor M. Vautrin that they made out to be a convict, the widow went on. END
BEGIN NOW Well, you know that is too much for me, Sylvie; I can't bring myself to believe it. END
BEGIN NOW Such a lively man as he was, and paid fifteen francs a month for his coffee of an evening, paid you very penny on the nail too. END
BEGIN NOW And open-handed he was! END
BEGIN NOW said Christophe. END
BEGIN NOW There is some mistake, said Sylvie. END
BEGIN NOW Why, no there isn't! END
BEGIN NOW he said so himself! END
BEGIN NOW said Vauquer. END
BEGIN NOW And to think that all these things have happened in my house, and in a quarter where you never see a cat go by. END
BEGIN NOW On my word as an honest woman, it's like a dream. END
BEGIN NOW For, look here, we saw Louis XVI. END
BEGIN NOW meet with his mishap; we saw the fall of the Emperor; and we saw him come back and fall again; there was nothing out of the way in all that, but lodging-houses are not liable to revolutions. END
BEGIN NOW You can do without a king, but you must eat all the same; and so long as a decent woman, a de Conflans born and bred, will give you all sorts of good things for dinner, nothing short of the end of the world ought to&mdash;but there, it is the end of the world, that is just what it is! END
BEGIN NOW And to think that Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW Michonneau who made all this mischief is to have a thousand crowns a year for it, so I hear, cried Sylvie. END
BEGIN NOW Don't speak of her, she is a wicked woman! END
BEGIN NOW said Vauquer. END
BEGIN NOW She is going to the Buneaud, who charges less than cost. END
BEGIN NOW But the Buneaud is capable of anything; she must have done frightful things, robbed and murdered people in her time. END
BEGIN NOW _She_ ought to be put in jail for life instead of that poor dear&mdash;- Eugene and Goriot rang the door-bell at that moment. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW here are my two faithful lodgers, said the widow, sighing. END
BEGIN NOW But the two faithful lodgers, who retained but shadowy recollections of the misfortunes of their lodging-house, announced to their hostess without more ado that they were about to remove to the Chaussee d'Antin. END
BEGIN NOW Sylvie! END
BEGIN NOW cried the widow, this is the last straw.&mdash;Gentlemen, this will be the death of me! END
BEGIN NOW It has quite upset me! END
BEGIN NOW There's a weight on my chest! END
BEGIN NOW I am ten years older for this day! END
BEGIN NOW Upon my word, I shall go out of my senses! END
BEGIN NOW And what is to be done with the haricots!&mdash;Oh, well, if I am to be left here all by myself, you shall go to-morrow, Christophe.&mdash;Good-night, gentlemen, and she went. END
BEGIN NOW What is the matter now? END
BEGIN NOW Eugene inquired of Sylvie. END
BEGIN NOW Lord! END
BEGIN NOW everybody is going about his business, and that has addled her wits. END
BEGIN NOW There! END
BEGIN NOW she is crying upstairs. END
BEGIN NOW It will do her good to snivel a bit. END
BEGIN NOW It's the first time she has cried since I've been with her. END
BEGIN NOW By the morning, Vauquer, to use her own expression, had made up her mind to it. END
BEGIN NOW True, she still wore a doleful countenance, as might be expected of a woman who had lost all her lodgers, and whose manner of life had been suddenly revolutionized, but she had all her wits about her. END
BEGIN NOW Her grief was genuine and profound; it was real pain of mind, for her purse had suffered, the routine of her existence had been broken. END
BEGIN NOW A lover's farewell glance at his lady-love's window is not more mournful than Vauquer's survey of the empty places round her table. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene administered comfort, telling the widow that Bianchon, whose term of residence at the hospital was about to expire, would doubtless take his (Rastignac's) place; that the official from the Museum had often expressed a desire to have Couture's rooms; and that in a very few days her household would be on the old footing. END
BEGIN NOW God send it may, my dear sir! END
BEGIN NOW but bad luck has come to lodge here. END
BEGIN NOW There'll be a death in the house before ten days are out, you'll see, and she gave a lugubrious look round the dining-room. END
BEGIN NOW Whose turn will it be, I wonder? END
BEGIN NOW It is just as well that we are moving out, said Eugene to Father Goriot in a low voice. END
BEGIN NOW Madame, said Sylvie, running in with a scared face, I have not seen Mistigris these three days. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW well, if my cat is dead, if _he_ has gone and left us, I&mdash;- The poor woman could not finish her sentence; she clasped her hands and hid her face on the back of her armchair, quite overcome by this dreadful portent. END
BEGIN NOW By twelve o'clock, when the postman reaches that quarter, Eugene received a letter. END
BEGIN NOW The dainty envelope bore the Beauseant arms on the seal, and contained an invitation to the Vicomtesse's great ball, which had been talked of in Paris for a month. END
BEGIN NOW A little note for Eugene was slipped in with the card. END
BEGIN NOW I think, monsieur, that you will undertake with pleasure to interpret my sentiments to de Nucingen, so I am sending the card for which you asked me to you. END
BEGIN NOW I shall be delighted to make the acquaintance of de Restaud's sister. END
BEGIN NOW Pray introduce that charming lady to me, and do not let her monopolize all your affection, for you owe me not a little in return for mine. END
BEGIN NOW VICOMTESSE DE BEAUSEANT. END
BEGIN NOW Well, said Eugene to himself, as he read the note a second time, de Beauseant says pretty plainly that she does not want the Baron de Nucingen. END
BEGIN NOW He went to Delphine at once in his joy. END
BEGIN NOW He had procured this pleasure for her, and doubtless he would receive the price of it. END
BEGIN NOW de Nucingen was dressing. END
BEGIN NOW Rastignac waited in her boudoir, enduring as best he might the natural impatience of an eager temperament for the reward desired and withheld for a year. END
BEGIN NOW Such sensations are only known once in a life. END
BEGIN NOW The first woman to whom a man is drawn, if she is really a woman&mdash;that is to say, if she appears to him amid the splendid accessories that form a necessary background to life in the world of Paris&mdash;will never have a rival. END
BEGIN NOW Love in Paris is a thing distinct and apart; for in Paris neither men nor women are the dupes of the commonplaces by which people seek to throw a veil over their motives, or to parade a fine affectation of disinterestedness in their sentiments. END
BEGIN NOW In this country within a country, it is not merely required of a woman that she should satisfy the senses and the soul; she knows perfectly well that she has still greater obligations to discharge, that she must fulfil the countless demands of a vanity that enters into every fibre of that living organism called society. END
BEGIN NOW Love, for her, is above all things, and by its very nature, a vainglorious, brazen-fronted, ostentatious, thriftless charlatan. END
BEGIN NOW If at the Court of Louis XIV. END
BEGIN NOW there was not a woman but envied Mlle. END
BEGIN NOW de la Valliere the reckless devotion of passion that led the grand monarch to tear the priceless ruffles at his wrists in order to assist the entry of a Duc de Vermandois into the world&mdash;what can you expect of the rest of society? END
BEGIN NOW You must have youth and wealth and rank; nay, you must, if possible, have more than these, for the more incense you bring with you to burn at the shrine of the god, the more favorably will he regard the worshiper. END
BEGIN NOW Love is a religion, and his cult must in the nature of things be more costly than those of all other deities; Love the Spoiler stays for a moment, and then passes on; like the urchin of the streets, his course may be traced by the ravages that he has made. END
BEGIN NOW The wealth of feeling and imagination is the poetry of the garret; how should love exist there without that wealth? END
BEGIN NOW If there are exceptions who do not subscribe to these Draconian laws of the Parisian code, they are solitary examples. END
BEGIN NOW Such souls live so far out of the main current that they are not borne away by the doctrines of society; they dwell beside some clear spring of everflowing water, without seeking to leave the green shade; happy to listen to the echoes of the infinite in everything around them and in their own souls, waiting in patience to take their flight for heaven, while they look with pity upon those of earth. END
BEGIN NOW Rastignac, like most young men who have been early impressed by the circumstances of power and grandeur, meant to enter the lists fully armed; the burning ambition of conquest possessed him already; perhaps he was conscious of his powers, but as yet he knew neither the end to which his ambition was to be directed, nor the means of attaining it. END
BEGIN NOW In default of the pure and sacred love that fills a life, ambition may become something very noble, subduing to itself every thought of personal interest, and setting as the end&mdash;the greatness, not of one man, but of a whole nation. END
BEGIN NOW But the student had not yet reached the time of life when a man surveys the whole course of existence and judges it soberly. END
BEGIN NOW Hitherto he had scarcely so much as shaken off the spell of the fresh and gracious influences that envelop a childhood in the country, like green leaves and grass. END
BEGIN NOW He had hesitated on the brink of the Parisian Rubicon, and in spite of the prickings of ambition, he still clung to a lingering tradition of an old ideal&mdash;the peaceful life of the noble in his chateau. END
BEGIN NOW But yesterday evening, at the sight of his rooms, those scruples had vanished. END
BEGIN NOW He had learned what it was to enjoy the material advantages of fortune, as he had already enjoyed the social advantages of birth; he ceased to be a provincial from that moment, and slipped naturally and easily into a position which opened up a prospect of a brilliant future. END
BEGIN NOW So, as he waited for Delphine, in the pretty boudoir, where he felt that he had a certain right to be, he felt himself so far away from the Rastignac who came back to Paris a year ago, that, turning some power of inner vision upon this latter, he asked himself whether that past self bore any resemblance to the Rastignac of that moment. END
BEGIN NOW Madame is in her room, Therese came to tell him. END
BEGIN NOW The woman's voice made him start. END
BEGIN NOW He found Delphine lying back in her low chair by the fireside, looking fresh and bright. END
BEGIN NOW The sight of her among the flowing draperies of muslin suggested some beautiful tropical flower, where the fruit is set amid the blossom. END
BEGIN NOW Well, she said, with a tremor in her voice, here you are. END
BEGIN NOW Guess what I bring for you, said Eugene, sitting down beside her. END
BEGIN NOW He took possession of her arm to kiss her hand. END
BEGIN NOW de Nucingen gave a joyful start as she saw the card. END
BEGIN NOW She turned to Eugene; there were tears in her eyes as she flung her arms about his neck, and drew him towards her in a frenzy of gratified vanity. END
BEGIN NOW And I owe this happiness to you&mdash;to _thee_ (she whispered the more intimate word in his ear); but Therese is in my dressing-room, let us be prudent.&mdash;This happiness&mdash;yes, for I may call it so, when it comes to me through _you_&mdash;is surely more than a triumph for self-love? END
BEGIN NOW No one has been willing to introduce me into that set. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps just now I may seem to you to be frivolous, petty, shallow, like a Parisienne, but remember, my friend, that I am ready to give up all for you; and that if I long more than ever for an entrance into the Faubourg Saint-Germain, it is because I shall meet you there. END
BEGIN NOW de Beauseant's note seems to say very plainly that she does not expect to see the _Baron_ de Nucingen at her ball; don't you think so? END
BEGIN NOW said Eugene. END
BEGIN NOW Why, yes, said the Baroness as she returned the letter. END
BEGIN NOW Those women have a talent for insolence. END
BEGIN NOW But it is of no consequence, I shall go. END
BEGIN NOW My sister is sure to be there, and sure to be very beautifully dressed.&mdash;Eugene, she went on, lowering her voice, she will go to dispel ugly suspicions. END
BEGIN NOW You do not know the things that people are saying about her. END
BEGIN NOW Only this morning Nucingen came to tell me that they had been discussing her at the club. END
BEGIN NOW Great heavens! END
BEGIN NOW on what does a woman's character and the honor of a whole family depend! END
BEGIN NOW I feel that I am nearly touched and wounded in my poor sister. END
BEGIN NOW According to some people, M. de Trailles must have put his name to bills for a hundred thousand francs, nearly all of them are overdue, and proceedings are threatened. END
BEGIN NOW In this predicament, it seems that my sister sold her diamonds to a Jew&mdash;the beautiful diamonds that belonged to her husband's mother, de Restaud the elder,&mdash;you have seen her wearing them. END
BEGIN NOW In fact, nothing else has been talked about for the last two days. END
BEGIN NOW So I can see that Anastasie is sure to come to de Beauseant's ball in tissue of gold, and ablaze with diamonds, to draw all eyes upon her; and I will not be outshone. END
BEGIN NOW She has tried to eclipse me all her life, she has never been kind to me, and I have helped her so often, and always had money for her when she had none.&mdash;But never mind other people now, to-day I mean to be perfectly happy. END
BEGIN NOW At one o'clock that morning Eugene was still with de Nucingen. END
BEGIN NOW In the midst of their lovers' farewell, a farewell full of hope of bliss to come, she said in a troubled voice, I am very fearful, superstitious. END
BEGIN NOW Give what name you like to my presentiments, but I am afraid that my happiness will be paid for by some horrible catastrophe. END
BEGIN NOW Child! END
BEGIN NOW said Eugene. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW have we changed places, and am I the child to-night? END
BEGIN NOW she asked, laughingly. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene went back to the Maison Vauquer, never doubting but that he should leave it for good on the morrow; and on the way he fell to dreaming the bright dreams of youth, when the cup of happiness has left its sweetness on the lips. END
BEGIN NOW Well? END
BEGIN NOW cried Goriot, as Rastignac passed by his door. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, said Eugene; I will tell you everything to-morrow. END
BEGIN NOW Everything, will you not? END
BEGIN NOW cried the old man. END
BEGIN NOW Go to bed. END
BEGIN NOW To-morrow our happy life will begin. END
BEGIN NOW Next day, Goriot and Rastignac were ready to leave the lodging-house, and only awaited the good pleasure of a porter to move out of it; but towards noon there was a sound of wheels in the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve, and a carriage stopped before the door of the Maison Vauquer. END
BEGIN NOW de Nucingen alighted, and asked if her father was still in the house, and, receiving an affirmative reply from Sylvie, ran lightly upstairs. END
BEGIN NOW It so happened that Eugene was at home all unknown to his neighbor. END
BEGIN NOW At breakfast time he had asked Goriot to superintend the removal of his goods, saying that he would meet him in the Rue d'Artois at four o'clock; but Rastignac's name had been called early on the list at the Ecole de Droit, and he had gone back at once to the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve. END
BEGIN NOW No one had seen him come in, for Goriot had gone to find a porter, and the mistress of the house was likewise out. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene had thought to pay her himself, for it struck him that if he left this, Goriot in his zeal would probably pay for him. END
BEGIN NOW As it was, Eugene went up to his room to see that nothing had been forgotten, and blessed his foresight when he saw the blank bill bearing Vautrin's signature lying in the drawer where he had carelessly thrown it on the day when he had repaid the amount. END
BEGIN NOW There was no fire in the grate, so he was about to tear it into little pieces, when he heard a voice speaking in Goriot's room, and the speaker was Delphine! END
BEGIN NOW He made no more noise, and stood still to listen, thinking that she should have no secrets from him; but after the first few words, the conversation between the father and daughter was so strange and interesting that it absorbed all his attention. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW thank heaven that you thought of asking him to give an account of the money settled on me before I was utterly ruined, father. END
BEGIN NOW Is it safe to talk? END
BEGIN NOW she added. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, there is no one in the house, said her father faintly. END
BEGIN NOW What is the matter with you? END
BEGIN NOW asked de Nucingen. END
BEGIN NOW God forgive you! END
BEGIN NOW you have just dealt me a staggering blow, child! END
BEGIN NOW said the old man. END
BEGIN NOW You cannot know how much I love you, or you would not have burst in upon me like this, with such news, especially if all is not lost. END
BEGIN NOW Has something so important happened that you must come here about it? END
BEGIN NOW In a few minutes we should have been in the Rue d'Artois. END
BEGIN NOW Eh! END
BEGIN NOW does one think what one is doing after a catastrophe? END
BEGIN NOW It has turned my head. END
BEGIN NOW Your attorney has found out the state of things now, but it was bound to come out sooner or later. END
BEGIN NOW We shall want your long business experience; and I come to you like a drowning man who catches at a branch. END
BEGIN NOW When M. Derville found that Nucingen was throwing all sorts of difficulties in his way, he threatened him with proceedings, and told him plainly that he would soon obtain an order from the President of the Tribunal. END
BEGIN NOW So Nucingen came to my room this morning, and asked if I meant to ruin us both. END
BEGIN NOW I told him that I knew nothing whatever about it, that I had a fortune, and ought to be put into possession of my fortune, and that my attorney was acting for me in the matter; I said again that I knew absolutely nothing about it, and could not possibly go into the subject with him. END
BEGIN NOW Wasn't that what you told me to tell him? END
BEGIN NOW Yes, quite right, answered Goriot. END
BEGIN NOW Well, then, Delphine continued, he told me all about his affairs. END
BEGIN NOW He had just invested all his capital and mine in business speculations; they have only just been started, and very large sums of money are locked up. END
BEGIN NOW If I were to compel him to refund my dowry now, he would be forced to file his petition; but if I will wait a year, he undertakes, on his honor, to double or treble my fortune, by investing it in building land, and I shall be mistress at last of the whole of my property. END
BEGIN NOW He was speaking the truth, father dear; he frightened me! END
BEGIN NOW He asked my pardon for his conduct; he has given me my liberty; I am free to act as I please on condition that I leave him to carry on my business in my name. END
BEGIN NOW To prove his sincerity, he promised that M. Derville might inspect the accounts as often as I pleased, so that I might be assured that everything was being conducted properly. END
BEGIN NOW In short, he put himself in my power, bound hand and foot. END
BEGIN NOW He wishes the present arrangements as to the expenses of housekeeping to continue for two more years, and entreated me not to exceed my allowance. END
BEGIN NOW He showed me plainly that it was all that he could do to keep up appearances; he has broken with his opera dancer; he will be compelled to practise the most strict economy (in secret) if he is to bide his time with unshaken credit. END
BEGIN NOW I scolded, I did all I could to drive him to desperation, so as to find out more. END
BEGIN NOW He showed me his ledgers&mdash;he broke down and cried at last. END
BEGIN NOW I never saw a man in such a state. END
BEGIN NOW He lost his head completely, talked of killing himself, and raved till I felt quite sorry for him. END
BEGIN NOW Do you really believe that silly rubbish?\... cried her father. END
BEGIN NOW It was all got up for your benefit! END
BEGIN NOW I have had to do with Germans in the way of business, honest and straightforward they are pretty sure to be, but when with their simplicity and frankness they are sharpers and humbugs as well, they are the worst rogues of all. END
BEGIN NOW Your husband is taking advantage of you. END
BEGIN NOW As soon as pressure is brought to bear on him he shams dead; he means to be more the master under your name than in his own. END
BEGIN NOW He will take advantage of the position to secure himself against the risks of business. END
BEGIN NOW He is as sharp as he is treacherous; he is a bad lot! END
BEGIN NOW No, no; I am not going to leave my girls behind me without a penny when I go to Pere-Lachaise. END
BEGIN NOW I know something about business still. END
BEGIN NOW He has sunk his money in speculation, he says; very well then, there is something to show for it&mdash;bills, receipts, papers of some sort. END
BEGIN NOW Let him produce them, and come to an arrangement with you. END
BEGIN NOW We will choose the most promising of his speculations, take them over at our own risk, and have the securities transferred into your name; they shall represent the separate estate of Delphine Goriot, wife of the Baron de Nucingen. END
BEGIN NOW Does that fellow really take us for idiots? END
BEGIN NOW Does he imagine that I could stand the idea of your being without fortune, without bread, for forty-eight hours? END
BEGIN NOW I would not stand it a day&mdash;no, not a night, not a couple of hours! END
BEGIN NOW If there had been any foundation for the idea, I should never get over it. END
BEGIN NOW What! END
BEGIN NOW I have worked hard for forty years, carried sacks on my back, and sweated and pinched and saved all my life for you, my darlings, for you who made the toil and every burden borne for you seem light; and now, my fortune, my whole life, is to vanish in smoke! END
BEGIN NOW I should die raving mad if I believed a word of it. END
BEGIN NOW By all that's holiest in heaven and earth, we will have this cleared up at once; go through the books, have the whole business looked thoroughly into! END
BEGIN NOW I will not sleep, nor rest, nor eat until I have satisfied myself that all your fortune is in existence. END
BEGIN NOW Your money is settled upon you, God be thanked! END
BEGIN NOW and, luckily, your attorney, Maitre Derville, is an honest man. END
BEGIN NOW Good Lord! END
BEGIN NOW you shall have your snug little million, your fifty thousand francs a year, as long as you live, or I will raise a racket in Paris, I will so! END
BEGIN NOW If the Tribunals put upon us, I will appeal to the Chambers. END
BEGIN NOW If I knew that you were well and comfortably off as far as money is concerned, that thought would keep me easy in spite of bad health and troubles. END
BEGIN NOW Money? END
BEGIN NOW why, it is life! END
BEGIN NOW Money does everything. END
BEGIN NOW That great dolt of an Alsatian shall sing to another tune! END
BEGIN NOW Look here, Delphine, don't give way, don't make a concession of half a quarter of a farthing to that fathead, who has ground you down and made you miserable. END
BEGIN NOW If he can't do without you, we will give him a good cudgeling, and keep him in order. END
BEGIN NOW Great heavens! END
BEGIN NOW my brain is on fire; it is as if there were something redhot inside my head. END
BEGIN NOW My Delphine lying on straw! END
BEGIN NOW You! END
BEGIN NOW my Fifine! END
BEGIN NOW Good gracious! END
BEGIN NOW Where are my gloves? END
BEGIN NOW Come, let us go at once; I mean to see everything with my own eyes&mdash;books, cash, and correspondence, the whole business. END
BEGIN NOW I shall have no peace until I know for certain that your fortune is secure. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW father dear, be careful how you set about it! END
BEGIN NOW If there is the least hint of vengeance in the business, if you show yourself openly hostile, it will be all over with me. END
BEGIN NOW He knows whom he has to deal with; he thinks it quite natural that if you put the idea into my head, I should be uneasy about my money; but I swear to you that he has it in his own hands, and that he had meant to keep it. END
BEGIN NOW He is just the man to abscond with all the money and leave us in the lurch, the scoundrel! END
BEGIN NOW He knows quite well that I will not dishonor the name I bear by bringing him into a court of law. END
BEGIN NOW His position is strong and weak at the same time. END
BEGIN NOW If we drive him to despair, I am lost. END
BEGIN NOW Why, then, the man is a rogue? END
BEGIN NOW Well, yes, father, she said, flinging herself into a chair, I wanted to keep it from you to spare your feelings, and she burst into tears; I did not want you to know that you had married me to such a man as he is. END
BEGIN NOW He is just the same in private life&mdash;body and soul and conscience&mdash;the same through and through&mdash;hideous! END
BEGIN NOW I hate him; I despise him! END
BEGIN NOW Yes, after all that that despicable Nucingen has told me, I cannot respect him any longer. END
BEGIN NOW A man capable of mixing himself up in such affairs, and of talking about them to me as he did, without the slightest scruple,&mdash;it is because I have read him through and through that I am afraid of him. END
BEGIN NOW He, my husband, frankly proposed to give me my liberty, and do you know what that means? END
BEGIN NOW It means that if things turn out badly for him, I am to play into his hands, and be his stalking-horse. END
BEGIN NOW But there is law to be had! END
BEGIN NOW There is a Place de Greve for sons-in-law of that sort, cried her father; why, I would guillotine him myself if there was no headsman to do it. END
BEGIN NOW No, father, the law cannot touch him. END
BEGIN NOW Listen, this is what he says, stripped of all his circumlocutions&mdash;'Take your choice, you and no one else can be my accomplice; either everything is lost, you are ruined and have not a farthing, or you will let me carry this business through myself.' END
BEGIN NOW Is that plain speaking? END
BEGIN NOW He _must_ have my assistance. END
BEGIN NOW He is assured that his wife will deal fairly by him; he knows that I shall leave his money to him and be content with my own. END
BEGIN NOW It is an unholy and dishonest compact, and he holds out threats of ruin to compel me to consent to it. END
BEGIN NOW He is buying my conscience, and the price is liberty to be Eugene's wife in all but name. END
BEGIN NOW 'I connive at your errors, and you allow me to commit crimes and ruin poor families!' END
BEGIN NOW Is that sufficiently explicit? END
BEGIN NOW Do you know what he means by speculations? END
BEGIN NOW He buys up land in his own name, then he finds men of straw to run up houses upon it. END
BEGIN NOW These men make a bargain with a contractor to build the houses, paying them by bills at long dates; then in consideration of a small sum they leave my husband in possession of the houses, and finally slip through the fingers of the deluded contractors by going into bankruptcy. END
BEGIN NOW The name of the firm of Nucingen has been used to dazzle the poor contractors. END
BEGIN NOW I saw that. END
BEGIN NOW I noticed, too, that Nucingen had sent bills for large amounts to Amsterdam, London, Naples, and Vienna, in order to prove if necessary that large sums had been paid away by the firm. END
BEGIN NOW How could we get possession of those bills? END
BEGIN NOW Eugene heard a dull thud on the floor; Father Goriot must have fallen on his knees. END
BEGIN NOW Great heavens! END
BEGIN NOW what have I done to you? END
BEGIN NOW Bound my daughter to this scoundrel who does as he likes with her!&mdash;Oh! END
BEGIN NOW my child, my child! END
BEGIN NOW forgive me! END
BEGIN NOW cried the old man. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, if I am in the depths of despair, perhaps you are to blame, said Delphine. END
BEGIN NOW We have so little sense when we marry! END
BEGIN NOW What do we know of the world, of business, or men, or life? END
BEGIN NOW Our fathers should think for us! END
BEGIN NOW Father dear, I am not blaming you in the least, forgive me for what I said. END
BEGIN NOW This is all my own fault. END
BEGIN NOW Nay, do not cry, papa, she said, kissing him. END
BEGIN NOW Do not cry either, my little Delphine. END
BEGIN NOW Look up and let me kiss away the tears. END
BEGIN NOW There! END
BEGIN NOW I shall find my wits and unravel this skein of your husband's winding. END
BEGIN NOW No, let me do that; I shall be able to manage him. END
BEGIN NOW He is fond of me, well and good; I shall use my influence to make him invest my money as soon as possible in landed property in my own name. END
BEGIN NOW Very likely I could get him to buy back Nucingen in Alsace in my name; that has always been a pet idea of his. END
BEGIN NOW Still, come to-morrow and go through the books, and look into the business. END
BEGIN NOW M. Derville knows little of mercantile matters. END
BEGIN NOW No, not to-morrow though. END
BEGIN NOW I do not want to be upset. END
BEGIN NOW de Beauseant's ball will be the day after to-morrow, and I must keep quiet, so as to look my best and freshest, and do honor to my dear Eugene!... END
BEGIN NOW Come, let us see his room. END
BEGIN NOW But as she spoke a carriage stopped in the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve, and the sound of de Restaud's voice came from the staircase. END
BEGIN NOW Is my father in? END
BEGIN NOW she asked of Sylvie. END
BEGIN NOW This accident was luckily timed for Eugene, whose one idea had been to throw himself down on the bed and pretend to be asleep. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, father, have you heard about Anastasie? END
BEGIN NOW said Delphine, when she heard her sister speak. END
BEGIN NOW It looks as though some strange things had happened in that family. END
BEGIN NOW What sort of things? END
BEGIN NOW asked Goriot. END
BEGIN NOW This is like to be the death of me. END
BEGIN NOW My poor head will not stand a double misfortune. END
BEGIN NOW Good-morning, father, said the Countess from the threshold. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW Delphine, are you here? END
BEGIN NOW de Restaud seemed taken aback by her sister's presence. END
BEGIN NOW Good-morning, Nasie, said the Baroness. END
BEGIN NOW What is there so extraordinary in my being here? END
BEGIN NOW _I_ see our father every day. END
BEGIN NOW Since when? END
BEGIN NOW If you came yourself you would know. END
BEGIN NOW Don't tease, Delphine, said the Countess fretfully. END
BEGIN NOW I am very miserable, I am lost. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW my poor father, it is hopeless this time! END
BEGIN NOW What is it, Nasie? END
BEGIN NOW cried Goriot. END
BEGIN NOW Tell us all about it, child! END
BEGIN NOW How white she is! END
BEGIN NOW Quick, do something, Delphine; be kind to her, and I will love you even better, if that were possible. END
BEGIN NOW Poor Nasie! END
BEGIN NOW said de Nucingen, drawing her sister to a chair. END
BEGIN NOW We are the only two people in the world whose love is always sufficient to forgive you everything. END
BEGIN NOW Family affection is the surest, you see. END
BEGIN NOW The Countess inhaled the salts and revived. END
BEGIN NOW This will kill me! END
BEGIN NOW said their father. END
BEGIN NOW There, he went on, stirring the smouldering fire, come nearer, both of you. END
BEGIN NOW It is cold. END
BEGIN NOW What is it, Nasie? END
BEGIN NOW Be quick and tell me, this is enough to&mdash;- Well, then, my husband knows everything, said the Countess. END
BEGIN NOW Just imagine it; do you remember, father, that bill of Maxime's some time ago? END
BEGIN NOW Well, that was not the first. END
BEGIN NOW I had paid ever so many before that. END
BEGIN NOW About the beginning of January M. de Trailles seemed very much troubled. END
BEGIN NOW He said nothing to me; but it is so easy to read the hearts of those you love, a mere trifle is enough; and then you feel things instinctively. END
BEGIN NOW Indeed, he was more tender and affectionate than ever, and I was happier than I had ever been before. END
BEGIN NOW Poor Maxime! END
BEGIN NOW in himself he was really saying good-bye to me, so he has told me since; he meant to blow his brains out! END
BEGIN NOW At last I worried him so, and begged and implored so hard; for two hours I knelt at his knees and prayed and entreated, and at last he told me&mdash;that he owed a hundred thousand francs. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW papa! END
BEGIN NOW a hundred thousand francs! END
BEGIN NOW I was beside myself! END
BEGIN NOW You had not the money, I knew, I had eaten up all that you had&mdash;- No, said Goriot; I could not have got it for you unless I had stolen it. END
BEGIN NOW But I would have done that for you, Nasie! END
BEGIN NOW I will do it yet. END
BEGIN NOW The words came from him like a sob, a hoarse sound like the death rattle of a dying man; it seemed indeed like the agony of death when the father's love was powerless. END
BEGIN NOW There was a pause, and neither of the sisters spoke. END
BEGIN NOW It must have been selfishness indeed that could hear unmoved that cry of anguish that, like a pebble thrown over a precipice, revealed the depths of his despair. END
BEGIN NOW I found the money, father, by selling what was not mine to sell, and the Countess burst into tears. END
BEGIN NOW Delphine was touched; she laid her head on her sister's shoulder, and cried too. END
BEGIN NOW Then it is all true, she said. END
BEGIN NOW Anastasie bowed her head, de Nucingen flung her arms about her, kissed her tenderly, and held her sister to her heart. END
BEGIN NOW I shall always love you and never judge you, Nasie, she said. END
BEGIN NOW My angels, murmured Goriot faintly. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, why should it be trouble that draws you together? END
BEGIN NOW This warm and palpitating affection seemed to give the Countess courage. END
BEGIN NOW To save Maxime's life, she said, to save all my own happiness, I went to the money-lender you know of, a man of iron forged in hell-fire; nothing can melt him; I took all the family diamonds that M. de Restaud is so proud of&mdash;his and mine too&mdash;and sold them to that M. Gobseck. END
BEGIN NOW _Sold them!_ Do you understand? END
BEGIN NOW I saved Maxime, but I am lost. END
BEGIN NOW Restaud found it all out. END
BEGIN NOW How? END
BEGIN NOW Who told him? END
BEGIN NOW I will kill him, cried Goriot. END
BEGIN NOW Yesterday he sent to tell me to come to his room. END
BEGIN NOW I went.\... 'Anastasie,' he said in a voice&mdash;oh! END
BEGIN NOW such a voice; that was enough, it told me everything&mdash;'where are your diamonds? END
BEGIN NOW '&mdash;'In my room&mdash;-'&mdash;'No,' he said, looking straight at me, 'there they are on that chest of drawers&mdash;-' and he lifted his handkerchief and showed me the casket. END
BEGIN NOW 'Do you know where they came from?' END
BEGIN NOW he said. END
BEGIN NOW I fell at his feet.... END
BEGIN NOW I cried; I besought him to tell me the death he wished to see me die. END
BEGIN NOW You said that! END
BEGIN NOW cried Goriot. END
BEGIN NOW By God in heaven, whoever lays a hand on either of you so long as I am alive may reckon on being roasted by slow fires! END
BEGIN NOW Yes, I will cut him in pieces like... Goriot stopped; the words died away in his throat. END
BEGIN NOW And then, dear, he asked something worse than death of me. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW heaven preserve all other women from hearing such words as I heard then! END
BEGIN NOW I will murder that man, said Goriot quietly. END
BEGIN NOW But he has only one life, and he deserves to die twice.&mdash;And then, what next? END
BEGIN NOW he added, looking at Anastasie. END
BEGIN NOW Then, the Countess resumed, there was a pause, and he looked at me. END
BEGIN NOW 'Anastasie,' he said, 'I will bury this in silence; there shall be no separation; there are the children. END
BEGIN NOW I will not kill M. de Trailles. END
BEGIN NOW I might miss him if we fought, and as for other ways of getting rid of him, I should come into collision with the law. END
BEGIN NOW If I killed him in your arms, it would bring dishonor on _those_ children. END
BEGIN NOW But if you do not want to see your children perish, nor their father nor me, you must first of all submit to two conditions. END
BEGIN NOW Answer me. END
BEGIN NOW Have I a child of my own?' END
BEGIN NOW I answered, 'Yes,'&mdash;'Which? END
BEGIN NOW '&mdash;'Ernest, our eldest boy. END
BEGIN NOW '&mdash;'Very well,' he said, 'and now swear to obey me in this particular from this time forward.' END
BEGIN NOW I swore. END
BEGIN NOW 'You will make over your property to me when I require you to do so.' END
BEGIN NOW Do nothing of the kind! END
BEGIN NOW cried Goriot. END
BEGIN NOW Aha! END
BEGIN NOW M. de Restaud, you could not make your wife happy; she has looked for happiness and found it elsewhere, and you make her suffer for your own ineptitude? END
BEGIN NOW He will have to reckon with me. END
BEGIN NOW Make yourself easy, Nasie. END
BEGIN NOW Aha! END
BEGIN NOW he cares about his heir! END
BEGIN NOW Good, very good. END
BEGIN NOW I will get hold of the boy; isn't he my grandson? END
BEGIN NOW What the blazes! END
BEGIN NOW I can surely go to see the brat! END
BEGIN NOW I will stow him away somewhere; I will take care of him, you may be quite easy. END
BEGIN NOW I will bring Restaud to terms, the monster! END
BEGIN NOW I shall say to him, 'A word or two with you! END
BEGIN NOW If you want your son back again, give my daughter her property, and leave her to do as she pleases.' END
BEGIN NOW Father! END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW I am your father, Nasie, a father indeed! END
BEGIN NOW That rogue of a great lord had better not ill-treat my daughter. END
BEGIN NOW _Tonnerre!_ What is it in my veins? END
BEGIN NOW There is the blood of a tiger in me; I could tear those two men to pieces! END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW children, children! END
BEGIN NOW so this is what your lives are! END
BEGIN NOW Why, it is death!... END
BEGIN NOW What will become of you when I shall be here no longer? END
BEGIN NOW Fathers ought to live as long as their children. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW Lord God in heaven! END
BEGIN NOW how ill Thy world is ordered! END
BEGIN NOW Thou hast a Son, if what they tell us is true, and yet Thou leavest us to suffer so through our children. END
BEGIN NOW My darlings, my darlings! END
BEGIN NOW to think that trouble only should bring you to me, that I should only see you with tears on your faces! END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW yes, yes, you love me, I see that you love me. END
BEGIN NOW Come to me and pour out your griefs to me; my heart is large enough to hold them all. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW you might rend my heart in pieces, and every fragment would make a father's heart. END
BEGIN NOW If only I could bear all your sorrows for you!\... Ah! END
BEGIN NOW you were so happy when you were little and still with me.... We have never been happy since, said Delphine. END
BEGIN NOW Where are the old days when we slid down the sacks in the great granary? END
BEGIN NOW That is not all, father, said Anastasie in Goriot's ear. END
BEGIN NOW The old man gave a startled shudder. END
BEGIN NOW The diamonds only sold for a hundred thousand francs. END
BEGIN NOW Maxime is hard pressed. END
BEGIN NOW There are twelve thousand francs still to pay. END
BEGIN NOW He has given me his word that he will be steady and give up play in future. END
BEGIN NOW His love is all that I have left in the world. END
BEGIN NOW I have paid such a fearful price for it that I should die if I lose him now. END
BEGIN NOW I have sacrificed my fortune, my honor, my peace of mind, and my children for him. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW do something, so that at the least Maxime may be at large and live undisgraced in the world, where he will assuredly make a career for himself. END
BEGIN NOW Something more than my happiness is at stake; the children have nothing, and if he is sent to Sainte-Pelagie all his prospects will be ruined. END
BEGIN NOW I haven't the money, Nasie. END
BEGIN NOW I have _nothing_&mdash;nothing left. END
BEGIN NOW This is the end of everything. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, the world is crumbling into ruin, I am sure. END
BEGIN NOW Fly! END
BEGIN NOW Save yourselves! END
BEGIN NOW Ah!&mdash;I have still my silver buckles left, and half-a-dozen silver spoons and forks, the first I ever had in my life. END
BEGIN NOW But I have nothing else except my life annuity, twelve hundred francs... Then what has become of your money in the funds? END
BEGIN NOW I sold out, and only kept a trifle for my wants. END
BEGIN NOW I wanted twelve thousand francs to furnish some rooms for Delphine. END
BEGIN NOW In your own house? END
BEGIN NOW asked de Restaud, looking at her sister. END
BEGIN NOW What does it matter where they were? END
BEGIN NOW asked Goriot. END
BEGIN NOW The money is spent now. END
BEGIN NOW I see how it is, said the Countess. END
BEGIN NOW Rooms for M. de Rastignac. END
BEGIN NOW Poor Delphine, take warning by me! END
BEGIN NOW M. de Rastignac is incapable of ruining the woman he loves, dear. END
BEGIN NOW Thanks! END
BEGIN NOW Delphine. END
BEGIN NOW I thought you would have been kinder to me in my troubles, but you never did love me. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, yes, she loves you, Nasie, cried Goriot; she was saying so only just now. END
BEGIN NOW We were talking about you, and she insisted that you were beautiful, and that she herself was only pretty! END
BEGIN NOW Pretty! END
BEGIN NOW said the Countess. END
BEGIN NOW She is as hard as a marble statue. END
BEGIN NOW And if I am? END
BEGIN NOW cried Delphine, flushing up, how have you treated me? END
BEGIN NOW You would not recognize me; you closed the doors of every house against me; you have never let an opportunity of mortifying me slip by. END
BEGIN NOW And when did I come, as you were always doing, to drain our poor father, a thousand francs at a time, till he is left as you see him now? END
BEGIN NOW That is all your doing, sister! END
BEGIN NOW I myself have seen my father as often as I could. END
BEGIN NOW I have not turned him out of the house, and then come and fawned upon him when I wanted money. END
BEGIN NOW I did not so much as know that he had spent those twelve thousand francs on me. END
BEGIN NOW I am economical, as you know; and when papa has made me presents, it has never been because I came and begged for them. END
BEGIN NOW You were better off than I. M. de Marsay was rich, as you have reason to know. END
BEGIN NOW You always were as slippery as gold. END
BEGIN NOW Good-bye; I have neither sister nor&mdash;- Oh! END
BEGIN NOW hush, hush, Nasie! END
BEGIN NOW cried her father. END
BEGIN NOW Nobody else would repeat what everybody has ceased to believe. END
BEGIN NOW You are an unnatural sister! END
BEGIN NOW cried Delphine. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, children, children! END
BEGIN NOW hush! END
BEGIN NOW hush! END
BEGIN NOW or I will kill myself before your eyes. END
BEGIN NOW There, Nasie, I forgive you, said de Nucingen; you are very unhappy. END
BEGIN NOW But I am kinder than you are. END
BEGIN NOW How could you say _that_ just when I was ready to do anything in the world to help you, even to be reconciled with my husband, which for my own sake I&mdash;-Oh! END
BEGIN NOW it is just like you; you have behaved cruelly to me all through these nine years. END
BEGIN NOW Children, children, kiss each other! END
BEGIN NOW cried the father. END
BEGIN NOW You are angels, both of you. END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW Let me alone, cried the Countess shaking off the hand that her father had laid on her arm. END
BEGIN NOW She is more merciless than my husband. END
BEGIN NOW Any one might think she was a model of all the virtues herself! END
BEGIN NOW I would rather have people think that I owed money to M. de Marsay than own that M. de Trailles had cost me more than two hundred thousand francs, retorted de Nucingen. END
BEGIN NOW _Delphine!_ cried the Countess, stepping towards her sister. END
BEGIN NOW I shall tell you the truth about yourself if you begin to slander me, said the Baroness coldly. END
BEGIN NOW Delphine! END
BEGIN NOW you are a &mdash;- Father Goriot sprang between them, grasped the Countess' hand, and laid his own over her mouth. END
BEGIN NOW Good heavens, father! END
BEGIN NOW What have you been handling this morning? END
BEGIN NOW said Anastasie. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW well, yes, I ought not to have touched you, said the poor father, wiping his hands on his trousers, but I have been packing up my things; I did not know that you were coming to see me. END
BEGIN NOW He was glad that he had drawn down her wrath upon himself. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW he sighed, as he sat down, you children have broken my heart between you. END
BEGIN NOW This is killing me. END
BEGIN NOW My head feels as if it were on fire. END
BEGIN NOW Be good to each other and love each other! END
BEGIN NOW This will be the death of me! END
BEGIN NOW Delphine! END
BEGIN NOW Nasie! END
BEGIN NOW come, be sensible; you are both in the wrong. END
BEGIN NOW Come, Dedel, he added, looking through his tears at the Baroness, she must have twelve thousand francs, you see; let us see if we can find them for her. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, my girls, do not look at each other like that! END
BEGIN NOW and he sank on his knees beside Delphine. END
BEGIN NOW Ask her to forgive you&mdash;just to please me, he said in her ear. END
BEGIN NOW She is more miserable than you are. END
BEGIN NOW Come now, Dedel. END
BEGIN NOW Poor Nasie! END
BEGIN NOW said Delphine, alarmed at the wild extravagant grief in her father's face, I was in the wrong, kiss me&mdash;- Ah! END
BEGIN NOW that is like balm to my heart, cried Father Goriot. END
BEGIN NOW But how are we to find twelve thousand francs? END
BEGIN NOW I might offer myself as a substitute in the army&mdash;- Oh! END
BEGIN NOW father dear! END
BEGIN NOW they both cried, flinging their arms about him. END
BEGIN NOW No, no! END
BEGIN NOW God reward you for the thought. END
BEGIN NOW We are not worth it, are we, Nasie? END
BEGIN NOW asked Delphine. END
BEGIN NOW And besides, father dear, it would only be a drop in the bucket, observed the Countess. END
BEGIN NOW But is flesh and blood worth nothing? END
BEGIN NOW cried the old man in his despair. END
BEGIN NOW I would give body and soul to save you, Nasie. END
BEGIN NOW I would do a murder for the man who would rescue you. END
BEGIN NOW I would do, as Vautrin did, go to the hulks, go&mdash;- he stopped as if struck by a thunderbolt, and put both hands to his head. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing left! END
BEGIN NOW he cried, tearing his hair. END
BEGIN NOW If I only knew of a way to steal money, but it is so hard to do it, and then you can't set to work by yourself, and it takes time to rob a bank. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, it is time I was dead; there is nothing left me to do but to die. END
BEGIN NOW I am no good in the world; I am no longer a father! END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW She has come to me in her extremity, and, wretch that I am, I have nothing to give her. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW you put your money into a life annuity, old scoundrel; and had you not daughters? END
BEGIN NOW You did not love them. END
BEGIN NOW Die, die in a ditch, like the dog that you are! END
BEGIN NOW Yes, I am worse than a dog; a beast would not have done as I have done! END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW my head... it throbs as if it would burst. END
BEGIN NOW Papa! END
BEGIN NOW cried both the young women at once, do, pray, be reasonable! END
BEGIN NOW and they clung to him to prevent him from dashing his head against the wall. END
BEGIN NOW There was a sound of sobbing. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene, greatly alarmed, took the bill that bore Vautrin's signature, saw that the stamp would suffice for a larger sum, altered the figures, made it into a regular bill for twelve thousand francs, payable to Goriot's order, and went to his neighbor's room. END
BEGIN NOW Here is the money, madame, he said, handing the piece of paper to her. END
BEGIN NOW I was asleep; your conversation awoke me, and by this means I learned all that I owed to M. Goriot. END
BEGIN NOW This bill can be discounted, and I shall meet it punctually at the due date. END
BEGIN NOW The Countess stood motionless and speechless, but she held the bill in her fingers. END
BEGIN NOW Delphine, she said, with a white face, and her whole frame quivering with indignation, anger, and rage, I forgave you everything; God is my witness that I forgave you, but I cannot forgive this! END
BEGIN NOW So this gentleman was there all the time, and you knew it! END
BEGIN NOW Your petty spite has let you to wreak your vengeance on me by betraying my secrets, my life, my children's lives, my shame, my honor! END
BEGIN NOW There, you are nothing to me any longer. END
BEGIN NOW I hate you. END
BEGIN NOW I will do all that I can to injure you. END
BEGIN NOW I will... Anger paralyzed her; the words died in her dry parched throat. END
BEGIN NOW Why, he is my son, my child; he is your brother, your preserver! END
BEGIN NOW cried Goriot. END
BEGIN NOW Kiss his hand, Nasie! END
BEGIN NOW Stay, I will embrace him myself, he said, straining Eugene to his breast in a frenzied clasp. END
BEGIN NOW Oh my boy! END
BEGIN NOW I will be more than a father to you; if I had God's power, I would fling worlds at your feet. END
BEGIN NOW Why don't you kiss him, Nasie? END
BEGIN NOW He is not a man, but an angel, a angel out of heaven. END
BEGIN NOW Never mind her, father; she is mad just now. END
BEGIN NOW Mad! END
BEGIN NOW am I? END
BEGIN NOW And what are you? END
BEGIN NOW cried de Restaud. END
BEGIN NOW Children, children, I shall die if you go on like this, cried the old man, and he staggered and fell on the bed as if a bullet had struck him.&mdash; They are killing me between them, he said to himself. END
BEGIN NOW The Countess fixed her eyes on Eugene, who stood stock still; all his faculties were numbed by this violent scene. END
BEGIN NOW Sir?... END
BEGIN NOW she said, doubt and inquiry in her face, tone, and bearing; she took no notice now of her father nor of Delphine, who was hastily unfastening his waistcoat. END
BEGIN NOW Madame, said Eugene, answering the question before it was asked, I will meet the bill, and keep silence about it. END
BEGIN NOW You have killed our father, Nasie! END
BEGIN NOW said Delphine, pointing to Goriot, who lay unconscious on the bed. END
BEGIN NOW The Countess fled. END
BEGIN NOW I freely forgive her, said the old man, opening his eyes; her position is horrible; it would turn an older head than hers. END
BEGIN NOW Comfort Nasie, and be nice to her, Delphine; promise it to your poor father before he dies, he asked, holding Delphine's hand in a convulsive clasp. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW what ails you, father? END
BEGIN NOW she cried in real alarm. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing, nothing, said Goriot; it will go off. END
BEGIN NOW There is something heavy pressing on my forehead, a little headache.... Ah! END
BEGIN NOW poor Nasie, what a life lies before her! END
BEGIN NOW Just as he spoke, the Countess came back again and flung herself on her knees before him. END
BEGIN NOW Forgive me! END
BEGIN NOW she cried. END
BEGIN NOW Come, said her father, you are hurting me still more. END
BEGIN NOW Monsieur, the Countess said, turning to Rastignac, misery made me unjust to you. END
BEGIN NOW You will be a brother to me, will you not? END
BEGIN NOW and she held out her hand. END
BEGIN NOW Her eyes were full of tears as she spoke. END
BEGIN NOW Nasie, cried Delphine, flinging her arms round her sister, my little Nasie, let us forget and forgive. END
BEGIN NOW No, no, cried Nasie; I shall never forget! END
BEGIN NOW Dear angels, cried Goriot, it is as if a dark curtain over my eyes had been raised; your voices have called me back to life. END
BEGIN NOW Kiss each other once more. END
BEGIN NOW Well, now, Nasie, that bill will save you, won't it? END
BEGIN NOW I hope so. END
BEGIN NOW I say, papa, will you write your name on it? END
BEGIN NOW There! END
BEGIN NOW how stupid of me to forget that! END
BEGIN NOW But I am not feeling at all well, Nasie, so you must not remember it against me. END
BEGIN NOW Send and let me know as soon as you are out of your strait. END
BEGIN NOW No, I will go to you. END
BEGIN NOW No, after all, I will not go; I might meet your husband, and I should kill him on the spot. END
BEGIN NOW And as for signing away your property, I shall have a word to say about that. END
BEGIN NOW Quick, my child, and keep Maxime in order in future. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene was too bewildered to speak. END
BEGIN NOW Poor Anastasie, she always had a violent temper, said de Nucingen, but she has a good heart. END
BEGIN NOW She came back for the endorsement, said Eugene in Delphine's ear. END
BEGIN NOW Do you think so? END
BEGIN NOW I only wish I could think otherwise. END
BEGIN NOW Do not trust her, he answered, raising his eyes as if he confided to heaven the thoughts that he did not venture to express. END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW She is always acting a part to some extent. END
BEGIN NOW How do you feel now, dear Father Goriot? END
BEGIN NOW asked Rastignac. END
BEGIN NOW I should like to go to sleep, he replied. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene helped him to bed, and Delphine sat by the bedside, holding his hand until he fell asleep. END
BEGIN NOW Then she went. END
BEGIN NOW This evening at the Italiens, she said to Eugene, and you can let me know how he is. END
BEGIN NOW To-morrow you will leave this place, monsieur. END
BEGIN NOW Let us go into your room.&mdash;Oh! END
BEGIN NOW how frightful! END
BEGIN NOW she cried on the threshold. END
BEGIN NOW Why, you are even worse lodged than our father. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene, you have behaved well. END
BEGIN NOW I would love you more if that were possible; but, dear boy, if you are to succeed in life, you must not begin by flinging twelve thousand francs out of the windows like that. END
BEGIN NOW The Comte de Trailles is a confirmed gambler. END
BEGIN NOW My sister shuts her eyes to it. END
BEGIN NOW He would have made the twelve thousand francs in the same way that he wins and loses heaps of gold. END
BEGIN NOW A groan from the next room brought them back to Goriot's bedside; to all appearances he was asleep, but the two lovers caught the words, They are not happy! END
BEGIN NOW Whether he was awake or sleeping, the tone in which they were spoken went to his daughter's heart. END
BEGIN NOW She stole up to the pallet-bed on which her father lay, and kissed his forehead. END
BEGIN NOW He opened his eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW Delphine! END
BEGIN NOW he said. END
BEGIN NOW How are you now? END
BEGIN NOW she asked. END
BEGIN NOW Quite comfortable. END
BEGIN NOW Do not worry about me; I shall get up presently. END
BEGIN NOW Don't stay with me, children; go, go and be happy. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene went back with Delphine as far as her door; but he was not easy about Goriot, and would not stay to dinner, as she proposed. END
BEGIN NOW He wanted to be back at the Maison Vauquer. END
BEGIN NOW Father Goriot had left his room, and was just sitting down to dinner as he came in. END
BEGIN NOW Bianchon had placed himself where he could watch the old man carefully; and when the old vermicelli maker took up his square of bread and smelled it to find out the quality of the flour, the medical student, studying him closely, saw that the action was purely mechanical, and shook his head. END
BEGIN NOW Just come and sit over here, hospitaller of Cochin, said Eugene. END
BEGIN NOW Bianchon went the more willingly because his change of place brought him next to the old lodger. END
BEGIN NOW What is wrong with him? END
BEGIN NOW asked Rastignac. END
BEGIN NOW It is all up with him, or I am much mistaken! END
BEGIN NOW Something very extraordinary must have taken place; he looks to me as if he were in imminent danger of serous apoplexy. END
BEGIN NOW The lower part of his face is composed enough, but the upper part is drawn and distorted. END
BEGIN NOW Then there is that peculiar look about the eyes that indicates an effusion of serum in the brain; they look as though they were covered with a film of fine dust, do you notice? END
BEGIN NOW I shall know more about it by to-morrow morning. END
BEGIN NOW Is there any cure for it? END
BEGIN NOW None. END
BEGIN NOW It might be possible to stave death off for a time if a way could be found of setting up a reaction in the lower extremities; but if the symptoms do not abate by to-morrow evening, it will be all over with him, poor old fellow! END
BEGIN NOW Do you know what has happened to bring this on? END
BEGIN NOW There must have been some violent shock, and his mind has given way. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, there was, said Rastignac, remembering how the two daughters had struck blow on blow at their father's heart. END
BEGIN NOW But Delphine at any rate loves her father, he said to himself. END
BEGIN NOW That evening at the opera Rastignac chose his words carefully, lest he should give de Nucingen needless alarm. END
BEGIN NOW Do not be anxious about him, she said, however, as soon as Eugene began, our father has really a strong constitution, but this morning we gave him a shock. END
BEGIN NOW Our whole fortunes were in peril, so the thing was serious, you see. END
BEGIN NOW I could not live if your affection did not make me insensible to troubles that I should once have thought too hard to bear. END
BEGIN NOW At this moment I have but one fear left, but one misery to dread&mdash;to lose the love that has made me feel glad to live. END
BEGIN NOW Everything else is as nothing to me compared with our love; I care for nothing else, for you are all the world to me. END
BEGIN NOW If I feel glad to be rich, it is for your sake. END
BEGIN NOW To my shame be it said, I think of my lover before my father. END
BEGIN NOW Do you ask why? END
BEGIN NOW I cannot tell you, but all my life is in you. END
BEGIN NOW My father gave me a heart, but you have taught it to beat. END
BEGIN NOW The whole world may condemn me; what does it matter if I stand acquitted in your eyes, for you have no right to think ill of me for the faults which a tyrannous love has forced me to commit for you! END
BEGIN NOW Do you think me an unnatural daughter? END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW no, no one could help loving such a dear kind father as ours. END
BEGIN NOW But how could I hide the inevitable consequences of our miserable marriages from him? END
BEGIN NOW Why did he allow us to marry when we did? END
BEGIN NOW Was it not his duty to think for us and foresee for us? END
BEGIN NOW To-day I know he suffers as much as we do, but how can it be helped? END
BEGIN NOW And as for comforting him, we could not comfort him in the least. END
BEGIN NOW Our resignation would give him more pain and hurt him far more than complaints and upbraidings. END
BEGIN NOW There are times in life when everything turns to bitterness. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene was silent, the artless and sincere outpouring made an impression on him. END
BEGIN NOW Parisian women are often false, intoxicated with vanity, selfish and self-absorbed, frivolous and shallow; yet of all women, when they love, they sacrifice their personal feelings to their passion; they rise but so much the higher for all the pettiness overcome in their nature, and become sublime. END
BEGIN NOW Then Eugene was struck by the profound discernment and insight displayed by this woman in judging of natural affection, when a privileged affection had separated and set her at a distance apart. END
BEGIN NOW de Nucingen was piqued by the silence, What are you thinking about? END
BEGIN NOW she asked. END
BEGIN NOW I am thinking about what you said just now. END
BEGIN NOW Hitherto I have always felt sure that I cared far more for you than you did for me. END
BEGIN NOW She smiled, and would not give way to the happiness she felt, lest their talk should exceed the conventional limits of propriety. END
BEGIN NOW She had never heard the vibrating tones of a sincere and youthful love; a few more words, and she feared for her self-control. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene, she said, changing the conversation, I wonder whether you know what has been happening? END
BEGIN NOW All Paris will go to de Beauseant's to-morrow. END
BEGIN NOW The Rochefides and the Marquis d'Ajuda have agreed to keep the matter a profound secret, but to-morrow the king will sign the marriage-contract, and your poor cousin the Vicomtesse knows nothing of it as yet. END
BEGIN NOW She cannot put off her ball, and the Marquis will not be there. END
BEGIN NOW People are wondering what will happen? END
BEGIN NOW The world laughs at baseness and connives at it. END
BEGIN NOW But this will kill de Beauseant. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, no, said Delphine, smiling, you do not know that kind of woman. END
BEGIN NOW Why, all Paris will be there, and so shall I; I ought to go there for your sake. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps, after all, it is one of those absurd reports that people set in circulation here. END
BEGIN NOW We shall know the truth to-morrow. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene did not return to the Maison Vauquer. END
BEGIN NOW He could not forego the pleasure of occupying his new rooms in the Rue d'Artois. END
BEGIN NOW Yesterday evening he had been obliged to leave Delphine soon after midnight, but that night it was Delphine who stayed with him until two o'clock in the morning. END
BEGIN NOW He rose late, and waited for de Nucingen, who came about noon to breakfast with him. END
BEGIN NOW Youth snatches eagerly at these rosy moments of happiness, and Eugene had almost forgotten Goriot's existence. END
BEGIN NOW The pretty things that surrounded him were growing familiar; this domestication in itself was one long festival for him, and de Nucingen was there to glorify it all by her presence. END
BEGIN NOW It was four o'clock before they thought of Goriot, and of how he had looked forward to the new life in that house. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene said that the old man ought to be moved at once, lest he should grow too ill to move. END
BEGIN NOW He left Delphine and hurried back to the lodging-house. END
BEGIN NOW Neither Father Goriot nor young Bianchon was in the dining-room with the others. END
BEGIN NOW Aha! END
BEGIN NOW said the painter as Eugene came in, Father Goriot has broken down at last. END
BEGIN NOW Bianchon is upstairs with him. END
BEGIN NOW One of his daughters&mdash;the Comtesse de Restaurama&mdash;came to see the old gentleman, and he would get up and go out, and made himself worse. END
BEGIN NOW Society is about to lose one of its brightest ornaments. END
BEGIN NOW Rastignac sprang to the staircase. END
BEGIN NOW Hey! END
BEGIN NOW Monsieur Eugene! END
BEGIN NOW Monsieur Eugene, the mistress is calling you, shouted Sylvie. END
BEGIN NOW It is this, sir, said the widow. END
BEGIN NOW You and M. Goriot should by rights have moved out on the th of February. END
BEGIN NOW That was three days ago; to-day is the th, I ought really to be paid a month in advance; but if you will engage to pay for both, I shall be quite satisfied. END
BEGIN NOW Why can't you trust him? END
BEGIN NOW Trust him, indeed! END
BEGIN NOW If the old gentleman went off his head and died, those daughters of his would not pay me a farthing, and his things won't fetch ten francs. END
BEGIN NOW This morning he went out with all the spoons and forks he has left, I don't know why. END
BEGIN NOW He had got himself up to look quite young, and&mdash;Lord, forgive me&mdash;but I thought he had rouge on his cheeks; he looked quite young again. END
BEGIN NOW I will be responsible, said Eugene, shuddering with horror, for he foresaw the end. END
BEGIN NOW He climbed the stairs and reached Father Goriot's room. END
BEGIN NOW The old man was tossing on his bed. END
BEGIN NOW Bianchon was with him. END
BEGIN NOW Good-evening, father, said Eugene. END
BEGIN NOW The old man turned his glassy eyes on him, smiled gently, and said: How is _she_? END
BEGIN NOW She is quite well. END
BEGIN NOW But how are you? END
BEGIN NOW There is nothing much the matter. END
BEGIN NOW Don't tire him, said Bianchon, drawing Eugene into a corner of the room. END
BEGIN NOW Well? END
BEGIN NOW asked Rastignac. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing but a miracle can save him now. END
BEGIN NOW Serous congestion has set in; I have put on mustard plasters, and luckily he can feel them, they are acting. END
BEGIN NOW Is it possible to move him? END
BEGIN NOW Quite out of the question. END
BEGIN NOW He must stay where he is, and be kept as quiet as possible&mdash;- Dear Bianchon, said Eugene, we will nurse him between us. END
BEGIN NOW I have had the head physician round from my hospital to see him. END
BEGIN NOW And what did he say? END
BEGIN NOW He will give no opinion till to-morrow evening. END
BEGIN NOW He promised to look in again at the end of the day. END
BEGIN NOW Unluckily, the preposterous creature must needs go and do something foolish this morning; he will not say what it was. END
BEGIN NOW He is as obstinate as a mule. END
BEGIN NOW As soon as I begin to talk to him he pretends not to hear, and lies as if he were asleep instead of answering, or if he opens his eyes he begins to groan. END
BEGIN NOW Some time this morning he went out on foot in the streets, nobody knows where he went, and he took everything that he had of any value with him. END
BEGIN NOW He has been driving some confounded bargain, and it has been too much for his strength. END
BEGIN NOW One of his daughters has been here. END
BEGIN NOW Was it the Countess? END
BEGIN NOW asked Eugene. END
BEGIN NOW A tall, dark-haired woman, with large bright eyes, slender figure, and little feet? END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Leave him to me for a bit, said Rastignac. END
BEGIN NOW I will make him confess; he will tell me all about it. END
BEGIN NOW And meanwhile I will get my dinner. END
BEGIN NOW But try not to excite him; there is still some hope left. END
BEGIN NOW All right. END
BEGIN NOW How they will enjoy themselves to-morrow, said Father Goriot when they were alone. END
BEGIN NOW They are going to a grand ball. END
BEGIN NOW What were you doing this morning, papa, to make yourself so poorly this evening that you have to stop in bed? END
BEGIN NOW Nothing. END
BEGIN NOW Did not Anastasie come to see you? END
BEGIN NOW demanded Rastignac. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, said Father Goriot. END
BEGIN NOW Well, then, don't keep anything from me. END
BEGIN NOW What more did she want of you? END
BEGIN NOW Oh, she was very miserable, he answered, gathering up all his strength to speak. END
BEGIN NOW It was this way, my boy. END
BEGIN NOW Since that affair of the diamonds, Nasie has not had a penny of her own. END
BEGIN NOW For this ball she had ordered a golden gown like a setting for a jewel. END
BEGIN NOW Her mantuamaker, a woman without a conscience, would not give her credit, so Nasie's waiting-woman advanced a thousand francs on account. END
BEGIN NOW Poor Nasie! END
BEGIN NOW reduced to such shifts! END
BEGIN NOW It cut me to the heart to think of it! END
BEGIN NOW But when Nasie's maid saw how things were between her master and mistress, she was afraid of losing her money, and came to an understanding with the dressmaker, and the woman refuses to send the ball-dress until the money is paid. END
BEGIN NOW The gown is ready, and the ball is to-morrow night! END
BEGIN NOW Nasie was in despair. END
BEGIN NOW She wanted to borrow my forks and spoons to pawn them. END
BEGIN NOW Her husband is determined that she shall go and wear the diamonds, so as to contradict the stories that are told all over Paris. END
BEGIN NOW How can she go to that heartless scoundrel and say, 'I owe a thousand francs to my dressmaker; pay her for me!' END
BEGIN NOW She cannot. END
BEGIN NOW I saw that myself. END
BEGIN NOW Delphine will be there too in a superb toilette, and Anastasie ought not to be outshone by her younger sister. END
BEGIN NOW And then&mdash;she was drowned in tears, poor girl! END
BEGIN NOW I felt so humbled yesterday when I had not the twelve thousand francs, that I would have given the rest of my miserable life to wipe out that wrong. END
BEGIN NOW You see, I could have borne anything once, but latterly this want of money has broken my heart. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW I did not do it by halves; I titivated myself up a bit, and went out and sold my spoons and forks and buckles for six hundred francs; then I went to old Daddy Gobseck, and sold a year's interest on my annuity for four hundred francs down. END
BEGIN NOW Pshaw! END
BEGIN NOW I can live on dry bread, as I did when I was a young man; if I have done it before, I can do it again. END
BEGIN NOW My Nasie shall have one happy evening, at any rate. END
BEGIN NOW She shall be smart. END
BEGIN NOW The banknote for a thousand francs is under my pillow; it warms me to have it lying there under my head, for it is going to make my poor Nasie happy. END
BEGIN NOW She can turn that bad girl Victoire out of the house. END
BEGIN NOW A servant that cannot trust her mistress, did any one ever hear the like! END
BEGIN NOW I shall be quite well to-morrow. END
BEGIN NOW Nasie is coming at ten o'clock. END
BEGIN NOW They must not think that I am ill, or they will not go to the ball; they will stop and take care of me. END
BEGIN NOW To-morrow Nasie will come and hold me in her arms as if I were one of her children; her kisses will make me well again. END
BEGIN NOW After all, I might have spent the thousand francs on physic; I would far rather give them to my little Nasie, who can charm all the pain away. END
BEGIN NOW At any rate, I am some comfort to her in her misery; and that makes up for my unkindness in buying an annuity. END
BEGIN NOW She is in the depths, and I cannot draw her out of them now. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW I will go into business again, I will buy wheat in Odessa; out there, wheat fetches a quarter of the price it sells for here. END
BEGIN NOW There is a law against the importation of grain, but the good folk who made the law forgot to prohibit the introduction of wheat products and food stuffs made from corn. END
BEGIN NOW Hey! END
BEGIN NOW hey!... END
BEGIN NOW That struck me this morning. END
BEGIN NOW There is a fine trade to be done in starch. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene, watching the old man's face, thought that his friend was light-headed. END
BEGIN NOW Come, he said, do not talk any more, you must rest&mdash;- Just then Bianchon came up, and Eugene went down to dinner. END
BEGIN NOW The two students sat up with him that night, relieving each other in turn. END
BEGIN NOW Bianchon brought up his medical books and studied; Eugene wrote letters home to his mother and sisters. END
BEGIN NOW Next morning Bianchon thought the symptoms more hopeful, but the patient's condition demanded continual attention, which the two students alone were willing to give&mdash;a task impossible to describe in the squeamish phraseology of the epoch. END
BEGIN NOW Leeches must be applied to the wasted body, the poultices and hot foot-baths, and other details of the treatment required the physical strength and devotion of the two young men. END
BEGIN NOW de Restaud did not come; but she sent a messenger for the money. END
BEGIN NOW I expected she would come herself; but it would have been a pity for her to come, she would have been anxious about me, said the father, and to all appearances he was well content. END
BEGIN NOW At seven o'clock that evening Therese came with a letter from Delphine. END
BEGIN NOW What are you doing, dear friend? END
BEGIN NOW I have been loved for a very little while, and I am neglected already? END
BEGIN NOW In the confidences of heart and heart, I have learned to know your soul&mdash;you are too noble not to be faithful for ever, for you know that love with all its infinite subtle changes of feeling is never the same. END
BEGIN NOW Once you said, as we were listening to the Prayer in _Mose in Egitto_, 'For some it is the monotony of a single note; for others, it is the infinite of sound.' END
BEGIN NOW Remember that I am expecting you this evening to take me to de Beauseant's ball. END
BEGIN NOW Every one knows now that the King signed M. d'Ajuda's marriage-contract this morning, and the poor Vicomtesse knew nothing of it until two o'clock this afternoon. END
BEGIN NOW All Paris will flock to her house, of course, just as a crowd fills the Place de Greve to see an execution. END
BEGIN NOW It is horrible, is it not, to go out of curiosity to see if she will hide her anguish, and whether she will die courageously? END
BEGIN NOW I certainly should not go, my friend, if I had been at her house before; but, of course, she will not receive society any more after this, and all my efforts would be in vain. END
BEGIN NOW My position is a very unusual one, and besides, I am going there partly on your account. END
BEGIN NOW I am waiting for you. END
BEGIN NOW If you are not beside me in less than two hours, I do not know whether I could forgive such treason. END
BEGIN NOW Rastignac took up a pen and wrote: I am waiting till the doctor comes to know if there is any hope of your father's life. END
BEGIN NOW He is lying dangerously ill. END
BEGIN NOW I will come and bring you the news, but I am afraid it may be a sentence of death. END
BEGIN NOW When I come you can decide whether you can go to the ball.&mdash;Yours a thousand times. END
BEGIN NOW At half-past eight the doctor arrived. END
BEGIN NOW He did not take a very hopeful view of the case, but thought that there was no immediate danger. END
BEGIN NOW Improvements and relapses might be expected, and the good man's life and reason hung in the balance. END
BEGIN NOW It would be better for him to die at once, the doctor said as he took leave. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene left Goriot to Bianchon's care, and went to carry the sad news to de Nucingen. END
BEGIN NOW Family feeling lingered in her, and this must put an end for the present to her plans of amusement. END
BEGIN NOW Tell her to enjoy her evening as if nothing had happened, cried Goriot. END
BEGIN NOW He had been lying in a sort of stupor, but he suddenly sat upright as Eugene went out. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene, half heartbroken, entered Delphine's. END
BEGIN NOW Her hair had been dressed; she wore her dancing slippers; she had only to put on her ball-dress; but when the artist is giving the finishing stroke to his creation, the last touches require more time than the whole groundwork of the picture. END
BEGIN NOW Why, you are not dressed! END
BEGIN NOW she cried. END
BEGIN NOW Madame, your father&mdash;- My father again! END
BEGIN NOW she exclaimed, breaking in upon him. END
BEGIN NOW You need not teach me what is due to my father, I have known my father this long while. END
BEGIN NOW Not a word, Eugene. END
BEGIN NOW I will hear what you have to say when you are dressed. END
BEGIN NOW My carriage is waiting, take it, go round to your rooms and dress, Therese has put out everything in readiness for you. END
BEGIN NOW Come back as soon as you can; we will talk about my father on the way to de Beauseant's. END
BEGIN NOW We must go early; if we have to wait our turn in a row of carriages, we shall be lucky if we get there by eleven o'clock. END
BEGIN NOW Madame&mdash;- Quick! END
BEGIN NOW not a word! END
BEGIN NOW she cried, darting into her dressing-room for a necklace. END
BEGIN NOW Do go, Monsieur Eugene, or you will vex madame, said Therese, hurrying him away; and Eugene was too horror-stricken by this elegant parricide to resist. END
BEGIN NOW He went to his rooms and dressed, sad, thoughtful, and dispirited. END
BEGIN NOW The world of Paris was like an ocean of mud for him just then; and it seemed that whoever set foot in that black mire must needs sink into it up to the chin. END
BEGIN NOW Their crimes are paltry, said Eugene to himself. END
BEGIN NOW Vautrin was greater. END
BEGIN NOW He had seen society in its three great phases&mdash;Obedience, Struggle, and Revolt; the Family, the World, and Vautrin; and he hesitated in his choice. END
BEGIN NOW Obedience was dull, Revolt impossible, Struggle hazardous. END
BEGIN NOW His thoughts wandered back to the home circle. END
BEGIN NOW He thought of the quiet uneventful life, the pure happiness of the days spent among those who loved him there. END
BEGIN NOW Those loving and beloved beings passed their lives in obedience to the natural laws of the hearth, and in that obedience found a deep and constant serenity, unvexed by torments such as these. END
BEGIN NOW Yet, for all his good impulses, he could not bring himself to make profession of the religion of pure souls to Delphine, nor to prescribe the duties of piety to her in the name of love. END
BEGIN NOW His education had begun to bear its fruits; he loved selfishly already. END
BEGIN NOW Besides, his tact had discovered to him the real nature of Delphine; he divined instinctively that she was capable of stepping over her father's corpse to go to the ball; and within himself he felt that he had neither the strength of mind to play the part of mentor, nor the strength of character to vex her, nor the courage to leave her to go alone. END
BEGIN NOW She would never forgive me for putting her in the wrong over it, he said to himself. END
BEGIN NOW Then he turned the doctor's dictum over in his mind; he tried to believe that Goriot was not so dangerously ill as he had imagined, and ended by collecting together a sufficient quantity of traitorous excuses for Delphine's conduct. END
BEGIN NOW She did not know how ill her father was; the kind old man himself would have made her go to the ball if she had gone to see him. END
BEGIN NOW So often it happens that this one or that stands condemned by the social laws that govern family relations; and yet there are peculiar circumstances in the case, differences of temperament, divergent interests, innumerable complications of family life that excuse the apparent offence. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene did not wish to see too clearly; he was ready to sacrifice his conscience to his mistress. END
BEGIN NOW Within the last few days his whole life had undergone a change. END
BEGIN NOW Woman had entered into his world and thrown it into chaos, family claims dwindled away before her; she had appropriated all his being to her uses. END
BEGIN NOW Rastignac and Delphine found each other at a crisis in their lives when their union gave them the most poignant bliss. END
BEGIN NOW Their passion, so long proved, had only gained in strength by the gratified desire that often extinguishes passion. END
BEGIN NOW This woman was his, and Eugene recognized that not until then had he loved her; perhaps love is only gratitude for pleasure. END
BEGIN NOW This woman, vile or sublime, he adored for the pleasure she had brought as her dower; and Delphine loved Rastignac as Tantalus would have loved some angel who had satisfied his hunger and quenched the burning thirst in his parched throat. END
BEGIN NOW Well, said de Nucingen when he came back in evening dress, how is my father? END
BEGIN NOW Very dangerously ill, he answered; if you will grant me a proof of your affections, we will just go in to see him on the way. END
BEGIN NOW Very well, she said. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, but afterwards. END
BEGIN NOW Dear Eugene, do be nice, and don't preach to me. END
BEGIN NOW Come. END
BEGIN NOW They set out. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene said nothing for a while. END
BEGIN NOW What is it now? END
BEGIN NOW she asked. END
BEGIN NOW I can hear the death-rattle in your father's throat, he said almost angrily. END
BEGIN NOW And with the hot indignation of youth, he told the story of de Restaud's vanity and cruelty, of her father's final act of self-sacrifice, that had brought about this struggle between life and death, of the price that had been paid for Anastasie's golden embroideries. END
BEGIN NOW Delphine cried. END
BEGIN NOW I shall look frightful, she thought. END
BEGIN NOW She dried her tears. END
BEGIN NOW I will nurse my father; I will not leave his bedside, she said aloud. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW now you are as I would have you, exclaimed Rastignac. END
BEGIN NOW The lamps of five hundred carriages lit up the darkness about the Hotel de Beauseant. END
BEGIN NOW A gendarme in all the glory of his uniform stood on either side of the brightly lighted gateway. END
BEGIN NOW The great world was flocking thither that night in its eager curiosity to see the great lady at the moment of her fall, and the rooms on the ground floor were already full to overflowing, when de Nucingen and Rastignac appeared. END
BEGIN NOW Never since Louis XIV. END
BEGIN NOW tore her lover away from La grand Mademoiselle, and the whole court hastened to visit that unfortunate princess, had a disastrous love affair made such a sensation in Paris. END
BEGIN NOW But the youngest daughter of the almost royal house of Burgundy had risen proudly above her pain, and moved till the last moment like a queen in this world&mdash;its vanities had always been valueless for her, save in so far as they contributed to the triumph of her passion. END
BEGIN NOW The salons were filled with the most beautiful women in Paris, resplendent in their toilettes, and radiant with smiles. END
BEGIN NOW Ministers and ambassadors, the most distinguished men at court, men bedizened with decorations, stars, and ribbons, men who bore the most illustrious names in France, had gathered about the Vicomtesse. END
BEGIN NOW The music of the orchestra vibrated in wave after wave of sound from the golden ceiling of the palace, now made desolate for its queen. END
BEGIN NOW Madame de Beauseant stood at the door of the first salon to receive the guests who were styled her friends. END
BEGIN NOW She was dressed in white, and wore no ornament in the plaits of hair braided about her head; her face was calm; there was no sign there of pride, nor of pain, nor of joy that she did not feel. END
BEGIN NOW No one could read her soul; she stood there like some Niobe carved in marble. END
BEGIN NOW For a few intimate friends there was a tinge of satire in her smile; but no scrutiny saw any change in her, nor had she looked otherwise in the days of the glory of her happiness. END
BEGIN NOW The most callous of her guests admired her as young Rome applauded some gladiator who could die smiling. END
BEGIN NOW It seemed as if society had adorned itself for a last audience of one of its sovereigns. END
BEGIN NOW I was afraid that you would not come, she said to Rastignac. END
BEGIN NOW Madame, he said, in an unsteady voice, taking her speech as a reproach, I shall be the last to go, that is why I am here. END
BEGIN NOW Good, she said, and she took his hand. END
BEGIN NOW You are perhaps the only one I can trust here among all these. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, my friend, when you love, love a woman whom you are sure that you can love always. END
BEGIN NOW Never forsake a woman. END
BEGIN NOW She took Rastignac's arm, and went towards a sofa in the card-room. END
BEGIN NOW I want you to go to the Marquis, she said. END
BEGIN NOW Jacques, my footman, will go with you; he has a letter that you will take. END
BEGIN NOW I am asking the Marquis to give my letters back to me. END
BEGIN NOW He will give them all up, I like to think that. END
BEGIN NOW When you have my letters, go up to my room with them. END
BEGIN NOW Some one shall bring me word. END
BEGIN NOW She rose to go to meet the Duchesse de Langeais, her most intimate friend, who had come like the rest of the world. END
BEGIN NOW Rastignac went. END
BEGIN NOW He asked for the Marquis d'Ajuda at the Hotel Rochefide, feeling certain that the latter would be spending his evening there, and so it proved. END
BEGIN NOW The Marquis went to his own house with Rastignac, and gave a casket to the student, saying as he did so, They are all there. END
BEGIN NOW He seemed as if he was about to say something to Eugene, to ask about the ball, or the Vicomtesse; perhaps he was on the brink of the confession that, even then, he was in despair, and knew that his marriage had been a fatal mistake; but a proud gleam shone in his eyes, and with deplorable courage he kept his noblest feelings a secret. END
BEGIN NOW Do not even mention my name to her, my dear Eugene. END
BEGIN NOW He grasped Rastignac's hand sadly and affectionately, and turned away from him. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene went back to the Hotel Beauseant, the servant took him to the Vicomtesse's room. END
BEGIN NOW There were signs there of preparations for a journey. END
BEGIN NOW He sat down by the fire, fixed his eyes on the cedar wood casket, and fell into deep mournful musings. END
BEGIN NOW de Beauseant loomed large in these imaginings, like a goddess in the Iliad. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW my friend!... END
BEGIN NOW said the Vicomtesse; she crossed the room and laid her hand on Rastignac's shoulder. END
BEGIN NOW He saw the tears in his cousin's uplifted eyes, saw that one hand was raised to take the casket, and that the fingers of the other trembled. END
BEGIN NOW Suddenly she took the casket, put it in the fire, and watched it burn. END
BEGIN NOW They are dancing, she said. END
BEGIN NOW They all came very early; but death will be long in coming. END
BEGIN NOW Hush! END
BEGIN NOW my friend, and she laid a finger on Rastignac's lips, seeing that he was about to speak. END
BEGIN NOW I shall never see Paris again. END
BEGIN NOW I am taking my leave of the world. END
BEGIN NOW At five o'clock this morning I shall set out on my journey; I mean to bury myself in the remotest part of Normandy. END
BEGIN NOW I have had very little time to make my arrangements; since three o'clock this afternoon I have been busy signing documents, setting my affairs in order; there was no one whom I could send to... She broke off. END
BEGIN NOW He was sure to be... Again she broke off; the weight of her sorrow was more than she could bear. END
BEGIN NOW In such moments as these everything is agony, and some words are impossible to utter. END
BEGIN NOW And so I counted upon you to do me this last piece of service this evening, she said. END
BEGIN NOW I should like to give you some pledge of friendship. END
BEGIN NOW I shall often think of you. END
BEGIN NOW You have seemed to me to be kind and noble, fresh-hearted and true, in this world where such qualities are seldom found. END
BEGIN NOW I should like you to think sometimes of me. END
BEGIN NOW Stay, she said, glancing about her, there is this box that has held my gloves. END
BEGIN NOW Every time I opened it before going to a ball or to the theatre, I used to feel that I must be beautiful, because I was so happy; and I never touched it except to lay some gracious memory in it: there is so much of my old self in it, of a Madame de Beauseant who now lives no longer. END
BEGIN NOW Will you take it? END
BEGIN NOW I will leave directions that it is to be sent to you in the Rue d'Artois.&mdash; de Nucingen looked very charming this evening. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene, you must love her. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps we may never see each other again, my friend; but be sure of this, that I shall pray for you who have been kind to me.&mdash;Now, let us go downstairs. END
BEGIN NOW People shall not think that I am weeping. END
BEGIN NOW I have all time and eternity before me, and where I am going I shall be alone, and no one will ask me the reason of my tears. END
BEGIN NOW One last look round first. END
BEGIN NOW She stood for a moment. END
BEGIN NOW Then she covered her eyes with her hands for an instant, dashed away the tears, bathed her face with cold water, and took the student's arm. END
BEGIN NOW Let us go! END
BEGIN NOW she said. END
BEGIN NOW This suffering, endured with such noble fortitude, shook Eugene with a more violent emotion than he had felt before. END
BEGIN NOW They went back to the ballroom, and de Beauseant went through the rooms on Eugene's arm&mdash;the last delicately gracious act of a gracious woman. END
BEGIN NOW In another moment he saw the sisters, de Restaud and de Nucingen. END
BEGIN NOW The Countess shone in all the glory of her magnificent diamonds; every stone must have scorched like fire, she was never to wear them again. END
BEGIN NOW Strong as love and pride might be in her, she found it difficult to meet her husband's eyes. END
BEGIN NOW The sight of her was scarcely calculated to lighten Rastignac's sad thoughts; through the blaze of those diamonds he seemed to see the wretched pallet-bed on which Father Goriot was lying. END
BEGIN NOW The Vicomtesse misread his melancholy; she withdrew her hand from his arm. END
BEGIN NOW Come, she said, I must not deprive you of a pleasure. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene was soon claimed by Delphine. END
BEGIN NOW She was delighted by the impression that she had made, and eager to lay at her lover's feet the homage she had received in this new world in which she hoped to live and move henceforth. END
BEGIN NOW What do you think of Nasie? END
BEGIN NOW she asked him. END
BEGIN NOW She has discounted everything, even her own father's death, said Rastignac. END
BEGIN NOW Towards four o'clock in the morning the rooms began to empty. END
BEGIN NOW A little later the music ceased, and the Duchesse de Langeais and Rastignac were left in the great ballroom. END
BEGIN NOW The Vicomtesse, who thought to find the student there alone, came back there at last. END
BEGIN NOW She had taken leave of M. de Beauseant, who had gone off to bed, saying again as he went, It is a great pity, my dear, to shut yourself up at your age! END
BEGIN NOW Pray stay among us. END
BEGIN NOW de Beauseant saw the Duchesse, and, in spite of herself, an exclamation broke from her. END
BEGIN NOW I saw how it was, Clara, said de Langeais. END
BEGIN NOW You are going from among us, and you will never come back. END
BEGIN NOW But you must not go until you have heard me, until we have understood each other. END
BEGIN NOW She took her friend's arm, and they went together into the next room. END
BEGIN NOW There the Duchess looked at her with tears in her eyes; she held her friend in close embrace and kissed her cheek. END
BEGIN NOW I could not let you go without a word, dearest; the remorse would have been too hard to bear. END
BEGIN NOW You can count upon me as surely as upon yourself. END
BEGIN NOW You have shown yourself great this evening; I feel that I am worthy of our friendship, and I mean to prove myself worthy of it. END
BEGIN NOW I have not always been kind; I was in the wrong; forgive me, dearest; I wish I could unsay anything that may have hurt you; I take back those words. END
BEGIN NOW One common sorrow has brought us together again, for I do not know which of us is the more miserable. END
BEGIN NOW M. de Montriveau was not here to-night; do you understand what that means?&mdash;None of those who saw you to-night, Clara, will ever forget you. END
BEGIN NOW I mean to make one last effort. END
BEGIN NOW If I fail, I shall go into a convent. END
BEGIN NOW Clara, where are you going? END
BEGIN NOW Into Normandy, to Courcelles. END
BEGIN NOW I shall love and pray there until the day when God shall take me from this world.&mdash;M. de Rastignac! END
BEGIN NOW called the Vicomtesse, in a tremulous voice, remembering that the young man was waiting there. END
BEGIN NOW The student knelt to kiss his cousin's hand. END
BEGIN NOW Good-bye, Antoinette! END
BEGIN NOW said de Beauseant. END
BEGIN NOW May you be happy. END
BEGIN NOW &mdash;She turned to the student. END
BEGIN NOW You are young, she said; you have some beliefs still left. END
BEGIN NOW I have been privileged, like some dying people, to find sincere and reverent feeling in those about me as I take my leave of this world. END
BEGIN NOW It was nearly five o'clock that morning when Rastignac came away. END
BEGIN NOW He had put de Beauseant into her traveling carriage, and received her last farewells, spoken amid fast-falling tears; for no greatness is so great that it can rise above the laws of human affection, or live beyond the jurisdiction of pain, as certain demagogues would have the people believe. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene returned on foot to the Maison Vauquer through the cold and darkness. END
BEGIN NOW His education was nearly complete. END
BEGIN NOW There is no hope for poor Father Goriot, said Bianchon, as Rastignac came into the room. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene looked for a while at the sleeping man, then he turned to his friend. END
BEGIN NOW Dear fellow, you are content with the modest career you have marked out for yourself; keep to it. END
BEGIN NOW I am in hell, and I must stay there. END
BEGIN NOW Believe everything that you hear said of the world, nothing is too impossibly bad. END
BEGIN NOW No Juvenal could paint the horrors hidden away under the covering of gems and gold. END
BEGIN NOW At two o'clock in the afternoon Bianchon came to wake Rastignac, and begged him to take charge of Goriot, who had grown worse as the day wore on. END
BEGIN NOW The medical student was obliged to go out. END
BEGIN NOW Poor old man, he has not two days to live, maybe not many hours, he said; but we must do our utmost, all the same, to fight the disease. END
BEGIN NOW It will be a very troublesome case, and we shall want money. END
BEGIN NOW We can nurse him between us, of course, but, for my own part, I have not a penny. END
BEGIN NOW I have turned out his pockets, and rummaged through his drawers&mdash;result, nix. END
BEGIN NOW I asked him about it while his mind was clear, and he told me he had not a farthing of his own. END
BEGIN NOW What have you? END
BEGIN NOW I have twenty francs left, said Rastignac; but I will take them to the roulette table, I shall be sure to win. END
BEGIN NOW And if you lose? END
BEGIN NOW Then I shall go to his sons-in-law and his daughters and ask them for money. END
BEGIN NOW And suppose they refuse? END
BEGIN NOW Bianchon retorted. END
BEGIN NOW The most pressing thing just now is not really money; we must put mustard poultices, as hot as they can be made, on his feet and legs. END
BEGIN NOW If he calls out, there is still some hope for him. END
BEGIN NOW You know how to set about doing it, and besides, Christophe will help you. END
BEGIN NOW I am going round to the dispensary to persuade them to let us have the things we want on credit. END
BEGIN NOW It is a pity that we could not move him to the hospital; poor fellow, he would be better there. END
BEGIN NOW Well, come along, I leave you in charge; you must stay with him till I come back. END
BEGIN NOW The two young men went back to the room where the old man was lying. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene was startled at the change in Goriot's face, so livid, distorted, and feeble. END
BEGIN NOW How are you, papa? END
BEGIN NOW he said, bending over the pallet-bed. END
BEGIN NOW Goriot turned his dull eyes upon Eugene, looked at him attentively, and did not recognize him. END
BEGIN NOW It was more than the student could bear; the tears came into his eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Bianchon, ought we to have the curtains put up in the windows? END
BEGIN NOW No, the temperature and the light do not affect him now. END
BEGIN NOW It would be a good thing for him if he felt heat or cold; but we must have a fire in any case to make tisanes and heat the other things. END
BEGIN NOW I will send round a few sticks; they will last till we can have in some firewood. END
BEGIN NOW I burned all the bark fuel you had left, as well as his, poor man, yesterday and during the night. END
BEGIN NOW The place is so damp that the water stood in drops on the walls; I could hardly get the room dry. END
BEGIN NOW Christophe came in and swept the floor, but the place is like a stable; I had to burn juniper, the smell was something horrible. END
BEGIN NOW _Mon Dieu!_ said Rastignac. END
BEGIN NOW To think of those daughters of his. END
BEGIN NOW One moment, if he asks for something to drink, give him this, said the house student, pointing to a large white jar. END
BEGIN NOW If he begins to groan, and the belly feels hot and hard to the touch, you know what to do; get Christophe to help you. END
BEGIN NOW If he should happen to grow much excited, and begin to talk a good deal and even to ramble in his talk, do not be alarmed. END
BEGIN NOW It would not be a bad symptom. END
BEGIN NOW But send Christophe to the Hospice Cochin. END
BEGIN NOW Our doctor, my chum, or I will come and apply moxas. END
BEGIN NOW We had a great consultation this morning while you were asleep. END
BEGIN NOW A surgeon, a pupil of Gall's came, and our house surgeon, and the head physician from the Hotel-Dieu. END
BEGIN NOW Those gentlemen considered that the symptoms were very unusual and interesting; the case must be carefully watched, for it throws a light on several obscure and rather important scientific problems. END
BEGIN NOW One of the authorities says that if there is more pressure of serum on one or other portion of the brain, it should affect his mental capacities in such and such directions. END
BEGIN NOW So if he should talk, notice very carefully what kind of ideas his mind seems to run on; whether memory, or penetration, or the reasoning faculties are exercised; whether sentiments or practical questions fill his thoughts; whether he makes forecasts or dwells on the past; in fact; you must be prepared to give an accurate report of him. END
BEGIN NOW It is quite likely that the extravasation fills the whole brain, in which case he will die in the imbecile state in which he is lying now. END
BEGIN NOW You cannot tell anything about these mysterious nervous diseases. END
BEGIN NOW Suppose the crash came here, said Bianchon, touching the back of the head, very strange things have been known to happen; the brain sometimes partially recovers, and death is delayed. END
BEGIN NOW Or the congested matter may pass out of the brain altogether through channels which can only be determined by a post-mortem examination. END
BEGIN NOW There is an old man at the Hospital for Incurables, an imbecile patient, in his case the effusion has followed the direction of the spinal cord; he suffers horrid agonies, but he lives. END
BEGIN NOW Did they enjoy themselves? END
BEGIN NOW It was Father Goriot who spoke. END
BEGIN NOW He had recognized Eugene. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW he thinks of nothing but his daughters, said Bianchon. END
BEGIN NOW Scores of times last night he said to me, 'They are dancing now! END
BEGIN NOW She has her dress.' END
BEGIN NOW He called them by their names. END
BEGIN NOW He made me cry, the devil take it, calling with that tone in his voice, for 'Delphine! END
BEGIN NOW my little Delphine! END
BEGIN NOW and Nasie!' END
BEGIN NOW Upon my word, said the medical student, it was enough to make any one burst out crying. END
BEGIN NOW Delphine, said the old man, she is there, isn't she? END
BEGIN NOW I knew she was there, and his eyes sought the door. END
BEGIN NOW I am going down now to tell Sylvie to get the poultices ready, said Bianchon. END
BEGIN NOW They ought to go on at once. END
BEGIN NOW Rastignac was left alone with the old man. END
BEGIN NOW He sat at the foot of the bed, and gazed at the face before him, so horribly changed that it was shocking to see. END
BEGIN NOW Noble natures cannot dwell in this world, he said; Mme de Beauseant has fled from it, and there he lies dying. END
BEGIN NOW What place indeed is there in the shallow petty frivolous thing called society for noble thoughts and feelings? END
BEGIN NOW Pictures of yesterday's ball rose up in his memory, in strange contrast to the deathbed before him. END
BEGIN NOW Bianchon suddenly appeared. END
BEGIN NOW I say, Eugene, I have just seen our head surgeon at the hospital, and I ran all the way back here. END
BEGIN NOW If the old man shows any signs of reason, if he begins to talk, cover him with a mustard poultice from the neck to the base of the spine, and send round for us. END
BEGIN NOW Dear Bianchon, exclaimed Eugene. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW it is an interesting case from a scientific point of view, said the medical student, with all the enthusiasm of a neophyte. END
BEGIN NOW So! END
BEGIN NOW said Eugene. END
BEGIN NOW Am I really the only one who cares for the poor old man for his own sake? END
BEGIN NOW You would not have said so if you had seen me this morning, returned Bianchon, who did not take offence at this speech. END
BEGIN NOW Doctors who have seen a good deal of practice never see anything but the disease, but, my dear fellow, I can see the patient still. END
BEGIN NOW He went. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene was left alone with the old man, and with an apprehension of a crisis that set in, in fact, before very long. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW dear boy, is that you? END
BEGIN NOW said Father Goriot, recognizing Eugene. END
BEGIN NOW Do you feel better? END
BEGIN NOW asked the law student, taking his hand. END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW My head felt as if it were being screwed up in a vise, but now it is set free again. END
BEGIN NOW Did you see my girls? END
BEGIN NOW They will be here directly; as soon as they know that I am ill they will hurry here at once; they used to take such care of me in the Rue de la Jussienne! END
BEGIN NOW Great Heavens! END
BEGIN NOW if only my room was fit for them to come into! END
BEGIN NOW There has been a young man here, who has burned up all my bark fuel. END
BEGIN NOW I can hear Christophe coming upstairs, Eugene answered. END
BEGIN NOW He is bringing up some firewood that that young man has sent you. END
BEGIN NOW Good, but how am I to pay for the wood. END
BEGIN NOW I have not a penny left, dear boy. END
BEGIN NOW I have given everything, everything. END
BEGIN NOW I am a pauper now. END
BEGIN NOW Well, at least the golden gown was grand, was it not? END
BEGIN NOW (Ah! END
BEGIN NOW what pain this is!) END
BEGIN NOW Thanks, Christophe! END
BEGIN NOW God will reward you, my boy; I have nothing left now. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene went over to Christophe and whispered in the man's ear, I will pay you well, and Sylvie too, for your trouble. END
BEGIN NOW My daughters told you that they were coming, didn't they, Christophe? END
BEGIN NOW Go again to them, and I will give you five francs. END
BEGIN NOW Tell them that I am not feeling well, that I should like to kiss them both and see them once again before I die. END
BEGIN NOW Tell them that, but don't alarm them more than you can help. END
BEGIN NOW Rastignac signed to Christophe to go, and the man went. END
BEGIN NOW They will come before long, the old man went on. END
BEGIN NOW I know them so well. END
BEGIN NOW My tender-hearted Delphine! END
BEGIN NOW If I am going to die, she will feel it so much! END
BEGIN NOW And so will Nasie. END
BEGIN NOW I do not want to die; they will cry if I die; and if I die, dear Eugene, I shall not see them any more. END
BEGIN NOW It will be very dreary there where I am going. END
BEGIN NOW For a father it is hell to be without your children; I have served my apprenticeship already since they married. END
BEGIN NOW My heaven was in the Rue de la Jussienne. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene, do you think that if I go to heaven I can come back to earth, and be near them in spirit? END
BEGIN NOW I have heard some such things said. END
BEGIN NOW It is true? END
BEGIN NOW It is as if I could see them at this moment as they used to be when we all lived in the Rue de la Jussienne. END
BEGIN NOW They used to come downstairs of a morning. END
BEGIN NOW 'Good-morning, papa!' END
BEGIN NOW they used to say, and I would take them on my knees; we had all sorts of little games of play together, and they had such pretty coaxing ways. END
BEGIN NOW We always had breakfast together, too, every morning, and they had dinner with me&mdash;in fact, I was a father then. END
BEGIN NOW I enjoyed my children. END
BEGIN NOW They did not think for themselves so long as they lived in the Rue de la Jussienne; they knew nothing of the world; they loved me with all their hearts. END
BEGIN NOW _Mon Dieu!_ why could they not always be little girls? END
BEGIN NOW (Oh! END
BEGIN NOW my head! END
BEGIN NOW this racking pain in my head!) END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW ah! END
BEGIN NOW forgive me, children, this pain is fearful; it must be agony indeed, for you have used me to endure pain. END
BEGIN NOW _Mon Dieu!_ if only I held their hands in mine, I should not feel it at all.&mdash;Do you think that they are on the way? END
BEGIN NOW Christophe is so stupid; I ought to have gone myself. END
BEGIN NOW _He_ will see them. END
BEGIN NOW But you went to the ball yesterday; just tell me how they looked. END
BEGIN NOW They did not know that I was ill, did they, or they would not have been dancing, poor little things? END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW I must not be ill any longer. END
BEGIN NOW They stand too much in need of me; their fortunes are in danger. END
BEGIN NOW And such husbands as they are bound to! END
BEGIN NOW I must get well! END
BEGIN NOW (Oh! END
BEGIN NOW what pain this is! END
BEGIN NOW what pain this is!\... ah! END
BEGIN NOW ah! END
BEGIN NOW )&mdash;I must get well, you see; for they _must_ have money, and I know how to set about making some. END
BEGIN NOW I will go to Odessa and manufacture starch there. END
BEGIN NOW I am an old hand, I will make millions. END
BEGIN NOW (Oh! END
BEGIN NOW this is agony!) END
BEGIN NOW Goriot was silent for a moment; it seemed to require his whole strength to endure the pain. END
BEGIN NOW If they were here, I should not complain, he said. END
BEGIN NOW So why should I complain now? END
BEGIN NOW He seemed to grow drowsy with exhaustion, and lay quietly for a long time. END
BEGIN NOW Christophe came back; and Rastignac, thinking that Goriot was asleep, allowed the man to give his story aloud. END
BEGIN NOW First of all, sir, I went to Madame la Comtesse, he said; but she and her husband were so busy that I couldn't get to speak to her. END
BEGIN NOW When I insisted that I must see her, M. de Restaud came out to me himself, and went on like this: 'M. END
BEGIN NOW Goriot is dying, is he? END
BEGIN NOW Very well, it is the best thing he can do. END
BEGIN NOW I want de Restaud to transact some important business, when it is all finished she can go.' END
BEGIN NOW The gentleman looked angry, I thought. END
BEGIN NOW I was just going away when de Restaud came out into an ante-chamber through a door that I did not notice, and said, 'Christophe, tell my father that my husband wants me to discuss some matters with him, and I cannot leave the house, the life or death of my children is at stake; but as soon as it is over, I will come.' END
BEGIN NOW As for Madame la Baronne, that is another story! END
BEGIN NOW I could not speak to her either, and I did not even see her. END
BEGIN NOW Her waiting-woman said, 'Ah yes, but madame only came back from a ball at a quarter to five this morning; she is asleep now, and if I wake her before mid-day she will be cross. END
BEGIN NOW As soon as she rings, I will go and tell her that her father is worse. END
BEGIN NOW It will be time enough then to tell her bad news!' END
BEGIN NOW I begged and I prayed, but, there! END
BEGIN NOW it was no good. END
BEGIN NOW Then I asked for M. le Baron, but he was out. END
BEGIN NOW To think that neither of his daughters should come! END
BEGIN NOW exclaimed Rastignac. END
BEGIN NOW I will write to them both. END
BEGIN NOW Neither of them! END
BEGIN NOW cried the old man, sitting upright in bed. END
BEGIN NOW They are busy, they are asleep, they will not come! END
BEGIN NOW I knew that they would not. END
BEGIN NOW Not until you are dying do you know your children.... Oh! END
BEGIN NOW my friend, do not marry; do not have children! END
BEGIN NOW You give them life; they give you your deathblow. END
BEGIN NOW You bring them into the world, and they send you out of it. END
BEGIN NOW No, they will not come. END
BEGIN NOW I have known that these ten years. END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes I have told myself so, but I did not dare to believe it. END
BEGIN NOW The tears gathered and stood without overflowing the red sockets. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW if I were rich still, if I had kept my money, if I had not given all to them, they would be with me now; they would fawn on me and cover my cheeks with their kisses! END
BEGIN NOW I should be living in a great mansion; I should have grand apartments and servants and a fire in my room; and _they_ would be about me all in tears, and their husbands and their children. END
BEGIN NOW I should have had all that; now&mdash;I have nothing. END
BEGIN NOW Money brings everything to you; even your daughters. END
BEGIN NOW My money. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW where is my money? END
BEGIN NOW If I had plenty of money to leave behind me, they would nurse me and tend me; I should hear their voices, I should see their faces. END
BEGIN NOW Ah, God! END
BEGIN NOW who knows? END
BEGIN NOW They both of them have hearts of stone. END
BEGIN NOW I loved them too much; it was not likely that they should love me. END
BEGIN NOW A father ought always to be rich; he ought to keep his children well in hand, like unruly horses. END
BEGIN NOW I have gone down on my knees to them. END
BEGIN NOW Wretches! END
BEGIN NOW this is the crowning act that brings the last ten years to a proper close. END
BEGIN NOW If you but knew how much they made of me just after they were married. END
BEGIN NOW (Oh! END
BEGIN NOW this is cruel torture!) END
BEGIN NOW I had just given them each eight hundred thousand francs; they were bound to be civil to me after that, and their husbands too were civil. END
BEGIN NOW I used to go to their houses: it was 'My kind father' here, 'My dear father' there. END
BEGIN NOW There was always a place for me at their tables. END
BEGIN NOW I used to dine with their husbands now and then, and they were very respectful to me. END
BEGIN NOW I was still worth something, they thought. END
BEGIN NOW How should they know? END
BEGIN NOW I had not said anything about my affairs. END
BEGIN NOW It is worth while to be civil to a man who has given his daughters eight hundred thousand francs apiece; and they showed me every attention then&mdash;but it was all for my money. END
BEGIN NOW Grand people are not great. END
BEGIN NOW I found that out by experience! END
BEGIN NOW I went to the theatre with them in their carriage; I might stay as long as I cared to stay at their evening parties. END
BEGIN NOW In fact, they acknowledged me their father; publicly they owned that they were my daughters. END
BEGIN NOW But I was always a shrewd one, you see, and nothing was lost upon me. END
BEGIN NOW Everything went straight to the mark and pierced my heart. END
BEGIN NOW I saw quite well that it was all sham and pretence, but there is no help for such things as these. END
BEGIN NOW I felt less at my ease at their dinner-table than I did downstairs here. END
BEGIN NOW I had nothing to say for myself. END
BEGIN NOW So these grand folks would ask in my son-in-law's ear, 'Who may that gentleman be? END
BEGIN NOW '&mdash;'The father-in-law with the money bags; he is very rich. END
BEGIN NOW '&mdash;'The devil, he is!' END
BEGIN NOW they would say, and look again at me with the respect due to my money. END
BEGIN NOW Well, if I was in the way sometimes, I paid dearly for my mistakes. END
BEGIN NOW And besides, who is perfect? END
BEGIN NOW (My head is one sore!) END
BEGIN NOW Dear Monsieur Eugene, I am suffering so now, that a man might die of the pain; but it is nothing to be compared with the pain I endured when Anastasie made me feel, for the first time, that I had said something stupid. END
BEGIN NOW She looked at me, and that glance of hers opened all my veins. END
BEGIN NOW I used to want to know everything, to be learned; and one thing I did learn thoroughly&mdash;I knew that I was not wanted here on earth. END
BEGIN NOW The next day I went to Delphine for comfort, and what should I do there but make some stupid blunder that made her angry with me. END
BEGIN NOW I was like one driven out of his senses. END
BEGIN NOW For a week I did not know what to do; I did not dare to go to see them for fear they should reproach me. END
BEGIN NOW And that was how they both turned me out of the house. END
BEGIN NOW Oh God! END
BEGIN NOW Thou knowest all the misery and anguish that I have endured; Thou hast counted all the wounds that have been dealt to me in these years that have aged and changed me and whitened my hair and drained my life; why dost Thou make me to suffer so to-day? END
BEGIN NOW Have I not more than expiated the sin of loving them too much? END
BEGIN NOW They themselves have been the instruments of vengeance; they have tortured me for my sin of affection. END
BEGIN NOW Ah, well! END
BEGIN NOW fathers know no better; I loved them so; I went back to them as a gambler goes to the gaming table. END
BEGIN NOW This love was my vice, you see, my mistress&mdash;they were everything in the world to me. END
BEGIN NOW They were always wanting something or other, dresses and ornaments, and what not; their maids used to tell me what they wanted, and I used to give them the things for the sake of the welcome that they bought for me. END
BEGIN NOW But, at the same time, they used to give me little lectures on my behavior in society; they began about it at once. END
BEGIN NOW Then they began to feel ashamed of me. END
BEGIN NOW That is what comes of having your children well brought up. END
BEGIN NOW I could not go to school again at my time of life. END
BEGIN NOW (This pain is fearful! END
BEGIN NOW _Mon Dieu!_ These doctors! END
BEGIN NOW these doctors! END
BEGIN NOW If they would open my head, it would give me some relief!) END
BEGIN NOW Oh, my daughters, my daughters! END
BEGIN NOW Anastasie! END
BEGIN NOW Delphine! END
BEGIN NOW If I could only see them! END
BEGIN NOW Send for the police, and make them come to me! END
BEGIN NOW Justice is on my side, the whole world is on my side, I have natural rights, and the law with me. END
BEGIN NOW I protest! END
BEGIN NOW The country will go to ruin if a father's rights are trampled under foot. END
BEGIN NOW That is easy to see. END
BEGIN NOW The whole world turns on fatherly love; fatherly love is the foundation of society; it will crumble into ruin when children do not love their fathers. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW if I could only see them, and hear them, no matter what they said; if I could simply hear their voices, it would soothe the pain. END
BEGIN NOW Delphine! END
BEGIN NOW Delphine most of all. END
BEGIN NOW But tell them when they come not to look so coldly at me as they do. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW my friend, my good Monsieur Eugene, you do not know that it is when all the golden light in a glance suddenly turns to a leaden gray. END
BEGIN NOW It has been one long winter here since the light in their eyes shone no more for me. END
BEGIN NOW I have had nothing but disappointments to devour. END
BEGIN NOW Disappointment has been my daily bread; I have lived on humiliation and insults. END
BEGIN NOW I have swallowed down all the affronts for which they sold me my poor stealthy little moments of joy; for I love them so! END
BEGIN NOW Think of it! END
BEGIN NOW a father hiding himself to get a glimpse of his children! END
BEGIN NOW I have given all my life to them, and to-day they will not give me one hour! END
BEGIN NOW I am hungering and thirsting for them, my heart is burning in me, but they will not come to bring relief in the agony, for I am dying now, I feel that this is death. END
BEGIN NOW Do they not know what it means to trample on a father's corpse? END
BEGIN NOW There is a God in heaven who avenges us fathers whether we will or no. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW they will come! END
BEGIN NOW Come to me, darlings, and give me one more kiss; one last kiss, the Viaticum for your father, who will pray God for you in heaven. END
BEGIN NOW I will tell Him that you have been good children to your father, and plead your cause with God! END
BEGIN NOW After all, it is not their fault. END
BEGIN NOW I tell you they are innocent, my friend. END
BEGIN NOW Tell every one that it is not their fault, and no one need be distressed on my account. END
BEGIN NOW It is all my own fault, I taught them to trample upon me. END
BEGIN NOW I loved to have it so. END
BEGIN NOW It is no one's affair but mine; man's justice and God's justice have nothing to do in it. END
BEGIN NOW God would be unjust if He condemned them for anything they may have done to me. END
BEGIN NOW I did not behave to them properly; I was stupid enough to resign my rights. END
BEGIN NOW I would have humbled myself in the dust for them. END
BEGIN NOW What could you expect? END
BEGIN NOW The most beautiful nature, the noblest soul, would have been spoiled by such indulgence. END
BEGIN NOW I am a wretch, I am justly punished. END
BEGIN NOW I, and I only, am to blame for all their sins; I spoiled them. END
BEGIN NOW To-day they are as eager for pleasure as they used to be for sugar-plums. END
BEGIN NOW When they were little girls I indulged them in every whim. END
BEGIN NOW They had a carriage of their own when they were fifteen. END
BEGIN NOW They have never been crossed. END
BEGIN NOW I am guilty, and not they&mdash;but I sinned through love. END
BEGIN NOW My heart would open at the sound of their voices. END
BEGIN NOW I can hear them; they are coming. END
BEGIN NOW Yes! END
BEGIN NOW yes! END
BEGIN NOW they are coming. END
BEGIN NOW The law demands that they should be present at their father's deathbed; the law is on my side. END
BEGIN NOW It would only cost them the hire of a cab. END
BEGIN NOW I would pay that. END
BEGIN NOW Write to them, tell them that I have millions to leave to them! END
BEGIN NOW On my word of honor, yes. END
BEGIN NOW I am going to manufacture Italian paste foods at Odessa. END
BEGIN NOW I understand the trade. END
BEGIN NOW There are millions to be made in it. END
BEGIN NOW Nobody has thought of the scheme as yet. END
BEGIN NOW You see, there will be no waste, no damage in transit, as there always is with wheat and flour. END
BEGIN NOW Hey! END
BEGIN NOW hey! END
BEGIN NOW and starch too; there are millions to be made in the starch trade! END
BEGIN NOW You will not be telling a lie. END
BEGIN NOW Millions, tell them; and even if they really come because they covet the money, I would rather let them deceive me; and I shall see them in any case. END
BEGIN NOW I want my children! END
BEGIN NOW I gave them life; they are mine, mine! END
BEGIN NOW and he sat upright. END
BEGIN NOW The head thus raised, with its scanty white hair, seemed to Eugene like a threat; every line that could still speak spoke of menace. END
BEGIN NOW There, there, dear father, said Eugene, lie down again; I will write to them at once. END
BEGIN NOW As soon as Bianchon comes back I will go for them myself, if they do not come before. END
BEGIN NOW If they do not come? END
BEGIN NOW repeated the old man, sobbing. END
BEGIN NOW Why, I shall be dead before then; I shall die in a fit of rage, of rage! END
BEGIN NOW Anger is getting the better of me. END
BEGIN NOW I can see my whole life at this minute. END
BEGIN NOW I have been cheated! END
BEGIN NOW They do not love me&mdash;they have never loved me all their lives! END
BEGIN NOW It is all clear to me. END
BEGIN NOW They have not come, and they will not come. END
BEGIN NOW The longer they put off their coming, the less they are likely to give me this joy. END
BEGIN NOW I know them. END
BEGIN NOW They have never cared to guess my disappointments, my sorrows, my wants; they never cared to know my life; they will have no presentiment of my death; they do not even know the secret of my tenderness for them. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, I see it all now. END
BEGIN NOW I have laid my heart open so often, that they take everything I do for them as a matter of course. END
BEGIN NOW They might have asked me for the very eyes out of my head and I would have bidden them to pluck them out. END
BEGIN NOW They think that all fathers are like theirs. END
BEGIN NOW You should always make your value felt. END
BEGIN NOW Their own children will avenge me. END
BEGIN NOW Why, for their own sakes they should come to me! END
BEGIN NOW Make them understand that they are laying up retribution for their own deathbeds. END
BEGIN NOW All crimes are summed up in this one.... Go to them; just tell them that if they stay away it will be parricide! END
BEGIN NOW There is enough laid to their charge already without adding that to the list. END
BEGIN NOW Cry aloud as I do now, 'Nasie! END
BEGIN NOW Delphine! END
BEGIN NOW here! END
BEGIN NOW Come to your father; the father who has been so kind to you is lying ill! END
BEGIN NOW '&mdash;Not a sound; no one comes! END
BEGIN NOW Then am I to die like a dog? END
BEGIN NOW This is to be my reward&mdash;I am forsaken at the last. END
BEGIN NOW They are wicked, heartless women; curses on them, I loathe them. END
BEGIN NOW I shall rise at night from my grave to curse them again; for, after all, my friends, have I done wrong? END
BEGIN NOW They are behaving very badly to me, eh?\... What am I saying? END
BEGIN NOW Did you not tell me just now that Delphine is in the room? END
BEGIN NOW She is more tender-hearted than her sister.... Eugene, you are my son, you know. END
BEGIN NOW You will love her; be a father to her! END
BEGIN NOW Her sister is very unhappy. END
BEGIN NOW And there are their fortunes! END
BEGIN NOW Ah, God! END
BEGIN NOW I am dying, this anguish is almost more than I can bear! END
BEGIN NOW Cut off my head; leave me nothing but my heart. END
BEGIN NOW Christophe! END
BEGIN NOW shouted Eugene, alarmed by the way in which the old man moaned, and by his cries, go for M. Bianchon, and send a cab here for me.&mdash;I am going to fetch them, dear father; I will bring them back to you. END
BEGIN NOW Make them come! END
BEGIN NOW Compel them to come! END
BEGIN NOW Call out the Guard, the military, anything and everything, but make them come! END
BEGIN NOW He looked at Eugene, and a last gleam of intelligence shone in his eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Go to the authorities, to the Public Prosecutor, let them bring them here; come they shall! END
BEGIN NOW But you have cursed them. END
BEGIN NOW Who said that! END
BEGIN NOW said the old man in dull amazement. END
BEGIN NOW You know quite well that I love them, I adore them! END
BEGIN NOW I shall be quite well again if I can see them.... Go for them, my good neighbor, my dear boy, you are kind-hearted; I wish I could repay you for your kindness, but I have nothing to give you now, save the blessing of a dying man. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW if I could only see Delphine, to tell her to pay my debt to you. END
BEGIN NOW If the other cannot come, bring Delphine to me at any rate. END
BEGIN NOW Tell her that unless she comes, you will not love her any more. END
BEGIN NOW She is so fond of you that she will come to me then. END
BEGIN NOW Give me something to drink! END
BEGIN NOW There is a fire in my bowels. END
BEGIN NOW Press something against my forehead! END
BEGIN NOW If my daughters would lay their hands there, I think I should get better.\... _Mon Dieu!_ who will recover their money for them when I am gone?... END
BEGIN NOW I will manufacture vermicelli out in Odessa; I will go to Odessa for their sakes. END
BEGIN NOW Here is something to drink, said Eugene, supporting the dying man on his left arm, while he held a cup of tisane to Goriot's lips. END
BEGIN NOW How you must love your own father and mother! END
BEGIN NOW said the old man, and grasped the student's hand in both of his. END
BEGIN NOW It was a feeble, trembling grasp. END
BEGIN NOW I am going to die; I shall die without seeing my daughters; do you understand? END
BEGIN NOW To be always thirsting, and never to drink; that has been my life for the last ten years.... END
BEGIN NOW I have no daughters, my sons-in-law killed them. END
BEGIN NOW No, since their marriages they have been dead to me. END
BEGIN NOW Fathers should petition the Chambers to pass a law against marriage. END
BEGIN NOW If you love your daughters, do not let them marry. END
BEGIN NOW A son-in-law is a rascal who poisons a girl's mind and contaminates her whole nature. END
BEGIN NOW Let us have no more marriages! END
BEGIN NOW It robs us of our daughters; we are left alone upon our deathbeds, and they are not with us then. END
BEGIN NOW They ought to pass a law for dying fathers. END
BEGIN NOW This is awful! END
BEGIN NOW It cries for vengeance! END
BEGIN NOW They cannot come, because my sons-in-law forbid them!... END
BEGIN NOW Kill them!... END
BEGIN NOW Restaud and the Alsatian, kill them both! END
BEGIN NOW They have murdered me between them!... END
BEGIN NOW Death or my daughters!... END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW it is too late, I am dying, and they are not here!... END
BEGIN NOW Dying without them!... END
BEGIN NOW Nasie! END
BEGIN NOW Fifine! END
BEGIN NOW Why do you not come to me? END
BEGIN NOW Your papa is going&mdash;- Dear Father Goriot, calm yourself. END
BEGIN NOW There, there, lie quietly and rest; don't worry yourself, don't think. END
BEGIN NOW I shall not see them. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW the agony of it! END
BEGIN NOW You _shall_ see them. END
BEGIN NOW Really? END
BEGIN NOW cried the old man, still wandering. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW shall I see them; I shall see them and hear their voices. END
BEGIN NOW I shall die happy. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW well, after all, I do not wish to live; I cannot stand this much longer; this pain that grows worse and worse. END
BEGIN NOW But, oh! END
BEGIN NOW to see them, to touch their dresses&mdash;ah! END
BEGIN NOW nothing but their dresses, that is very little; still, to feel something that belongs to them. END
BEGIN NOW Let me touch their hair with my fingers... their hair... His head fell back on the pillow, as if a sudden heavy blow had struck him down, but his hands groped feebly over the quilt, as if to find his daughters' hair. END
BEGIN NOW My blessing on them... he said, making an effort, my blessing... His voice died away. END
BEGIN NOW Just at that moment Bianchon came into the room. END
BEGIN NOW I met Christophe, he said; he is gone for your cab. END
BEGIN NOW Then he looked at the patient, and raised the closed eyelids with his fingers. END
BEGIN NOW The two students saw how dead and lustreless the eyes beneath had grown. END
BEGIN NOW He will not get over this, I am sure, said Bianchon. END
BEGIN NOW He felt the old man's pulse, and laid a hand over his heart. END
BEGIN NOW The machinery works still; more is the pity, in his state it would be better for him to die. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW my word, it would! END
BEGIN NOW What is the matter with you? END
BEGIN NOW You are as pale as death. END
BEGIN NOW Dear fellow, the moans and cries that I have just heard.... END
BEGIN NOW There is a God! END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW yes, yes, there is a God, and He has made a better world for us, or this world of ours would be a nightmare. END
BEGIN NOW I could have cried like a child; but this is too tragical, and I am sick at heart. END
BEGIN NOW We want a lot of things, you know; and where is the money to come from? END
BEGIN NOW Rastignac took out his watch. END
BEGIN NOW There, be quick and pawn it. END
BEGIN NOW I do not want to stop on the way to the Rue du Helder; there is not a moment to lose, I am afraid, and I must wait here till Christophe comes back. END
BEGIN NOW I have not a farthing; I shall have to pay the cabman when I get home again. END
BEGIN NOW Rastignac rushed down the stairs, and drove off to the Rue du Helder. END
BEGIN NOW The awful scene through which he had just passed quickened his imagination, and he grew fiercely indignant. END
BEGIN NOW He reached de Restaud's house only to be told by the servant that his mistress could see no one. END
BEGIN NOW But I have brought a message from her father, who is dying, Rastignac told the man. END
BEGIN NOW The Count has given us the strictest orders, sir&mdash;- If it is M. de Restaud who has given the orders, tell him that his father-in-law is dying, and that I am here, and must speak with him at once. END
BEGIN NOW The man went out. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene waited for a long while. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps her father is dying at this moment, he thought. END
BEGIN NOW Then the man came back, and Eugene followed him to the little drawing-room. END
BEGIN NOW M. de Restaud was standing before the fireless grate, and did not ask his visitor to seat himself. END
BEGIN NOW Monsieur le Comte, said Rastignac, M. Goriot, your father-in-law, is lying at the point of death in a squalid den in the Latin Quarter. END
BEGIN NOW He has not a penny to pay for firewood; he is expected to die at any moment, and keeps calling for his daughter&mdash;- I feel very little affection for M. Goriot, sir, as you probably are aware, the Count answered coolly. END
BEGIN NOW His character has been compromised in connection with de Restaud; he is the author of the misfortunes that have embittered my life and troubled my peace of mind. END
BEGIN NOW It is a matter of perfect indifference to me if he lives or dies. END
BEGIN NOW Now you know my feelings with regard to him. END
BEGIN NOW Public opinion may blame me, but I care nothing for public opinion. END
BEGIN NOW Just now I have other and much more important matters to think about than the things that fools and chatterers may say about me. END
BEGIN NOW As for de Restaud, she cannot leave the house; she is in no condition to do so. END
BEGIN NOW And, besides, I shall not allow her to leave it. END
BEGIN NOW Tell her father that as soon as she has done her duty by her husband and child she shall go to see him. END
BEGIN NOW If she has any love for her father, she can be free to go to him, if she chooses, in a few seconds; it lies entirely with her&mdash;- Monsieur le Comte, it is no business of mine to criticise your conduct; you can do as you please with your wife, but may I count upon your keeping your word with me? END
BEGIN NOW Well, then, promise me to tell her that her father has not twenty-four hours to live; that he looks in vain for her, and has cursed her already as he lies on his deathbed,&mdash;that is all I ask. END
BEGIN NOW You can tell her yourself, the Count answered, impressed by the thrill of indignation in Eugene's voice. END
BEGIN NOW The Count led the way to the room where his wife usually sat. END
BEGIN NOW She was drowned in tears, and lay crouching in the depths of an armchair, as if she were tired of life and longed to die. END
BEGIN NOW It was piteous to see her. END
BEGIN NOW Before venturing to look at Rastignac, she glanced at her husband in evident and abject terror that spoke of complete prostration of body and mind; she seemed crushed by a tyranny both mental and physical. END
BEGIN NOW The Count jerked his head towards her; she construed this as a permission to speak. END
BEGIN NOW I heard all that you said, monsieur. END
BEGIN NOW Tell my father that if he knew all he would forgive me.... END
BEGIN NOW I did not think there was such torture in the world as this; it is more than I can endure, monsieur!&mdash;But I will not give way as long as I live, she said, turning to her husband. END
BEGIN NOW I am a mother.&mdash;Tell my father that I have never sinned against him in spite of appearances! END
BEGIN NOW she cried aloud in her despair. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene bowed to the husband and wife; he guessed the meaning of the scene, and that this was a terrible crisis in the Countess' life. END
BEGIN NOW M. de Restaud's manner had told him that his errand was a fruitless one; he saw that Anastasie had no longer any liberty of action. END
BEGIN NOW He came away mazed and bewildered, and hurried to de Nucingen. END
BEGIN NOW Delphine was in bed. END
BEGIN NOW Poor dear Eugene, I am ill, she said. END
BEGIN NOW I caught cold after the ball, and I am afraid of pneumonia. END
BEGIN NOW I am waiting for the doctor to come. END
BEGIN NOW If you were at death's door, Eugene broke in, you must be carried somehow to your father. END
BEGIN NOW He is calling for you. END
BEGIN NOW If you could hear the faintest of those cries, you would not feel ill any longer. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene, I dare say my father is not quite so ill as you say; but I cannot bear to do anything that you do not approve, so I will do just as you wish. END
BEGIN NOW As for _him_, he would die of grief I know if I went out to see him and brought on a dangerous illness. END
BEGIN NOW Well, I will go as soon as I have seen the doctor.&mdash;Ah! END
BEGIN NOW she cried out, you are not wearing your watch, how is that? END
BEGIN NOW Eugene reddened. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene, Eugene! END
BEGIN NOW if you have sold it already or lost it.... Oh! END
BEGIN NOW it would be very wrong of you! END
BEGIN NOW The student bent over Delphine and said in her ear, Do you want to know? END
BEGIN NOW Very well, then, you shall know. END
BEGIN NOW Your father has nothing left to pay for the shroud that they will lay him in this evening. END
BEGIN NOW Your watch has been pawned, for I had nothing either. END
BEGIN NOW Delphine sprang out of bed, ran to her desk, and took out her purse. END
BEGIN NOW She gave it to Eugene, and rang the bell, crying: I will go, I will go at once, Eugene. END
BEGIN NOW Leave me, I will dress. END
BEGIN NOW Why, I should be an unnatural daughter! END
BEGIN NOW Go back; I will be there before you.&mdash;Therese, she called to the waiting-woman, ask M. de Nucingen to come upstairs at once and speak to me. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene was almost happy when he reached the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve; he was so glad to bring the news to the dying man that one of his daughters was coming. END
BEGIN NOW He fumbled in Delphine's purse for money, so as to dismiss the cab at once; and discovered that the young, beautiful, and wealthy woman of fashion had only seventy francs in her private purse. END
BEGIN NOW He climbed the stairs and found Bianchon supporting Goriot, while the house surgeon from the hospital was applying moxas to the patient's back&mdash;under the direction of the physician, it was the last expedient of science, and it was tried in vain. END
BEGIN NOW Can you feel them? END
BEGIN NOW asked the physician. END
BEGIN NOW But Goriot had caught sight of Rastignac, and answered, They are coming, are they not? END
BEGIN NOW There is hope yet, said the surgeon; he can speak. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, said Eugene, Delphine is coming. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW that is nothing! END
BEGIN NOW said Bianchon; he has been talking about his daughters all the time. END
BEGIN NOW He calls for them as a man impaled calls for water, they say&mdash;- We may as well give up, said the physician, addressing the surgeon. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing more can be done now; the case is hopeless. END
BEGIN NOW Bianchon and the house surgeon stretched the dying man out again on his loathsome bed. END
BEGIN NOW But the sheets ought to be changed, added the physician. END
BEGIN NOW Even if there is no hope left, something is due to human nature. END
BEGIN NOW I shall come back again, Bianchon, he said, turning to the medical student. END
BEGIN NOW If he complains again, rub some laudanum over the diaphragm. END
BEGIN NOW He went, and the house surgeon went with him. END
BEGIN NOW Come, Eugene, pluck up heart, my boy, said Bianchon, as soon as they were alone; we must set about changing his sheets, and put him into a clean shirt. END
BEGIN NOW Go and tell Sylvie to bring some sheets and come and help us to make the bed. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene went downstairs, and found Vauquer engaged in setting the table; Sylvie was helping her. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene had scarcely opened his mouth before the widow walked up to him with the acidulous sweet smile of a cautious shopkeeper who is anxious neither to lose money nor to offend a customer. END
BEGIN NOW My dear Monsieur Eugene, she said, when he had spoken, you know quite as well as I do that Father Goriot has not a brass farthing left. END
BEGIN NOW If you give out clean linen for a man who is just going to turn up his eyes, you are not likely to see your sheets again, for one is sure to be wanted to wrap him in. END
BEGIN NOW Now, you owe me a hundred and forty-four francs as it is, add forty francs for the pair of sheets, and then there are several little things, besides the candle that Sylvie will give you; altogether it will all mount up to at least two hundred francs, which is more than a poor widow like me can afford to lose. END
BEGIN NOW Lord! END
BEGIN NOW now, Monsieur Eugene, look at it fairly. END
BEGIN NOW I have lost quite enough in these five days since this run of ill-luck set in for me. END
BEGIN NOW I would rather than ten crowns that the old gentlemen had moved out as you said. END
BEGIN NOW It sets the other lodgers against the house. END
BEGIN NOW It would not take much to make me send him to the workhouse. END
BEGIN NOW In short, just put yourself in my place. END
BEGIN NOW I have to think of my establishment first, for I have my own living to make. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene hurried up to Goriot's room. END
BEGIN NOW Bianchon, he cried, the money for the watch? END
BEGIN NOW There it is on the table, or the three hundred and sixty odd francs that are left of it. END
BEGIN NOW I paid up all the old scores out of it before they let me have the things. END
BEGIN NOW The pawn ticket lies there under the money. END
BEGIN NOW Rastignac hurried downstairs. END
BEGIN NOW Here, madame he said in disgust, let us square accounts. END
BEGIN NOW M. Goriot will not stay much longer in your house, nor shall I&mdash;- Yes, he will go out feet foremost, poor old gentleman, she said, counting the francs with a half-facetious, half-lugubrious expression. END
BEGIN NOW Let us get this over, said Rastignac. END
BEGIN NOW Sylvie, look out some sheets, and go upstairs to help the gentlemen. END
BEGIN NOW You won't forget Sylvie, said Vauquer in Eugene's ear; she has been sitting up these two nights. END
BEGIN NOW As soon as Eugene's back was turned, the old woman hurried after her handmaid. END
BEGIN NOW Take the sheets that have had the sides turned into the middle, number Lord! END
BEGIN NOW they are plenty good enough for a corpse, she said in Sylvie's ear. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene, by this time, was part of the way upstairs, and did not overhear the elderly economist. END
BEGIN NOW Quick, said Bianchon, let us change his shirt. END
BEGIN NOW Hold him upright. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene went to the head of the bed and supported the dying man, while Bianchon drew off his shirt; and then Goriot made a movement as if he tried to clutch something to his breast, uttering a low inarticulate moaning the while, like some dumb animal in mortal pain. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW yes! END
BEGIN NOW cried Bianchon. END
BEGIN NOW It is the little locket and the chain made of hair that he wants; we took it off a while ago when we put the blisters on him. END
BEGIN NOW Poor fellow! END
BEGIN NOW he must have it again. END
BEGIN NOW There it lies on the chimney-piece. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene went to the chimney-piece and found the little plait of faded golden hair&mdash; Goriot's hair, no doubt. END
BEGIN NOW He read the name on the little round locket, ANASTASIE on the one side, DELPHINE on the other. END
BEGIN NOW It was the symbol of his own heart that the father always wore on his breast. END
BEGIN NOW The curls of hair inside the locket were so fine and soft that is was plain they had been taken from two childish heads. END
BEGIN NOW When the old man felt the locket once more, his chest heaved with a long deep sigh of satisfaction, like a groan. END
BEGIN NOW It was something terrible to see, for it seemed as if the last quiver of the nerves were laid bare to their eyes, the last communication of sense to the mysterious point within whence our sympathies come and whither they go. END
BEGIN NOW A delirious joy lighted up the distorted face. END
BEGIN NOW The terrific and vivid force of the feeling that had survived the power of thought made such an impression on the students, that the dying man felt their hot tears falling on him, and gave a shrill cry of delight. END
BEGIN NOW Nasie! END
BEGIN NOW Fifine! END
BEGIN NOW There is life in him yet, said Bianchon. END
BEGIN NOW What does he go on living for? END
BEGIN NOW said Sylvie. END
BEGIN NOW To suffer, answered Rastignac. END
BEGIN NOW Bianchon made a sign to his friend to follow his example, knelt down and pressed his arms under the sick man, and Rastignac on the other side did the same, so that Sylvie, standing in readiness, might draw the sheet from beneath and replace it with the one that she had brought. END
BEGIN NOW Those tears, no doubt, had misled Goriot; for he gathered up all his remaining strength in a last effort, stretched out his hands, groped for the students' heads, and as his fingers caught convulsively at their hair, they heard a faint whisper: Ah! END
BEGIN NOW my angels! END
BEGIN NOW Two words, two inarticulate murmurs, shaped into words by the soul which fled forth with them as they left his lips. END
BEGIN NOW Poor dear! END
BEGIN NOW cried Sylvie, melted by that exclamation; the expression of the great love raised for the last time to a sublime height by that most ghastly and involuntary of lies. END
BEGIN NOW The father's last breath must have been a sigh of joy, and in that sigh his whole life was summed up; he was cheated even at the last. END
BEGIN NOW They laid Father Goriot upon his wretched bed with reverent hands. END
BEGIN NOW Thenceforward there was no expression on his face, only the painful traces of the struggle between life and death that was going on in the machine; for that kind of cerebral consciousness that distinguishes between pleasure and pain in a human being was extinguished; it was only a question of time&mdash;and the mechanism itself would be destroyed. END
BEGIN NOW He will lie like this for several hours, and die so quietly at last, that we shall not know when he goes; there will be no rattle in the throat. END
BEGIN NOW The brain must be completely suffused. END
BEGIN NOW As he spoke there was a footstep on the staircase, and a young woman hastened up, panting for breath. END
BEGIN NOW She has come too late, said Rastignac. END
BEGIN NOW But it was not Delphine; it was Therese, her waiting-woman, who stood in the doorway. END
BEGIN NOW Monsieur Eugene, she said, monsieur and madame have had a terrible scene about some money that Madame (poor thing!) END
BEGIN NOW wanted for her father. END
BEGIN NOW She fainted, and the doctor came, and she had to be bled, calling out all the while, 'My father is dying; I want to see papa!' END
BEGIN NOW It was heartbreaking to hear her&mdash;- That will do, Therese. END
BEGIN NOW If she came now, it would be trouble thrown away. END
BEGIN NOW M. Goriot cannot recognize any one now. END
BEGIN NOW Poor, dear gentleman, is he as bad at that? END
BEGIN NOW said Therese. END
BEGIN NOW You don't want me now, I must go and look after my dinner; it is half-past four, remarked Sylvie. END
BEGIN NOW The next instant she all but collided with de Restaud on the landing outside. END
BEGIN NOW There was something awful and appalling in the sudden apparition of the Countess. END
BEGIN NOW She saw the bed of death by the dim light of the single candle, and her tears flowed at the sight of her father's passive features, from which the life had almost ebbed. END
BEGIN NOW Bianchon with thoughtful tact left the room. END
BEGIN NOW I could not escape soon enough, she said to Rastignac. END
BEGIN NOW The student bowed sadly in reply. END
BEGIN NOW de Restaud took her father's hand and kissed it. END
BEGIN NOW Forgive me, father! END
BEGIN NOW You used to say that my voice would call you back from the grave; ah! END
BEGIN NOW come back for one moment to bless your penitent daughter. END
BEGIN NOW Do you hear me? END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW this is fearful! END
BEGIN NOW No one on earth will ever bless me henceforth; every one hates me; no one loves me but you in all the world. END
BEGIN NOW My own children will hate me. END
BEGIN NOW Take me with you, father; I will love you, I will take care of you. END
BEGIN NOW He does not hear me\... END
BEGIN NOW I am mad... She fell on her knees, and gazed wildly at the human wreck before her. END
BEGIN NOW My cup of misery is full, she said, turning her eyes upon Eugene. END
BEGIN NOW M. de Trailles has fled, leaving enormous debts behind him, and I have found out that he was deceiving me. END
BEGIN NOW My husband will never forgive me, and I have left my fortune in his hands. END
BEGIN NOW I have lost all my illusions. END
BEGIN NOW Alas! END
BEGIN NOW I have forsaken the one heart that loved me (she pointed to her father as she spoke), and for whom? END
BEGIN NOW I have held his kindness cheap, and slighted his affection; many and many a time I have given him pain, ungrateful wretch that I am! END
BEGIN NOW He knew it, said Rastignac. END
BEGIN NOW Just then Goriot's eyelids unclosed; it was only a muscular contraction, but the Countess' sudden start of reviving hope was no less dreadful than the dying eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Is it possible that he can hear me? END
BEGIN NOW cried the Countess. END
BEGIN NOW No, she answered herself, and sat down beside the bed. END
BEGIN NOW As de Restaud seemed to wish to sit by her father, Eugene went down to take a little food. END
BEGIN NOW The boarders were already assembled. END
BEGIN NOW Well, remarked the painter, as he joined them, it seems that there is to be a death-orama upstairs. END
BEGIN NOW Charles, I think you might find something less painful to joke about, said Eugene. END
BEGIN NOW So we may not laugh here? END
BEGIN NOW returned the painter. END
BEGIN NOW What harm does it do? END
BEGIN NOW Bianchon said that the old man was quite insensible. END
BEGIN NOW Well, then, said the _employe_ from the Museum, he will die as he has lived. END
BEGIN NOW My father is dead! END
BEGIN NOW shrieked the Countess. END
BEGIN NOW The terrible cry brought Sylvie, Rastignac, and Bianchon; de Restaud had fainted away. END
BEGIN NOW When she recovered they carried her downstairs, and put her into the cab that stood waiting at the door. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene sent Therese with her, and bade the maid take the Countess to de Nucingen. END
BEGIN NOW Bianchon came down to them. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, he is dead, he said. END
BEGIN NOW Come, sit down to dinner, gentlemen, said Vauquer, or the soup will be cold. END
BEGIN NOW The two students sat down together. END
BEGIN NOW What is the next thing to be done? END
BEGIN NOW Eugene asked of Bianchon. END
BEGIN NOW I have closed his eyes and composed his limbs, said Bianchon. END
BEGIN NOW When the certificate has been officially registered at the Mayor's office, we will sew him in his winding sheet and bury him somewhere. END
BEGIN NOW What do you think we ought to do? END
BEGIN NOW He will not smell at his bread like this any more, said the painter, mimicking the old man's little trick. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, hang it all! END
BEGIN NOW cried the tutor, let Father Goriot drop, and let us have something else for a change. END
BEGIN NOW He is a standing dish, and we have had him with every sauce this hour or more. END
BEGIN NOW It is one of the privileges of the good city of Paris that anybody may be born, or live, or die there without attracting any attention whatsoever. END
BEGIN NOW Let us profit by the advantages of civilization. END
BEGIN NOW There are fifty or sixty deaths every day; if you have a mind to do it, you can sit down at any time and wail over whole hecatombs of dead in Paris. END
BEGIN NOW Father Goriot has gone off the hooks, has he? END
BEGIN NOW So much the better for him. END
BEGIN NOW If you venerate his memory, keep it to yourselves, and let the rest of us feed in peace. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, to be sure, said the widow, it is all the better for him that he is dead. END
BEGIN NOW It looks as though he had had trouble enough, poor soul, while he was alive. END
BEGIN NOW And this was all the funeral oration delivered over him who had been for Eugene the type and embodiment of Fatherhood. END
BEGIN NOW The fifteen lodgers began to talk as usual. END
BEGIN NOW When Bianchon and Eugene had satisfied their hunger, the rattle of spoons and forks, the boisterous conversation, the expressions on the faces that bespoke various degrees of want of feeling, gluttony, or indifference, everything about them made them shiver with loathing. END
BEGIN NOW They went out to find a priest to watch that night with the dead. END
BEGIN NOW It was necessary to measure their last pious cares by the scanty sum of money that remained. END
BEGIN NOW Before nine o'clock that evening the body was laid out on the bare sacking of the bedstead in the desolate room; a lighted candle stood on either side, and the priest watched at the foot. END
BEGIN NOW Rastignac made inquiries of this latter as to the expenses of the funeral, and wrote to the Baron de Nucingen and the Comte de Restaud, entreating both gentlemen to authorize their man of business to defray the charges of laying their father-in-law in the grave. END
BEGIN NOW He sent Christophe with the letters; then he went to bed, tired out, and slept. END
BEGIN NOW Next day Bianchon and Rastignac were obliged to take the certificate to the registrar themselves, and by twelve o'clock the formalities were completed. END
BEGIN NOW Two hours went by, no word came from the Count nor from the Baron; nobody appeared to act for them, and Rastignac had already been obliged to pay the priest. END
BEGIN NOW Sylvie asked ten francs for sewing the old man in his winding-sheet and making him ready for the grave, and Eugene and Bianchon calculated that they had scarcely sufficient to pay for the funeral, if nothing was forthcoming from the dead man's family. END
BEGIN NOW So it was the medical student who laid him in a pauper's coffin, despatched from Bianchon's hospital, whence he obtained it at a cheaper rate. END
BEGIN NOW Let us play those wretches a trick, said he. END
BEGIN NOW Go to the cemetery, buy a grave for five years at Pere-Lachaise, and arrange with the Church and the undertaker to have a third-class funeral. END
BEGIN NOW If the daughters and their husbands decline to repay you, you can carve this on the headstone&mdash;'_Here lies M. Goriot, father of the Comtesse de Restaud and the Baronne de Nucingen, interred at the expense of two students_.' END
BEGIN NOW Eugene took part of his friend's advice, but only after he had gone in person first to M. and de Nucingen, and then to M. and de Restaud&mdash;a fruitless errand. END
BEGIN NOW He went no further than the doorstep in either house. END
BEGIN NOW The servants had received strict orders to admit no one. END
BEGIN NOW Monsieur and Madame can see no visitors. END
BEGIN NOW They have just lost their father, and are in deep grief over their loss. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene's Parisian experience told him that it was idle to press the point. END
BEGIN NOW Something clutched strangely at his heart when he saw that it was impossible to reach Delphine. END
BEGIN NOW Sell some of your ornaments, he wrote hastily in the porter's room, so that your father may be decently laid in his last resting-place. END
BEGIN NOW He sealed the note, and begged the porter to give it to Therese for her mistress; but the man took it to the Baron de Nucingen, who flung the note into the fire. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene, having finished his errands, returned to the lodging-house about three o'clock. END
BEGIN NOW In spite of himself, the tears came into his eyes. END
BEGIN NOW The coffin, in its scanty covering of black cloth, was standing there on the pavement before the gate, on two chairs. END
BEGIN NOW A withered sprig of hyssop was soaking in the holy water bowl of silver-plated copper; there was not a soul in the street, not a passer-by had stopped to sprinkle the coffin; there was not even an attempt at a black drapery over the wicket. END
BEGIN NOW It was a pauper who lay there; no one made a pretence of mourning for him; he had neither friends nor kindred&mdash;there was no one to follow him to the grave. END
BEGIN NOW Bianchon's duties compelled him to be at the hospital, but he had left a few lines for Eugene, telling his friend about the arrangements he had made for the burial service. END
BEGIN NOW The house student's note told Rastignac that a mass was beyond their means, that the ordinary office for the dead was cheaper, and must suffice, and that he had sent word to the undertaker by Christophe. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene had scarcely finished reading Bianchon's scrawl, when he looked up and saw the little circular gold locket that contained the hair of Goriot's two daughters in Vauquer's hands. END
BEGIN NOW How dared you take it? END
BEGIN NOW he asked. END
BEGIN NOW Good Lord! END
BEGIN NOW is that to be buried along with him? END
BEGIN NOW retorted Sylvie. END
BEGIN NOW It is gold. END
BEGIN NOW Of course it shall! END
BEGIN NOW Eugene answered indignantly; he shall at any rate take one thing that may represent his daughters into the grave with him. END
BEGIN NOW When the hearse came, Eugene had the coffin carried into the house again, unscrewed the lid, and reverently laid on the old man's breast the token that recalled the days when Delphine and Anastasie were innocent little maidens, before they began to think for themselves, as he had moaned out in his agony. END
BEGIN NOW Rastignac and Christophe and the two undertaker's men were the only followers of the funeral. END
BEGIN NOW The Church of Saint-Etienne du Mont was only a little distance from the Rue Nueve-Sainte-Genevieve. END
BEGIN NOW When the coffin had been deposited in a low, dark, little chapel, the law student looked round in vain for Goriot's two daughters or their husbands. END
BEGIN NOW Christophe was his only fellow-mourner; Christophe, who appeared to think it was his duty to attend the funeral of the man who had put him in the way of such handsome tips. END
BEGIN NOW As they waited there in the chapel for the two priests, the chorister, and the beadle, Rastignac grasped Christophe's hand. END
BEGIN NOW He could not utter a word just then. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, Monsieur Eugene, said Christophe, he was a good and worthy man, who never said one word louder than another; he never did any one any harm, and gave nobody any trouble. END
BEGIN NOW The two priests, the chorister, and the beadle came, and said and did as much as could be expected for seventy francs in an age when religion cannot afford to say prayers for nothing. END
BEGIN NOW The ecclesiatics chanted a psalm, the _Libera nos_ and the _De profundis_. END
BEGIN NOW The whole service lasted about twenty minutes. END
BEGIN NOW There was but one mourning coach, which the priest and chorister agreed to share with Eugene and Christophe. END
BEGIN NOW There is no one else to follow us, remarked the priest, so we may as well go quickly, and so save time; it is half-past five. END
BEGIN NOW But just as the coffin was put in the hearse, two empty carriages, with the armorial bearings of the Comte de Restaud and the Baron de Nucingen, arrived and followed in the procession to Pere-Lachaise. END
BEGIN NOW At six o'clock Goriot's coffin was lowered into the grave, his daughters' servants standing round the while. END
BEGIN NOW The ecclesiastic recited the short prayer that the students could afford to pay for, and then both priest and lackeys disappeared at once. END
BEGIN NOW The two grave diggers flung in several spadefuls of earth, and then stopped and asked Rastignac for their fee. END
BEGIN NOW Eugene felt in vain in his pocket, and was obliged to borrow five francs of Christophe. END
BEGIN NOW This thing, so trifling in itself, gave Rastignac a terrible pang of distress. END
BEGIN NOW It was growing dusk, the damp twilight fretted his nerves; he gazed down into the grave and the tears he shed were drawn from him by the sacred emotion, a single-hearted sorrow. END
BEGIN NOW When such tears fall on earth, their radiance reaches heaven. END
BEGIN NOW And with that tear that fell on Father Goriot's grave, Eugene Rastignac's youth ended. END
BEGIN NOW He folded his arms and gazed at the clouded sky; and Christophe, after a glance at him, turned and went&mdash;Rastignac was left alone. END
BEGIN NOW He went a few paces further, to the highest point of the cemetery, and looked out over Paris and the windings of the Seine; the lamps were beginning to shine on either side of the river. END
BEGIN NOW His eyes turned almost eagerly to the space between the column of the Place Vendome and the cupola of the Invalides; there lay the shining world that he had wished to reach. END
BEGIN NOW He glanced over that humming hive, seeming to draw a foretaste of its honey, and said magniloquently: Henceforth there is war between us. END
BEGIN NOW And by way of throwing down the glove to Society, Rastignac went to dine with de Nucingen.  END
BEGIN NOW  The family of Dashwood had long been settled in Sussex. END
BEGIN NOW Their estate was large, and their residence was at Norland Park, in the centre of their property, where, for many generations, they had lived in so respectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of their surrounding acquaintance. END
BEGIN NOW The late owner of this estate was a single man, who lived to a very advanced age, and who for many years of his life, had a constant companion and housekeeper in his sister. END
BEGIN NOW But her death, which happened ten years before his own, produced a great alteration in his home; for to supply her loss, he invited and received into his house the family of his nephew Mr. Henry Dashwood, the legal inheritor of the Norland estate, and the person to whom he intended to bequeath it. END
BEGIN NOW In the society of his nephew and niece, and their children, the old Gentleman's days were comfortably spent. END
BEGIN NOW His attachment to them all increased. END
BEGIN NOW The constant attention of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Dashwood to his wishes, which proceeded not merely from interest, but from goodness of heart, gave him every degree of solid comfort which his age could receive; and the cheerfulness of the children added a relish to his existence. END
BEGIN NOW By a former marriage, Mr. Henry Dashwood had one son: by his present lady, three daughters. END
BEGIN NOW The son, a steady respectable young man, was amply provided for by the fortune of his mother, which had been large, and half of which devolved on him on his coming of age. END
BEGIN NOW By his own marriage, likewise, which happened soon afterwards, he added to his wealth. END
BEGIN NOW To him therefore the succession to the Norland estate was not so really important as to his sisters; for their fortune, independent of what might arise to them from their father's inheriting that property, could be but small. END
BEGIN NOW Their mother had nothing, and their father only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal; for the remaining moiety of his first wife's fortune was also secured to her child, and he had only a life-interest in it. END
BEGIN NOW The old gentleman died: his will was read, and like almost every other will, gave as much disappointment as pleasure. END
BEGIN NOW He was neither so unjust, nor so ungrateful, as to leave his estate from his nephew;&mdash;but he left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of the bequest. END
BEGIN NOW Mr. Dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his wife and daughters than for himself or his son;&mdash;but to his son, and his son's son, a child of four years old, it was secured, in such a way, as to leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most dear to him, and who most needed a provision by any charge on the estate, or by any sale of its valuable woods. END
BEGIN NOW The whole was tied up for the benefit of this child, who, in occasional visits with his father and mother at Norland, had so far gained on the affections of his uncle, by such attractions as are by no means unusual in children of two or three years old; an imperfect articulation, an earnest desire of having his own way, many cunning tricks, and a great deal of noise, as to outweigh all the value of all the attention which, for years, he had received from his niece and her daughters. END
BEGIN NOW He meant not to be unkind, however, and, as a mark of his affection for the three girls, he left them a thousand pounds a-piece. END
BEGIN NOW Mr. Dashwood's disappointment was, at first, severe; but his temper was cheerful and sanguine; and he might reasonably hope to live many years, and by living economically, lay by a considerable sum from the produce of an estate already large, and capable of almost immediate improvement. END
BEGIN NOW But the fortune, which had been so tardy in coming, was his only one twelvemonth. END
BEGIN NOW He survived his uncle no longer; and ten thousand pounds, including the late legacies, was all that remained for his widow and daughters. END
BEGIN NOW His son was sent for as soon as his danger was known, and to him Mr. Dashwood recommended, with all the strength and urgency which illness could command, the interest of his mother-in-law and sisters. END
BEGIN NOW Mr. John Dashwood had not the strong feelings of the rest of the family; but he was affected by a recommendation of such a nature at such a time, and he promised to do every thing in his power to make them comfortable. END
BEGIN NOW His father was rendered easy by such an assurance, and Mr. John Dashwood had then leisure to consider how much there might prudently be in his power to do for them. END
BEGIN NOW He was not an ill-disposed young man, unless to be rather cold hearted and rather selfish is to be ill-disposed: but he was, in general, well respected; for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge of his ordinary duties. END
BEGIN NOW Had he married a more amiable woman, he might have been made still more respectable than he was:&mdash;he might even have been made amiable himself; for he was very young when he married, and very fond of his wife. END
BEGIN NOW But Mrs. John Dashwood was a strong caricature of himself;&mdash;more narrow-minded and selfish. END
BEGIN NOW When he gave his promise to his father, he meditated within himself to increase the fortunes of his sisters by the present of a thousand pounds a-piece. END
BEGIN NOW He then really thought himself equal to it. END
BEGIN NOW The prospect of four thousand a-year, in addition to his present income, besides the remaining half of his own mother's fortune, warmed his heart, and made him feel capable of generosity.&mdash; Yes, he would give them three thousand pounds: it would be liberal and handsome! END
BEGIN NOW It would be enough to make them completely easy. END
BEGIN NOW Three thousand pounds! END
BEGIN NOW he could spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience. END
BEGIN NOW &mdash; He thought of it all day long, and for many days successively, and he did not repent. END
BEGIN NOW No sooner was his father's funeral over, than Mrs. John Dashwood, without sending any notice of her intention to her mother-in-law, arrived with her child and their attendants. END
BEGIN NOW No one could dispute her right to come; the house was her husband's from the moment of his father's decease; but the indelicacy of her conduct was so much the greater, and to a woman in Mrs. Dashwood's situation, with only common feelings, must have been highly unpleasing;&mdash;but in HER mind there was a sense of honor so keen, a generosity so romantic, that any offence of the kind, by whomsoever given or received, was to her a source of immovable disgust. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. John Dashwood had never been a favourite with any of her husband's family; but she had had no opportunity, till the present, of shewing them with how little attention to the comfort of other people she could act when occasion required it. END
BEGIN NOW So acutely did Mrs. Dashwood feel this ungracious behaviour, and so earnestly did she despise her daughter-in-law for it, that, on the arrival of the latter, she would have quitted the house for ever, had not the entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect on the propriety of going, and her own tender love for all her three children determined her afterwards to stay, and for their sakes avoid a breach with their brother. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor, this eldest daughter, whose advice was so effectual, possessed a strength of understanding, and coolness of judgment, which qualified her, though only nineteen, to be the counsellor of her mother, and enabled her frequently to counteract, to the advantage of them all, that eagerness of mind in Mrs. Dashwood which must generally have led to imprudence. END
BEGIN NOW She had an excellent heart;&mdash;her disposition was affectionate, and her feelings were strong; but she knew how to govern them: it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn; and which one of her sisters had resolved never to be taught. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne's abilities were, in many respects, quite equal to Elinor's. END
BEGIN NOW She was sensible and clever; but eager in everything: her sorrows, her joys, could have no moderation. END
BEGIN NOW She was generous, amiable, interesting: she was everything but prudent. END
BEGIN NOW The resemblance between her and her mother was strikingly great. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor saw, with concern, the excess of her sister's sensibility; but by Mrs. Dashwood it was valued and cherished. END
BEGIN NOW They encouraged each other now in the violence of their affliction. END
BEGIN NOW The agony of grief which overpowered them at first, was voluntarily renewed, was sought for, was created again and again. END
BEGIN NOW They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it, and resolved against ever admitting consolation in future. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor, too, was deeply afflicted; but still she could struggle, she could exert herself. END
BEGIN NOW She could consult with her brother, could receive her sister-in-law on her arrival, and treat her with proper attention; and could strive to rouse her mother to similar exertion, and encourage her to similar forbearance. END
BEGIN NOW Margaret, the other sister, was a good-humored, well-disposed girl; but as she had already imbibed a good deal of Marianne's romance, without having much of her sense, she did not, at thirteen, bid fair to equal her sisters at a more advanced period of life. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. John Dashwood now installed herself mistress of Norland; and her mother and sisters-in-law were degraded to the condition of visitors. END
BEGIN NOW As such, however, they were treated by her with quiet civility; and by her husband with as much kindness as he could feel towards anybody beyond himself, his wife, and their child. END
BEGIN NOW He really pressed them, with some earnestness, to consider Norland as their home; and, as no plan appeared so eligible to Mrs. Dashwood as remaining there till she could accommodate herself with a house in the neighbourhood, his invitation was accepted. END
BEGIN NOW A continuance in a place where everything reminded her of former delight, was exactly what suited her mind. END
BEGIN NOW In seasons of cheerfulness, no temper could be more cheerful than hers, or possess, in a greater degree, that sanguine expectation of happiness which is happiness itself. END
BEGIN NOW But in sorrow she must be equally carried away by her fancy, and as far beyond consolation as in pleasure she was beyond alloy. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. John Dashwood did not at all approve of what her husband intended to do for his sisters. END
BEGIN NOW To take three thousand pounds from the fortune of their dear little boy would be impoverishing him to the most dreadful degree. END
BEGIN NOW She begged him to think again on the subject. END
BEGIN NOW How could he answer it to himself to rob his child, and his only child too, of so large a sum? END
BEGIN NOW And what possible claim could the Miss Dashwoods, who were related to him only by half blood, which she considered as no relationship at all, have on his generosity to so large an amount. END
BEGIN NOW It was very well known that no affection was ever supposed to exist between the children of any man by different marriages; and why was he to ruin himself, and their poor little Harry, by giving away all his money to his half sisters? END
BEGIN NOW It was my father's last request to me, replied her husband, that I should assist his widow and daughters. END
BEGIN NOW He did not know what he was talking of, I dare say; ten to one but he was light-headed at the time. END
BEGIN NOW Had he been in his right senses, he could not have thought of such a thing as begging you to give away half your fortune from your own child. END
BEGIN NOW He did not stipulate for any particular sum, my dear Fanny; he only requested me, in general terms, to assist them, and make their situation more comfortable than it was in his power to do. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps it would have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself. END
BEGIN NOW He could hardly suppose I should neglect them. END
BEGIN NOW But as he required the promise, I could not do less than give it; at least I thought so at the time. END
BEGIN NOW The promise, therefore, was given, and must be performed. END
BEGIN NOW Something must be done for them whenever they leave Norland and settle in a new home. END
BEGIN NOW Well, then, LET something be done for them; but THAT something need not be three thousand pounds. END
BEGIN NOW Consider, she added, that when the money is once parted with, it never can return. END
BEGIN NOW Your sisters will marry, and it will be gone for ever. END
BEGIN NOW If, indeed, it could be restored to our poor little boy&mdash; Why, to be sure, said her husband, very gravely, that would make great difference. END
BEGIN NOW The time may come when Harry will regret that so large a sum was parted with. END
BEGIN NOW If he should have a numerous family, for instance, it would be a very convenient addition. END
BEGIN NOW To be sure it would. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps, then, it would be better for all parties, if the sum were diminished one half.&mdash;Five hundred pounds would be a prodigious increase to their fortunes! END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW beyond anything great! END
BEGIN NOW What brother on earth would do half so much for his sisters, even if REALLY his sisters! END
BEGIN NOW And as it is&mdash;only half blood!&mdash;But you have such a generous spirit! END
BEGIN NOW I would not wish to do any thing mean, he replied. END
BEGIN NOW One had rather, on such occasions, do too much than too little. END
BEGIN NOW No one, at least, can think I have not done enough for them: even themselves, they can hardly expect more. END
BEGIN NOW There is no knowing what THEY may expect, said the lady, but we are not to think of their expectations: the question is, what you can afford to do. END
BEGIN NOW Certainly&mdash;and I think I may afford to give them five hundred pounds a-piece. END
BEGIN NOW As it is, without any addition of mine, they will each have about three thousand pounds on their mother's death&mdash;a very comfortable fortune for any young woman. END
BEGIN NOW To be sure it is; and, indeed, it strikes me that they can want no addition at all. END
BEGIN NOW They will have ten thousand pounds divided amongst them. END
BEGIN NOW If they marry, they will be sure of doing well, and if they do not, they may all live very comfortably together on the interest of ten thousand pounds. END
BEGIN NOW That is very true, and, therefore, I do not know whether, upon the whole, it would not be more advisable to do something for their mother while she lives, rather than for them&mdash;something of the annuity kind I mean.&mdash;My sisters would feel the good effects of it as well as herself. END
BEGIN NOW A hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable. END
BEGIN NOW His wife hesitated a little, however, in giving her consent to this plan. END
BEGIN NOW To be sure, said she, it is better than parting with fifteen hundred pounds at once. END
BEGIN NOW But, then, if Mrs. Dashwood should live fifteen years we shall be completely taken in. END
BEGIN NOW Fifteen years! END
BEGIN NOW my dear Fanny; her life cannot be worth half that purchase. END
BEGIN NOW Certainly not; but if you observe, people always live for ever when there is an annuity to be paid them; and she is very stout and healthy, and hardly forty. END
BEGIN NOW An annuity is a very serious business; it comes over and over every year, and there is no getting rid of it. END
BEGIN NOW You are not aware of what you are doing. END
BEGIN NOW I have known a great deal of the trouble of annuities; for my mother was clogged with the payment of three to old superannuated servants by my father's will, and it is amazing how disagreeable she found it. END
BEGIN NOW Twice every year these annuities were to be paid; and then there was the trouble of getting it to them; and then one of them was said to have died, and afterwards it turned out to be no such thing. END
BEGIN NOW My mother was quite sick of it. END
BEGIN NOW Her income was not her own, she said, with such perpetual claims on it; and it was the more unkind in my father, because, otherwise, the money would have been entirely at my mother's disposal, without any restriction whatever. END
BEGIN NOW It has given me such an abhorrence of annuities, that I am sure I would not pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world. END
BEGIN NOW It is certainly an unpleasant thing, replied Mr. Dashwood, to have those kind of yearly drains on one's income. END
BEGIN NOW One's fortune, as your mother justly says, is NOT one's own. END
BEGIN NOW To be tied down to the regular payment of such a sum, on every rent day, is by no means desirable: it takes away one's independence. END
BEGIN NOW Undoubtedly; and after all you have no thanks for it. END
BEGIN NOW They think themselves secure, you do no more than what is expected, and it raises no gratitude at all. END
BEGIN NOW If I were you, whatever I did should be done at my own discretion entirely. END
BEGIN NOW I would not bind myself to allow them any thing yearly. END
BEGIN NOW It may be very inconvenient some years to spare a hundred, or even fifty pounds from our own expenses. END
BEGIN NOW I believe you are right, my love; it will be better that there should be no annuity in the case; whatever I may give them occasionally will be of far greater assistance than a yearly allowance, because they would only enlarge their style of living if they felt sure of a larger income, and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end of the year. END
BEGIN NOW It will certainly be much the best way. END
BEGIN NOW A present of fifty pounds, now and then, will prevent their ever being distressed for money, and will, I think, be amply discharging my promise to my father. END
BEGIN NOW To be sure it will. END
BEGIN NOW Indeed, to say the truth, I am convinced within myself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money at all. END
BEGIN NOW The assistance he thought of, I dare say, was only such as might be reasonably expected of you; for instance, such as looking out for a comfortable small house for them, helping them to move their things, and sending them presents of fish and game, and so forth, whenever they are in season. END
BEGIN NOW I'll lay my life that he meant nothing farther; indeed, it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did. END
BEGIN NOW Do but consider, my dear Mr. Dashwood, how excessively comfortable your mother-in-law and her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand pounds, besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls, which brings them in fifty pounds a year a-piece, and, of course, they will pay their mother for their board out of it. END
BEGIN NOW Altogether, they will have five hundred a-year amongst them, and what on earth can four women want for more than that?&mdash;They will live so cheap! END
BEGIN NOW Their housekeeping will be nothing at all. END
BEGIN NOW They will have no carriage, no horses, and hardly any servants; they will keep no company, and can have no expenses of any kind! END
BEGIN NOW Only conceive how comfortable they will be! END
BEGIN NOW Five hundred a year! END
BEGIN NOW I am sure I cannot imagine how they will spend half of it; and as to your giving them more, it is quite absurd to think of it. END
BEGIN NOW They will be much more able to give YOU something. END
BEGIN NOW Upon my word, said Mr. Dashwood, I believe you are perfectly right. END
BEGIN NOW My father certainly could mean nothing more by his request to me than what you say. END
BEGIN NOW I clearly understand it now, and I will strictly fulfil my engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness to them as you have described. END
BEGIN NOW When my mother removes into another house my services shall be readily given to accommodate her as far as I can. END
BEGIN NOW Some little present of furniture too may be acceptable then. END
BEGIN NOW Certainly, returned Mrs. John Dashwood. END
BEGIN NOW But, however, ONE thing must be considered. END
BEGIN NOW When your father and mother moved to Norland, though the furniture of Stanhill was sold, all the china, plate, and linen was saved, and is now left to your mother. END
BEGIN NOW Her house will therefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it. END
BEGIN NOW That is a material consideration undoubtedly. END
BEGIN NOW A valuable legacy indeed! END
BEGIN NOW And yet some of the plate would have been a very pleasant addition to our own stock here. END
BEGIN NOW Yes; and the set of breakfast china is twice as handsome as what belongs to this house. END
BEGIN NOW A great deal too handsome, in my opinion, for any place THEY can ever afford to live in. END
BEGIN NOW But, however, so it is. END
BEGIN NOW Your father thought only of THEM. END
BEGIN NOW And I must say this: that you owe no particular gratitude to him, nor attention to his wishes; for we very well know that if he could, he would have left almost everything in the world to THEM. END
BEGIN NOW This argument was irresistible. END
BEGIN NOW It gave to his intentions whatever of decision was wanting before; and he finally resolved, that it would be absolutely unnecessary, if not highly indecorous, to do more for the widow and children of his father, than such kind of neighbourly acts as his own wife pointed out. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Dashwood remained at Norland several months; not from any disinclination to move when the sight of every well known spot ceased to raise the violent emotion which it produced for a while; for when her spirits began to revive, and her mind became capable of some other exertion than that of heightening its affliction by melancholy remembrances, she was impatient to be gone, and indefatigable in her inquiries for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of Norland; for to remove far from that beloved spot was impossible. END
BEGIN NOW But she could hear of no situation that at once answered her notions of comfort and ease, and suited the prudence of her eldest daughter, whose steadier judgment rejected several houses as too large for their income, which her mother would have approved. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Dashwood had been informed by her husband of the solemn promise on the part of his son in their favour, which gave comfort to his last earthly reflections. END
BEGIN NOW She doubted the sincerity of this assurance no more than he had doubted it himself, and she thought of it for her daughters' sake with satisfaction, though as for herself she was persuaded that a much smaller provision than L would support her in affluence. END
BEGIN NOW For their brother's sake, too, for the sake of his own heart, she rejoiced; and she reproached herself for being unjust to his merit before, in believing him incapable of generosity. END
BEGIN NOW His attentive behaviour to herself and his sisters convinced her that their welfare was dear to him, and, for a long time, she firmly relied on the liberality of his intentions. END
BEGIN NOW The contempt which she had, very early in their acquaintance, felt for her daughter-in-law, was very much increased by the farther knowledge of her character, which half a year's residence in her family afforded; and perhaps in spite of every consideration of politeness or maternal affection on the side of the former, the two ladies might have found it impossible to have lived together so long, had not a particular circumstance occurred to give still greater eligibility, according to the opinions of Mrs. Dashwood, to her daughters' continuance at Norland. END
BEGIN NOW This circumstance was a growing attachment between her eldest girl and the brother of Mrs. John Dashwood, a gentleman-like and pleasing young man, who was introduced to their acquaintance soon after his sister's establishment at Norland, and who had since spent the greatest part of his time there. END
BEGIN NOW Some mothers might have encouraged the intimacy from motives of interest, for Edward Ferrars was the eldest son of a man who had died very rich; and some might have repressed it from motives of prudence, for, except a trifling sum, the whole of his fortune depended on the will of his mother. END
BEGIN NOW But Mrs. Dashwood was alike uninfluenced by either consideration. END
BEGIN NOW It was enough for her that he appeared to be amiable, that he loved her daughter, and that Elinor returned the partiality. END
BEGIN NOW It was contrary to every doctrine of hers that difference of fortune should keep any couple asunder who were attracted by resemblance of disposition; and that Elinor's merit should not be acknowledged by every one who knew her, was to her comprehension impossible. END
BEGIN NOW Edward Ferrars was not recommended to their good opinion by any peculiar graces of person or address. END
BEGIN NOW He was not handsome, and his manners required intimacy to make them pleasing. END
BEGIN NOW He was too diffident to do justice to himself; but when his natural shyness was overcome, his behaviour gave every indication of an open, affectionate heart. END
BEGIN NOW His understanding was good, and his education had given it solid improvement. END
BEGIN NOW But he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition to answer the wishes of his mother and sister, who longed to see him distinguished&mdash;as&mdash;they hardly knew what. END
BEGIN NOW They wanted him to make a fine figure in the world in some manner or other. END
BEGIN NOW His mother wished to interest him in political concerns, to get him into parliament, or to see him connected with some of the great men of the day. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. John Dashwood wished it likewise; but in the mean while, till one of these superior blessings could be attained, it would have quieted her ambition to see him driving a barouche. END
BEGIN NOW But Edward had no turn for great men or barouches. END
BEGIN NOW All his wishes centered in domestic comfort and the quiet of private life. END
BEGIN NOW Fortunately he had a younger brother who was more promising. END
BEGIN NOW Edward had been staying several weeks in the house before he engaged much of Mrs. Dashwood's attention; for she was, at that time, in such affliction as rendered her careless of surrounding objects. END
BEGIN NOW She saw only that he was quiet and unobtrusive, and she liked him for it. END
BEGIN NOW He did not disturb the wretchedness of her mind by ill-timed conversation. END
BEGIN NOW She was first called to observe and approve him farther, by a reflection which Elinor chanced one day to make on the difference between him and his sister. END
BEGIN NOW It was a contrast which recommended him most forcibly to her mother. END
BEGIN NOW It is enough, said she; to say that he is unlike Fanny is enough. END
BEGIN NOW It implies everything amiable. END
BEGIN NOW I love him already. END
BEGIN NOW I think you will like him, said Elinor, when you know more of him. END
BEGIN NOW Like him! END
BEGIN NOW replied her mother with a smile. END
BEGIN NOW I feel no sentiment of approbation inferior to love. END
BEGIN NOW You may esteem him. END
BEGIN NOW I have never yet known what it was to separate esteem and love. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Dashwood now took pains to get acquainted with him. END
BEGIN NOW Her manners were attaching, and soon banished his reserve. END
BEGIN NOW She speedily comprehended all his merits; the persuasion of his regard for Elinor perhaps assisted her penetration; but she really felt assured of his worth: and even that quietness of manner, which militated against all her established ideas of what a young man's address ought to be, was no longer uninteresting when she knew his heart to be warm and his temper affectionate. END
BEGIN NOW No sooner did she perceive any symptom of love in his behaviour to Elinor, than she considered their serious attachment as certain, and looked forward to their marriage as rapidly approaching. END
BEGIN NOW In a few months, my dear Marianne. END
BEGIN NOW said she, Elinor will, in all probability be settled for life. END
BEGIN NOW We shall miss her; but SHE will be happy. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW Mama, how shall we do without her? END
BEGIN NOW My love, it will be scarcely a separation. END
BEGIN NOW We shall live within a few miles of each other, and shall meet every day of our lives. END
BEGIN NOW You will gain a brother, a real, affectionate brother. END
BEGIN NOW I have the highest opinion in the world of Edward's heart. END
BEGIN NOW But you look grave, Marianne; do you disapprove your sister's choice? END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps, said Marianne, I may consider it with some surprise. END
BEGIN NOW Edward is very amiable, and I love him tenderly. END
BEGIN NOW But yet&mdash;he is not the kind of young man&mdash;there is something wanting&mdash;his figure is not striking; it has none of that grace which I should expect in the man who could seriously attach my sister. END
BEGIN NOW His eyes want all that spirit, that fire, which at once announce virtue and intelligence. END
BEGIN NOW And besides all this, I am afraid, Mama, he has no real taste. END
BEGIN NOW Music seems scarcely to attract him, and though he admires Elinor's drawings very much, it is not the admiration of a person who can understand their worth. END
BEGIN NOW It is evident, in spite of his frequent attention to her while she draws, that in fact he knows nothing of the matter. END
BEGIN NOW He admires as a lover, not as a connoisseur. END
BEGIN NOW To satisfy me, those characters must be united. END
BEGIN NOW I could not be happy with a man whose taste did not in every point coincide with my own. END
BEGIN NOW He must enter into all my feelings; the same books, the same music must charm us both. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW mama, how spiritless, how tame was Edward's manner in reading to us last night! END
BEGIN NOW I felt for my sister most severely. END
BEGIN NOW Yet she bore it with so much composure, she seemed scarcely to notice it. END
BEGIN NOW I could hardly keep my seat. END
BEGIN NOW To hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost driven me wild, pronounced with such impenetrable calmness, such dreadful indifference! END
BEGIN NOW He would certainly have done more justice to simple and elegant prose. END
BEGIN NOW I thought so at the time; but you WOULD give him Cowper. END
BEGIN NOW Nay, Mama, if he is not to be animated by Cowper!&mdash;but we must allow for difference of taste. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor has not my feelings, and therefore she may overlook it, and be happy with him. END
BEGIN NOW But it would have broke MY heart, had I loved him, to hear him read with so little sensibility. END
BEGIN NOW Mama, the more I know of the world, the more am I convinced that I shall never see a man whom I can really love. END
BEGIN NOW I require so much! END
BEGIN NOW He must have all Edward's virtues, and his person and manners must ornament his goodness with every possible charm. END
BEGIN NOW Remember, my love, that you are not seventeen. END
BEGIN NOW It is yet too early in life to despair of such a happiness. END
BEGIN NOW Why should you be less fortunate than your mother? END
BEGIN NOW In one circumstance only, my Marianne, may your destiny be different from hers! END
BEGIN NOW What a pity it is, Elinor, said Marianne, that Edward should have no taste for drawing. END
BEGIN NOW No taste for drawing! END
BEGIN NOW replied Elinor, why should you think so? END
BEGIN NOW He does not draw himself, indeed, but he has great pleasure in seeing the performances of other people, and I assure you he is by no means deficient in natural taste, though he has not had opportunities of improving it. END
BEGIN NOW Had he ever been in the way of learning, I think he would have drawn very well. END
BEGIN NOW He distrusts his own judgment in such matters so much, that he is always unwilling to give his opinion on any picture; but he has an innate propriety and simplicity of taste, which in general direct him perfectly right. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne was afraid of offending, and said no more on the subject; but the kind of approbation which Elinor described as excited in him by the drawings of other people, was very far from that rapturous delight, which, in her opinion, could alone be called taste. END
BEGIN NOW Yet, though smiling within herself at the mistake, she honoured her sister for that blind partiality to Edward which produced it. END
BEGIN NOW I hope, Marianne, continued Elinor, you do not consider him as deficient in general taste. END
BEGIN NOW Indeed, I think I may say that you cannot, for your behaviour to him is perfectly cordial, and if THAT were your opinion, I am sure you could never be civil to him. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne hardly knew what to say. END
BEGIN NOW She would not wound the feelings of her sister on any account, and yet to say what she did not believe was impossible. END
BEGIN NOW At length she replied: Do not be offended, Elinor, if my praise of him is not in every thing equal to your sense of his merits. END
BEGIN NOW I have not had so many opportunities of estimating the minuter propensities of his mind, his inclinations and tastes, as you have; but I have the highest opinion in the world of his goodness and sense. END
BEGIN NOW I think him every thing that is worthy and amiable. END
BEGIN NOW I am sure, replied Elinor, with a smile, that his dearest friends could not be dissatisfied with such commendation as that. END
BEGIN NOW I do not perceive how you could express yourself more warmly. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne was rejoiced to find her sister so easily pleased. END
BEGIN NOW Of his sense and his goodness, continued Elinor, no one can, I think, be in doubt, who has seen him often enough to engage him in unreserved conversation. END
BEGIN NOW The excellence of his understanding and his principles can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps him silent. END
BEGIN NOW You know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth. END
BEGIN NOW But of his minuter propensities, as you call them you have from peculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself. END
BEGIN NOW He and I have been at times thrown a good deal together, while you have been wholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother. END
BEGIN NOW I have seen a great deal of him, have studied his sentiments and heard his opinion on subjects of literature and taste; and, upon the whole, I venture to pronounce that his mind is well-informed, enjoyment of books exceedingly great, his imagination lively, his observation just and correct, and his taste delicate and pure. END
BEGIN NOW His abilities in every respect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person. END
BEGIN NOW At first sight, his address is certainly not striking; and his person can hardly be called handsome, till the expression of his eyes, which are uncommonly good, and the general sweetness of his countenance, is perceived. END
BEGIN NOW At present, I know him so well, that I think him really handsome; or at least, almost so. END
BEGIN NOW What say you, Marianne? END
BEGIN NOW I shall very soon think him handsome, Elinor, if I do not now. END
BEGIN NOW When you tell me to love him as a brother, I shall no more see imperfection in his face, than I now do in his heart. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor started at this declaration, and was sorry for the warmth she had been betrayed into, in speaking of him. END
BEGIN NOW She felt that Edward stood very high in her opinion. END
BEGIN NOW She believed the regard to be mutual; but she required greater certainty of it to make Marianne's conviction of their attachment agreeable to her. END
BEGIN NOW She knew that what Marianne and her mother conjectured one moment, they believed the next&mdash;that with them, to wish was to hope, and to hope was to expect. END
BEGIN NOW She tried to explain the real state of the case to her sister. END
BEGIN NOW I do not attempt to deny, said she, that I think very highly of him&mdash;that I greatly esteem, that I like him. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne here burst forth with indignation&mdash; Esteem him! END
BEGIN NOW Like him! END
BEGIN NOW Cold-hearted Elinor! END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW worse than cold-hearted! END
BEGIN NOW Ashamed of being otherwise. END
BEGIN NOW Use those words again, and I will leave the room this moment. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor could not help laughing. END
BEGIN NOW Excuse me, said she; and be assured that I meant no offence to you, by speaking, in so quiet a way, of my own feelings. END
BEGIN NOW Believe them to be stronger than I have declared; believe them, in short, to be such as his merit, and the suspicion&mdash;the hope of his affection for me may warrant, without imprudence or folly. END
BEGIN NOW But farther than this you must not believe. END
BEGIN NOW I am by no means assured of his regard for me. END
BEGIN NOW There are moments when the extent of it seems doubtful; and till his sentiments are fully known, you cannot wonder at my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality, by believing or calling it more than it is. END
BEGIN NOW In my heart I feel little&mdash;scarcely any doubt of his preference. END
BEGIN NOW But there are other points to be considered besides his inclination. END
BEGIN NOW He is very far from being independent. END
BEGIN NOW What his mother really is we cannot know; but, from Fanny's occasional mention of her conduct and opinions, we have never been disposed to think her amiable; and I am very much mistaken if Edward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in his way, if he were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a great fortune or high rank. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne was astonished to find how much the imagination of her mother and herself had outstripped the truth. END
BEGIN NOW And you really are not engaged to him! END
BEGIN NOW said she. END
BEGIN NOW Yet it certainly soon will happen. END
BEGIN NOW But two advantages will proceed from this delay. END
BEGIN NOW I shall not lose you so soon, and Edward will have greater opportunity of improving that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must be so indispensably necessary to your future felicity. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW if he should be so far stimulated by your genius as to learn to draw himself, how delightful it would be! END
BEGIN NOW Elinor had given her real opinion to her sister. END
BEGIN NOW She could not consider her partiality for Edward in so prosperous a state as Marianne had believed it. END
BEGIN NOW There was, at times, a want of spirits about him which, if it did not denote indifference, spoke of something almost as unpromising. END
BEGIN NOW A doubt of her regard, supposing him to feel it, need not give him more than inquietude. END
BEGIN NOW It would not be likely to produce that dejection of mind which frequently attended him. END
BEGIN NOW A more reasonable cause might be found in the dependent situation which forbade the indulgence of his affection. END
BEGIN NOW She knew that his mother neither behaved to him so as to make his home comfortable at present, nor to give him any assurance that he might form a home for himself, without strictly attending to her views for his aggrandizement. END
BEGIN NOW With such a knowledge as this, it was impossible for Elinor to feel easy on the subject. END
BEGIN NOW She was far from depending on that result of his preference of her, which her mother and sister still considered as certain. END
BEGIN NOW Nay, the longer they were together the more doubtful seemed the nature of his regard; and sometimes, for a few painful minutes, she believed it to be no more than friendship. END
BEGIN NOW But, whatever might really be its limits, it was enough, when perceived by his sister, to make her uneasy, and at the same time, (which was still more common,) to make her uncivil. END
BEGIN NOW She took the first opportunity of affronting her mother-in-law on the occasion, talking to her so expressively of her brother's great expectations, of Mrs. Ferrars's resolution that both her sons should marry well, and of the danger attending any young woman who attempted to DRAW HIM IN; that Mrs. Dashwood could neither pretend to be unconscious, nor endeavor to be calm. END
BEGIN NOW She gave her an answer which marked her contempt, and instantly left the room, resolving that, whatever might be the inconvenience or expense of so sudden a removal, her beloved Elinor should not be exposed another week to such insinuations. END
BEGIN NOW In this state of her spirits, a letter was delivered to her from the post, which contained a proposal particularly well timed. END
BEGIN NOW It was the offer of a small house, on very easy terms, belonging to a relation of her own, a gentleman of consequence and property in Devonshire. END
BEGIN NOW The letter was from this gentleman himself, and written in the true spirit of friendly accommodation. END
BEGIN NOW He understood that she was in need of a dwelling; and though the house he now offered her was merely a cottage, he assured her that everything should be done to it which she might think necessary, if the situation pleased her. END
BEGIN NOW He earnestly pressed her, after giving the particulars of the house and garden, to come with her daughters to Barton Park, the place of his own residence, from whence she might judge, herself, whether Barton Cottage, for the houses were in the same parish, could, by any alteration, be made comfortable to her. END
BEGIN NOW He seemed really anxious to accommodate them and the whole of his letter was written in so friendly a style as could not fail of giving pleasure to his cousin; more especially at a moment when she was suffering under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of her nearer connections. END
BEGIN NOW She needed no time for deliberation or inquiry. END
BEGIN NOW Her resolution was formed as she read. END
BEGIN NOW The situation of Barton, in a county so far distant from Sussex as Devonshire, which, but a few hours before, would have been a sufficient objection to outweigh every possible advantage belonging to the place, was now its first recommendation. END
BEGIN NOW To quit the neighbourhood of Norland was no longer an evil; it was an object of desire; it was a blessing, in comparison of the misery of continuing her daughter-in-law's guest; and to remove for ever from that beloved place would be less painful than to inhabit or visit it while such a woman was its mistress. END
BEGIN NOW She instantly wrote Sir John Middleton her acknowledgment of his kindness, and her acceptance of his proposal; and then hastened to shew both letters to her daughters, that she might be secure of their approbation before her answer were sent. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor had always thought it would be more prudent for them to settle at some distance from Norland, than immediately amongst their present acquaintance. END
BEGIN NOW On THAT head, therefore, it was not for her to oppose her mother's intention of removing into Devonshire. END
BEGIN NOW The house, too, as described by Sir John, was on so simple a scale, and the rent so uncommonly moderate, as to leave her no right of objection on either point; and, therefore, though it was not a plan which brought any charm to her fancy, though it was a removal from the vicinity of Norland beyond her wishes, she made no attempt to dissuade her mother from sending a letter of acquiescence. END
BEGIN NOW No sooner was her answer dispatched, than Mrs. Dashwood indulged herself in the pleasure of announcing to her son-in-law and his wife that she was provided with a house, and should incommode them no longer than till every thing were ready for her inhabiting it. END
BEGIN NOW They heard her with surprise. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. John Dashwood said nothing; but her husband civilly hoped that she would not be settled far from Norland. END
BEGIN NOW She had great satisfaction in replying that she was going into Devonshire.&mdash;Edward turned hastily towards her, on hearing this, and, in a voice of surprise and concern, which required no explanation to her, repeated, Devonshire! END
BEGIN NOW Are you, indeed, going there? END
BEGIN NOW So far from hence! END
BEGIN NOW And to what part of it? END
BEGIN NOW She explained the situation. END
BEGIN NOW It was within four miles northward of Exeter. END
BEGIN NOW It is but a cottage, she continued, but I hope to see many of my friends in it. END
BEGIN NOW A room or two can easily be added; and if my friends find no difficulty in travelling so far to see me, I am sure I will find none in accommodating them. END
BEGIN NOW She concluded with a very kind invitation to Mr. and Mrs. John Dashwood to visit her at Barton; and to Edward she gave one with still greater affection. END
BEGIN NOW Though her late conversation with her daughter-in-law had made her resolve on remaining at Norland no longer than was unavoidable, it had not produced the smallest effect on her in that point to which it principally tended. END
BEGIN NOW To separate Edward and Elinor was as far from being her object as ever; and she wished to show Mrs. John Dashwood, by this pointed invitation to her brother, how totally she disregarded her disapprobation of the match. END
BEGIN NOW Mr. John Dashwood told his mother again and again how exceedingly sorry he was that she had taken a house at such a distance from Norland as to prevent his being of any service to her in removing her furniture. END
BEGIN NOW He really felt conscientiously vexed on the occasion; for the very exertion to which he had limited the performance of his promise to his father was by this arrangement rendered impracticable.&mdash; The furniture was all sent around by water. END
BEGIN NOW It chiefly consisted of household linen, plate, china, and books, with a handsome pianoforte of Marianne's. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. John Dashwood saw the packages depart with a sigh: she could not help feeling it hard that as Mrs. Dashwood's income would be so trifling in comparison with their own, she should have any handsome article of furniture. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth; it was ready furnished, and she might have immediate possession. END
BEGIN NOW No difficulty arose on either side in the agreement; and she waited only for the disposal of her effects at Norland, and to determine her future household, before she set off for the west; and this, as she was exceedingly rapid in the performance of everything that interested her, was soon done.&mdash;The horses which were left her by her husband had been sold soon after his death, and an opportunity now offering of disposing of her carriage, she agreed to sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her eldest daughter. END
BEGIN NOW For the comfort of her children, had she consulted only her own wishes, she would have kept it; but the discretion of Elinor prevailed. END
BEGIN NOW HER wisdom too limited the number of their servants to three; two maids and a man, with whom they were speedily provided from amongst those who had formed their establishment at Norland. END
BEGIN NOW The man and one of the maids were sent off immediately into Devonshire, to prepare the house for their mistress's arrival; for as Lady Middleton was entirely unknown to Mrs. Dashwood, she preferred going directly to the cottage to being a visitor at Barton Park; and she relied so undoubtingly on Sir John's description of the house, as to feel no curiosity to examine it herself till she entered it as her own. END
BEGIN NOW Her eagerness to be gone from Norland was preserved from diminution by the evident satisfaction of her daughter-in-law in the prospect of her removal; a satisfaction which was but feebly attempted to be concealed under a cold invitation to her to defer her departure. END
BEGIN NOW Now was the time when her son-in-law's promise to his father might with particular propriety be fulfilled. END
BEGIN NOW Since he had neglected to do it on first coming to the estate, their quitting his house might be looked on as the most suitable period for its accomplishment. END
BEGIN NOW But Mrs. Dashwood began shortly to give over every hope of the kind, and to be convinced, from the general drift of his discourse, that his assistance extended no farther than their maintenance for six months at Norland. END
BEGIN NOW He so frequently talked of the increasing expenses of housekeeping, and of the perpetual demands upon his purse, which a man of any consequence in the world was beyond calculation exposed to, that he seemed rather to stand in need of more money himself than to have any design of giving money away. END
BEGIN NOW In a very few weeks from the day which brought Sir John Middleton's first letter to Norland, every thing was so far settled in their future abode as to enable Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters to begin their journey. END
BEGIN NOW Many were the tears shed by them in their last adieus to a place so much beloved. END
BEGIN NOW Dear, dear Norland! END
BEGIN NOW said Marianne, as she wandered alone before the house, on the last evening of their being there; when shall I cease to regret you!&mdash;when learn to feel a home elsewhere!&mdash;Oh! END
BEGIN NOW happy house, could you know what I suffer in now viewing you from this spot, from whence perhaps I may view you no more!&mdash;And you, ye well-known trees!&mdash;but you will continue the same.&mdash;No leaf will decay because we are removed, nor any branch become motionless although we can observe you no longer!&mdash;No; you will continue the same; unconscious of the pleasure or the regret you occasion, and insensible of any change in those who walk under your shade!&mdash;But who will remain to enjoy you? END
BEGIN NOW The first part of their journey was performed in too melancholy a disposition to be otherwise than tedious and unpleasant. END
BEGIN NOW But as they drew towards the end of it, their interest in the appearance of a country which they were to inhabit overcame their dejection, and a view of Barton Valley as they entered it gave them cheerfulness. END
BEGIN NOW It was a pleasant fertile spot, well wooded, and rich in pasture. END
BEGIN NOW After winding along it for more than a mile, they reached their own house. END
BEGIN NOW A small green court was the whole of its demesne in front; and a neat wicket gate admitted them into it. END
BEGIN NOW As a house, Barton Cottage, though small, was comfortable and compact; but as a cottage it was defective, for the building was regular, the roof was tiled, the window shutters were not painted green, nor were the walls covered with honeysuckles. END
BEGIN NOW A narrow passage led directly through the house into the garden behind. END
BEGIN NOW On each side of the entrance was a sitting room, about sixteen feet square; and beyond them were the offices and the stairs. END
BEGIN NOW Four bed-rooms and two garrets formed the rest of the house. END
BEGIN NOW It had not been built many years and was in good repair. END
BEGIN NOW In comparison of Norland, it was poor and small indeed!&mdash;but the tears which recollection called forth as they entered the house were soon dried away. END
BEGIN NOW They were cheered by the joy of the servants on their arrival, and each for the sake of the others resolved to appear happy. END
BEGIN NOW It was very early in September; the season was fine, and from first seeing the place under the advantage of good weather, they received an impression in its favour which was of material service in recommending it to their lasting approbation. END
BEGIN NOW The situation of the house was good. END
BEGIN NOW High hills rose immediately behind, and at no great distance on each side; some of which were open downs, the others cultivated and woody. END
BEGIN NOW The village of Barton was chiefly on one of these hills, and formed a pleasant view from the cottage windows. END
BEGIN NOW The prospect in front was more extensive; it commanded the whole of the valley, and reached into the country beyond. END
BEGIN NOW The hills which surrounded the cottage terminated the valley in that direction; under another name, and in another course, it branched out again between two of the steepest of them. END
BEGIN NOW With the size and furniture of the house Mrs. Dashwood was upon the whole well satisfied; for though her former style of life rendered many additions to the latter indispensable, yet to add and improve was a delight to her; and she had at this time ready money enough to supply all that was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments. END
BEGIN NOW As for the house itself, to be sure, said she, it is too small for our family, but we will make ourselves tolerably comfortable for the present, as it is too late in the year for improvements. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps in the spring, if I have plenty of money, as I dare say I shall, we may think about building. END
BEGIN NOW These parlors are both too small for such parties of our friends as I hope to see often collected here; and I have some thoughts of throwing the passage into one of them with perhaps a part of the other, and so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance; this, with a new drawing room which may be easily added, and a bed-chamber and garret above, will make it a very snug little cottage. END
BEGIN NOW I could wish the stairs were handsome. END
BEGIN NOW But one must not expect every thing; though I suppose it would be no difficult matter to widen them. END
BEGIN NOW I shall see how much I am before-hand with the world in the spring, and we will plan our improvements accordingly. END
BEGIN NOW In the mean time, till all these alterations could be made from the savings of an income of five hundred a-year by a woman who never saved in her life, they were wise enough to be contented with the house as it was; and each of them was busy in arranging their particular concerns, and endeavoring, by placing around them books and other possessions, to form themselves a home. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne's pianoforte was unpacked and properly disposed of; and Elinor's drawings were affixed to the walls of their sitting room. END
BEGIN NOW In such employments as these they were interrupted soon after breakfast the next day by the entrance of their landlord, who called to welcome them to Barton, and to offer them every accommodation from his own house and garden in which theirs might at present be deficient. END
BEGIN NOW Sir John Middleton was a good looking man about forty. END
BEGIN NOW He had formerly visited at Stanhill, but it was too long for his young cousins to remember him. END
BEGIN NOW His countenance was thoroughly good-humoured; and his manners were as friendly as the style of his letter. END
BEGIN NOW Their arrival seemed to afford him real satisfaction, and their comfort to be an object of real solicitude to him. END
BEGIN NOW He said much of his earnest desire of their living in the most sociable terms with his family, and pressed them so cordially to dine at Barton Park every day till they were better settled at home, that, though his entreaties were carried to a point of perseverance beyond civility, they could not give offence. END
BEGIN NOW His kindness was not confined to words; for within an hour after he left them, a large basket full of garden stuff and fruit arrived from the park, which was followed before the end of the day by a present of game. END
BEGIN NOW He insisted, moreover, on conveying all their letters to and from the post for them, and would not be denied the satisfaction of sending them his newspaper every day. END
BEGIN NOW Lady Middleton had sent a very civil message by him, denoting her intention of waiting on Mrs. Dashwood as soon as she could be assured that her visit would be no inconvenience; and as this message was answered by an invitation equally polite, her ladyship was introduced to them the next day. END
BEGIN NOW They were, of course, very anxious to see a person on whom so much of their comfort at Barton must depend; and the elegance of her appearance was favourable to their wishes. END
BEGIN NOW Lady Middleton was not more than six or seven and twenty; her face was handsome, her figure tall and striking, and her address graceful. END
BEGIN NOW Her manners had all the elegance which her husband's wanted. END
BEGIN NOW But they would have been improved by some share of his frankness and warmth; and her visit was long enough to detract something from their first admiration, by shewing that, though perfectly well-bred, she was reserved, cold, and had nothing to say for herself beyond the most common-place inquiry or remark. END
BEGIN NOW Conversation however was not wanted, for Sir John was very chatty, and Lady Middleton had taken the wise precaution of bringing with her their eldest child, a fine little boy about six years old, by which means there was one subject always to be recurred to by the ladies in case of extremity, for they had to enquire his name and age, admire his beauty, and ask him questions which his mother answered for him, while he hung about her and held down his head, to the great surprise of her ladyship, who wondered at his being so shy before company, as he could make noise enough at home. END
BEGIN NOW On every formal visit a child ought to be of the party, by way of provision for discourse. END
BEGIN NOW In the present case it took up ten minutes to determine whether the boy were most like his father or mother, and in what particular he resembled either, for of course every body differed, and every body was astonished at the opinion of the others. END
BEGIN NOW An opportunity was soon to be given to the Dashwoods of debating on the rest of the children, as Sir John would not leave the house without securing their promise of dining at the park the next day. END
BEGIN NOW Barton Park was about half a mile from the cottage. END
BEGIN NOW The ladies had passed near it in their way along the valley, but it was screened from their view at home by the projection of a hill. END
BEGIN NOW The house was large and handsome; and the Middletons lived in a style of equal hospitality and elegance. END
BEGIN NOW The former was for Sir John's gratification, the latter for that of his lady. END
BEGIN NOW They were scarcely ever without some friends staying with them in the house, and they kept more company of every kind than any other family in the neighbourhood. END
BEGIN NOW It was necessary to the happiness of both; for however dissimilar in temper and outward behaviour, they strongly resembled each other in that total want of talent and taste which confined their employments, unconnected with such as society produced, within a very narrow compass. END
BEGIN NOW Sir John was a sportsman, Lady Middleton a mother. END
BEGIN NOW He hunted and shot, and she humoured her children; and these were their only resources. END
BEGIN NOW Lady Middleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her children all the year round, while Sir John's independent employments were in existence only half the time. END
BEGIN NOW Continual engagements at home and abroad, however, supplied all the deficiencies of nature and education; supported the good spirits of Sir John, and gave exercise to the good breeding of his wife. END
BEGIN NOW Lady Middleton piqued herself upon the elegance of her table, and of all her domestic arrangements; and from this kind of vanity was her greatest enjoyment in any of their parties. END
BEGIN NOW But Sir John's satisfaction in society was much more real; he delighted in collecting about him more young people than his house would hold, and the noisier they were the better was he pleased. END
BEGIN NOW He was a blessing to all the juvenile part of the neighbourhood, for in summer he was for ever forming parties to eat cold ham and chicken out of doors, and in winter his private balls were numerous enough for any young lady who was not suffering under the unsatiable appetite of fifteen. END
BEGIN NOW The arrival of a new family in the country was always a matter of joy to him, and in every point of view he was charmed with the inhabitants he had now procured for his cottage at Barton. END
BEGIN NOW The Miss Dashwoods were young, pretty, and unaffected. END
BEGIN NOW It was enough to secure his good opinion; for to be unaffected was all that a pretty girl could want to make her mind as captivating as her person. END
BEGIN NOW The friendliness of his disposition made him happy in accommodating those, whose situation might be considered, in comparison with the past, as unfortunate. END
BEGIN NOW In showing kindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfaction of a good heart; and in settling a family of females only in his cottage, he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman; for a sportsman, though he esteems only those of his sex who are sportsmen likewise, is not often desirous of encouraging their taste by admitting them to a residence within his own manor. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters were met at the door of the house by Sir John, who welcomed them to Barton Park with unaffected sincerity; and as he attended them to the drawing room repeated to the young ladies the concern which the same subject had drawn from him the day before, at being unable to get any smart young men to meet them. END
BEGIN NOW They would see, he said, only one gentleman there besides himself; a particular friend who was staying at the park, but who was neither very young nor very gay. END
BEGIN NOW He hoped they would all excuse the smallness of the party, and could assure them it should never happen so again. END
BEGIN NOW He had been to several families that morning in hopes of procuring some addition to their number, but it was moonlight and every body was full of engagements. END
BEGIN NOW Luckily Lady Middleton's mother had arrived at Barton within the last hour, and as she was a very cheerful agreeable woman, he hoped the young ladies would not find it so very dull as they might imagine. END
BEGIN NOW The young ladies, as well as their mother, were perfectly satisfied with having two entire strangers of the party, and wished for no more. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Jennings, Lady Middleton's mother, was a good-humoured, merry, fat, elderly woman, who talked a great deal, seemed very happy, and rather vulgar. END
BEGIN NOW She was full of jokes and laughter, and before dinner was over had said many witty things on the subject of lovers and husbands; hoped they had not left their hearts behind them in Sussex, and pretended to see them blush whether they did or not. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne was vexed at it for her sister's sake, and turned her eyes towards Elinor to see how she bore these attacks, with an earnestness which gave Elinor far more pain than could arise from such common-place raillery as Mrs. Jennings's. END
BEGIN NOW Colonel Brandon, the friend of Sir John, seemed no more adapted by resemblance of manner to be his friend, than Lady Middleton was to be his wife, or Mrs. Jennings to be Lady Middleton's mother. END
BEGIN NOW He was silent and grave. END
BEGIN NOW His appearance however was not unpleasing, in spite of his being in the opinion of Marianne and Margaret an absolute old bachelor, for he was on the wrong side of five and thirty; but though his face was not handsome, his countenance was sensible, and his address was particularly gentlemanlike. END
BEGIN NOW There was nothing in any of the party which could recommend them as companions to the Dashwoods; but the cold insipidity of Lady Middleton was so particularly repulsive, that in comparison of it the gravity of Colonel Brandon, and even the boisterous mirth of Sir John and his mother-in-law was interesting. END
BEGIN NOW Lady Middleton seemed to be roused to enjoyment only by the entrance of her four noisy children after dinner, who pulled her about, tore her clothes, and put an end to every kind of discourse except what related to themselves. END
BEGIN NOW In the evening, as Marianne was discovered to be musical, she was invited to play. END
BEGIN NOW The instrument was unlocked, every body prepared to be charmed, and Marianne, who sang very well, at their request went through the chief of the songs which Lady Middleton had brought into the family on her marriage, and which perhaps had lain ever since in the same position on the pianoforte, for her ladyship had celebrated that event by giving up music, although by her mother's account, she had played extremely well, and by her own was very fond of it. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne's performance was highly applauded. END
BEGIN NOW Sir John was loud in his admiration at the end of every song, and as loud in his conversation with the others while every song lasted. END
BEGIN NOW Lady Middleton frequently called him to order, wondered how any one's attention could be diverted from music for a moment, and asked Marianne to sing a particular song which Marianne had just finished. END
BEGIN NOW Colonel Brandon alone, of all the party, heard her without being in raptures. END
BEGIN NOW He paid her only the compliment of attention; and she felt a respect for him on the occasion, which the others had reasonably forfeited by their shameless want of taste. END
BEGIN NOW His pleasure in music, though it amounted not to that ecstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own, was estimable when contrasted against the horrible insensibility of the others; and she was reasonable enough to allow that a man of five and thirty might well have outlived all acuteness of feeling and every exquisite power of enjoyment. END
BEGIN NOW She was perfectly disposed to make every allowance for the colonel's advanced state of life which humanity required. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Jennings was a widow with an ample jointure. END
BEGIN NOW She had only two daughters, both of whom she had lived to see respectably married, and she had now therefore nothing to do but to marry all the rest of the world. END
BEGIN NOW In the promotion of this object she was zealously active, as far as her ability reached; and missed no opportunity of projecting weddings among all the young people of her acquaintance. END
BEGIN NOW She was remarkably quick in the discovery of attachments, and had enjoyed the advantage of raising the blushes and the vanity of many a young lady by insinuations of her power over such a young man; and this kind of discernment enabled her soon after her arrival at Barton decisively to pronounce that Colonel Brandon was very much in love with Marianne Dashwood. END
BEGIN NOW She rather suspected it to be so, on the very first evening of their being together, from his listening so attentively while she sang to them; and when the visit was returned by the Middletons' dining at the cottage, the fact was ascertained by his listening to her again. END
BEGIN NOW It must be so. END
BEGIN NOW She was perfectly convinced of it. END
BEGIN NOW It would be an excellent match, for HE was rich, and SHE was handsome. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Jennings had been anxious to see Colonel Brandon well married, ever since her connection with Sir John first brought him to her knowledge; and she was always anxious to get a good husband for every pretty girl. END
BEGIN NOW The immediate advantage to herself was by no means inconsiderable, for it supplied her with endless jokes against them both. END
BEGIN NOW At the park she laughed at the colonel, and in the cottage at Marianne. END
BEGIN NOW To the former her raillery was probably, as far as it regarded only himself, perfectly indifferent; but to the latter it was at first incomprehensible; and when its object was understood, she hardly knew whether most to laugh at its absurdity, or censure its impertinence, for she considered it as an unfeeling reflection on the colonel's advanced years, and on his forlorn condition as an old bachelor. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Dashwood, who could not think a man five years younger than herself, so exceedingly ancient as he appeared to the youthful fancy of her daughter, ventured to clear Mrs. Jennings from the probability of wishing to throw ridicule on his age. END
BEGIN NOW But at least, Mama, you cannot deny the absurdity of the accusation, though you may not think it intentionally ill-natured. END
BEGIN NOW Colonel Brandon is certainly younger than Mrs. Jennings, but he is old enough to be MY father; and if he were ever animated enough to be in love, must have long outlived every sensation of the kind. END
BEGIN NOW It is too ridiculous! END
BEGIN NOW When is a man to be safe from such wit, if age and infirmity will not protect him? END
BEGIN NOW Infirmity! END
BEGIN NOW said Elinor, do you call Colonel Brandon infirm? END
BEGIN NOW I can easily suppose that his age may appear much greater to you than to my mother; but you can hardly deceive yourself as to his having the use of his limbs! END
BEGIN NOW Did not you hear him complain of the rheumatism? END
BEGIN NOW and is not that the commonest infirmity of declining life? END
BEGIN NOW My dearest child, said her mother, laughing, at this rate you must be in continual terror of MY decay; and it must seem to you a miracle that my life has been extended to the advanced age of forty. END
BEGIN NOW Mama, you are not doing me justice. END
BEGIN NOW I know very well that Colonel Brandon is not old enough to make his friends yet apprehensive of losing him in the course of nature. END
BEGIN NOW He may live twenty years longer. END
BEGIN NOW But thirty-five has nothing to do with matrimony. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps, said Elinor, thirty-five and seventeen had better not have any thing to do with matrimony together. END
BEGIN NOW But if there should by any chance happen to be a woman who is single at seven and twenty, I should not think Colonel Brandon's being thirty-five any objection to his marrying HER. END
BEGIN NOW A woman of seven and twenty, said Marianne, after pausing a moment, can never hope to feel or inspire affection again, and if her home be uncomfortable, or her fortune small, I can suppose that she might bring herself to submit to the offices of a nurse, for the sake of the provision and security of a wife. END
BEGIN NOW In his marrying such a woman therefore there would be nothing unsuitable. END
BEGIN NOW It would be a compact of convenience, and the world would be satisfied. END
BEGIN NOW In my eyes it would be no marriage at all, but that would be nothing. END
BEGIN NOW To me it would seem only a commercial exchange, in which each wished to be benefited at the expense of the other. END
BEGIN NOW It would be impossible, I know, replied Elinor, to convince you that a woman of seven and twenty could feel for a man of thirty-five anything near enough to love, to make him a desirable companion to her. END
BEGIN NOW But I must object to your dooming Colonel Brandon and his wife to the constant confinement of a sick chamber, merely because he chanced to complain yesterday (a very cold damp day) of a slight rheumatic feel in one of his shoulders. END
BEGIN NOW But he talked of flannel waistcoats, said Marianne; and with me a flannel waistcoat is invariably connected with aches, cramps, rheumatisms, and every species of ailment that can afflict the old and the feeble. END
BEGIN NOW Had he been only in a violent fever, you would not have despised him half so much. END
BEGIN NOW Confess, Marianne, is not there something interesting to you in the flushed cheek, hollow eye, and quick pulse of a fever? END
BEGIN NOW Soon after this, upon Elinor's leaving the room, Mama, said Marianne, I have an alarm on the subject of illness which I cannot conceal from you. END
BEGIN NOW I am sure Edward Ferrars is not well. END
BEGIN NOW We have now been here almost a fortnight, and yet he does not come. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing but real indisposition could occasion this extraordinary delay. END
BEGIN NOW What else can detain him at Norland? END
BEGIN NOW Had you any idea of his coming so soon? END
BEGIN NOW said Mrs. Dashwood. END
BEGIN NOW I had none. END
BEGIN NOW On the contrary, if I have felt any anxiety at all on the subject, it has been in recollecting that he sometimes showed a want of pleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation, when I talked of his coming to Barton. END
BEGIN NOW Does Elinor expect him already? END
BEGIN NOW I have never mentioned it to her, but of course she must. END
BEGIN NOW I rather think you are mistaken, for when I was talking to her yesterday of getting a new grate for the spare bedchamber, she observed that there was no immediate hurry for it, as it was not likely that the room would be wanted for some time. END
BEGIN NOW How strange this is! END
BEGIN NOW what can be the meaning of it! END
BEGIN NOW But the whole of their behaviour to each other has been unaccountable! END
BEGIN NOW How cold, how composed were their last adieus! END
BEGIN NOW How languid their conversation the last evening of their being together! END
BEGIN NOW In Edward's farewell there was no distinction between Elinor and me: it was the good wishes of an affectionate brother to both. END
BEGIN NOW Twice did I leave them purposely together in the course of the last morning, and each time did he most unaccountably follow me out of the room. END
BEGIN NOW And Elinor, in quitting Norland and Edward, cried not as I did. END
BEGIN NOW Even now her self-command is invariable. END
BEGIN NOW When is she dejected or melancholy? END
BEGIN NOW When does she try to avoid society, or appear restless and dissatisfied in it? END
BEGIN NOW The Dashwoods were now settled at Barton with tolerable comfort to themselves. END
BEGIN NOW The house and the garden, with all the objects surrounding them, were now become familiar, and the ordinary pursuits which had given to Norland half its charms were engaged in again with far greater enjoyment than Norland had been able to afford, since the loss of their father. END
BEGIN NOW Sir John Middleton, who called on them every day for the first fortnight, and who was not in the habit of seeing much occupation at home, could not conceal his amazement on finding them always employed. END
BEGIN NOW Their visitors, except those from Barton Park, were not many; for, in spite of Sir John's urgent entreaties that they would mix more in the neighbourhood, and repeated assurances of his carriage being always at their service, the independence of Mrs. Dashwood's spirit overcame the wish of society for her children; and she was resolute in declining to visit any family beyond the distance of a walk. END
BEGIN NOW There were but few who could be so classed; and it was not all of them that were attainable. END
BEGIN NOW About a mile and a half from the cottage, along the narrow winding valley of Allenham, which issued from that of Barton, as formerly described, the girls had, in one of their earliest walks, discovered an ancient respectable looking mansion which, by reminding them a little of Norland, interested their imagination and made them wish to be better acquainted with it. END
BEGIN NOW But they learnt, on enquiry, that its possessor, an elderly lady of very good character, was unfortunately too infirm to mix with the world, and never stirred from home. END
BEGIN NOW The whole country about them abounded in beautiful walks. END
BEGIN NOW The high downs which invited them from almost every window of the cottage to seek the exquisite enjoyment of air on their summits, were a happy alternative when the dirt of the valleys beneath shut up their superior beauties; and towards one of these hills did Marianne and Margaret one memorable morning direct their steps, attracted by the partial sunshine of a showery sky, and unable longer to bear the confinement which the settled rain of the two preceding days had occasioned. END
BEGIN NOW The weather was not tempting enough to draw the two others from their pencil and their book, in spite of Marianne's declaration that the day would be lastingly fair, and that every threatening cloud would be drawn off from their hills; and the two girls set off together. END
BEGIN NOW They gaily ascended the downs, rejoicing in their own penetration at every glimpse of blue sky; and when they caught in their faces the animating gales of a high south-westerly wind, they pitied the fears which had prevented their mother and Elinor from sharing such delightful sensations. END
BEGIN NOW Is there a felicity in the world, said Marianne, superior to this?&mdash;Margaret, we will walk here at least two hours. END
BEGIN NOW Margaret agreed, and they pursued their way against the wind, resisting it with laughing delight for about twenty minutes longer, when suddenly the clouds united over their heads, and a driving rain set full in their face.&mdash; Chagrined and surprised, they were obliged, though unwillingly, to turn back, for no shelter was nearer than their own house. END
BEGIN NOW One consolation however remained for them, to which the exigence of the moment gave more than usual propriety; it was that of running with all possible speed down the steep side of the hill which led immediately to their garden gate. END
BEGIN NOW They set off. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne had at first the advantage, but a false step brought her suddenly to the ground; and Margaret, unable to stop herself to assist her, was involuntarily hurried along, and reached the bottom in safety. END
BEGIN NOW A gentleman carrying a gun, with two pointers playing round him, was passing up the hill and within a few yards of Marianne, when her accident happened. END
BEGIN NOW He put down his gun and ran to her assistance. END
BEGIN NOW She had raised herself from the ground, but her foot had been twisted in her fall, and she was scarcely able to stand. END
BEGIN NOW The gentleman offered his services; and perceiving that her modesty declined what her situation rendered necessary, took her up in his arms without farther delay, and carried her down the hill. END
BEGIN NOW Then passing through the garden, the gate of which had been left open by Margaret, he bore her directly into the house, whither Margaret was just arrived, and quitted not his hold till he had seated her in a chair in the parlour. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor and her mother rose up in amazement at their entrance, and while the eyes of both were fixed on him with an evident wonder and a secret admiration which equally sprung from his appearance, he apologized for his intrusion by relating its cause, in a manner so frank and so graceful that his person, which was uncommonly handsome, received additional charms from his voice and expression. END
BEGIN NOW Had he been even old, ugly, and vulgar, the gratitude and kindness of Mrs. Dashwood would have been secured by any act of attention to her child; but the influence of youth, beauty, and elegance, gave an interest to the action which came home to her feelings. END
BEGIN NOW She thanked him again and again; and, with a sweetness of address which always attended her, invited him to be seated. END
BEGIN NOW But this he declined, as he was dirty and wet. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Dashwood then begged to know to whom she was obliged. END
BEGIN NOW His name, he replied, was Willoughby, and his present home was at Allenham, from whence he hoped she would allow him the honour of calling tomorrow to enquire after Miss Dashwood. END
BEGIN NOW The honour was readily granted, and he then departed, to make himself still more interesting, in the midst of a heavy rain. END
BEGIN NOW His manly beauty and more than common gracefulness were instantly the theme of general admiration, and the laugh which his gallantry raised against Marianne received particular spirit from his exterior attractions.&mdash; Marianne herself had seen less of his Mama the rest, for the confusion which crimsoned over her face, on his lifting her up, had robbed her of the power of regarding him after their entering the house. END
BEGIN NOW But she had seen enough of him to join in all the admiration of the others, and with an energy which always adorned her praise. END
BEGIN NOW His person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever drawn for the hero of a favourite story; and in his carrying her into the house with so little previous formality, there was a rapidity of thought which particularly recommended the action to her. END
BEGIN NOW Every circumstance belonging to him was interesting. END
BEGIN NOW His name was good, his residence was in their favourite village, and she soon found out that of all manly dresses a shooting-jacket was the most becoming. END
BEGIN NOW Her imagination was busy, her reflections were pleasant, and the pain of a sprained ankle was disregarded. END
BEGIN NOW Sir John called on them as soon as the next interval of fair weather that morning allowed him to get out of doors; and Marianne's accident being related to him, he was eagerly asked whether he knew any gentleman of the name of Willoughby at Allenham. END
BEGIN NOW Willoughby! END
BEGIN NOW cried Sir John; what, is HE in the country? END
BEGIN NOW That is good news however; I will ride over tomorrow, and ask him to dinner on Thursday. END
BEGIN NOW You know him then, said Mrs. Dashwood. END
BEGIN NOW Know him! END
BEGIN NOW to be sure I do. END
BEGIN NOW Why, he is down here every year. END
BEGIN NOW And what sort of a young man is he? END
BEGIN NOW As good a kind of fellow as ever lived, I assure you. END
BEGIN NOW A very decent shot, and there is not a bolder rider in England. END
BEGIN NOW And is that all you can say for him? END
BEGIN NOW cried Marianne, indignantly. END
BEGIN NOW But what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance? END
BEGIN NOW What his pursuits, his talents, and genius? END
BEGIN NOW Sir John was rather puzzled. END
BEGIN NOW Upon my soul, said he, I do not know much about him as to all THAT. END
BEGIN NOW But he is a pleasant, good humoured fellow, and has got the nicest little black bitch of a pointer I ever saw. END
BEGIN NOW Was she out with him today? END
BEGIN NOW But Marianne could no more satisfy him as to the colour of Mr. Willoughby's pointer, than he could describe to her the shades of his mind. END
BEGIN NOW But who is he? END
BEGIN NOW said Elinor. END
BEGIN NOW Where does he come from? END
BEGIN NOW Has he a house at Allenham? END
BEGIN NOW On this point Sir John could give more certain intelligence; and he told them that Mr. Willoughby had no property of his own in the country; that he resided there only while he was visiting the old lady at Allenham Court, to whom he was related, and whose possessions he was to inherit; adding, Yes, yes, he is very well worth catching I can tell you, Miss Dashwood; he has a pretty little estate of his own in Somersetshire besides; and if I were you, I would not give him up to my younger sister, in spite of all this tumbling down hills. END
BEGIN NOW Miss Marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself. END
BEGIN NOW Brandon will be jealous, if she does not take care. END
BEGIN NOW I do not believe, said Mrs. Dashwood, with a good humoured smile, that Mr. Willoughby will be incommoded by the attempts of either of MY daughters towards what you call CATCHING him. END
BEGIN NOW It is not an employment to which they have been brought up. END
BEGIN NOW Men are very safe with us, let them be ever so rich. END
BEGIN NOW I am glad to find, however, from what you say, that he is a respectable young man, and one whose acquaintance will not be ineligible. END
BEGIN NOW He is as good a sort of fellow, I believe, as ever lived, repeated Sir John. END
BEGIN NOW I remember last Christmas at a little hop at the park, he danced from eight o'clock till four, without once sitting down. END
BEGIN NOW Did he indeed? END
BEGIN NOW cried Marianne with sparkling eyes, and with elegance, with spirit? END
BEGIN NOW Yes; and he was up again at eight to ride to covert. END
BEGIN NOW That is what I like; that is what a young man ought to be. END
BEGIN NOW Whatever be his pursuits, his eagerness in them should know no moderation, and leave him no sense of fatigue. END
BEGIN NOW Aye, aye, I see how it will be, said Sir John, I see how it will be. END
BEGIN NOW You will be setting your cap at him now, and never think of poor Brandon. END
BEGIN NOW That is an expression, Sir John, said Marianne, warmly, which I particularly dislike. END
BEGIN NOW I abhor every common-place phrase by which wit is intended; and 'setting one's cap at a man,' or 'making a conquest,' are the most odious of all. END
BEGIN NOW Their tendency is gross and illiberal; and if their construction could ever be deemed clever, time has long ago destroyed all its ingenuity. END
BEGIN NOW Sir John did not much understand this reproof; but he laughed as heartily as if he did, and then replied, Ay, you will make conquests enough, I dare say, one way or other. END
BEGIN NOW Poor Brandon! END
BEGIN NOW he is quite smitten already, and he is very well worth setting your cap at, I can tell you, in spite of all this tumbling about and spraining of ankles. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne's preserver, as Margaret, with more elegance than precision, styled Willoughby, called at the cottage early the next morning to make his personal enquiries. END
BEGIN NOW He was received by Mrs. Dashwood with more than politeness; with a kindness which Sir John's account of him and her own gratitude prompted; and every thing that passed during the visit tended to assure him of the sense, elegance, mutual affection, and domestic comfort of the family to whom accident had now introduced him. END
BEGIN NOW Of their personal charms he had not required a second interview to be convinced. END
BEGIN NOW Miss Dashwood had a delicate complexion, regular features, and a remarkably pretty figure. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne was still handsomer. END
BEGIN NOW Her form, though not so correct as her sister's, in having the advantage of height, was more striking; and her face was so lovely, that when in the common cant of praise, she was called a beautiful girl, truth was less violently outraged than usually happens. END
BEGIN NOW Her skin was very brown, but, from its transparency, her complexion was uncommonly brilliant; her features were all good; her smile was sweet and attractive; and in her eyes, which were very dark, there was a life, a spirit, an eagerness, which could hardily be seen without delight. END
BEGIN NOW From Willoughby their expression was at first held back, by the embarrassment which the remembrance of his assistance created. END
BEGIN NOW But when this passed away, when her spirits became collected, when she saw that to the perfect good-breeding of the gentleman, he united frankness and vivacity, and above all, when she heard him declare, that of music and dancing he was passionately fond, she gave him such a look of approbation as secured the largest share of his discourse to herself for the rest of his stay. END
BEGIN NOW It was only necessary to mention any favourite amusement to engage her to talk. END
BEGIN NOW She could not be silent when such points were introduced, and she had neither shyness nor reserve in their discussion. END
BEGIN NOW They speedily discovered that their enjoyment of dancing and music was mutual, and that it arose from a general conformity of judgment in all that related to either. END
BEGIN NOW Encouraged by this to a further examination of his opinions, she proceeded to question him on the subject of books; her favourite authors were brought forward and dwelt upon with so rapturous a delight, that any young man of five and twenty must have been insensible indeed, not to become an immediate convert to the excellence of such works, however disregarded before. END
BEGIN NOW Their taste was strikingly alike. END
BEGIN NOW The same books, the same passages were idolized by each&mdash;or if any difference appeared, any objection arose, it lasted no longer than till the force of her arguments and the brightness of her eyes could be displayed. END
BEGIN NOW He acquiesced in all her decisions, caught all her enthusiasm; and long before his visit concluded, they conversed with the familiarity of a long-established acquaintance. END
BEGIN NOW Well, Marianne, said Elinor, as soon as he had left them, for ONE morning I think you have done pretty well. END
BEGIN NOW You have already ascertained Mr. Willoughby's opinion in almost every matter of importance. END
BEGIN NOW You know what he thinks of Cowper and Scott; you are certain of his estimating their beauties as he ought, and you have received every assurance of his admiring Pope no more than is proper. END
BEGIN NOW But how is your acquaintance to be long supported, under such extraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse? END
BEGIN NOW You will soon have exhausted each favourite topic. END
BEGIN NOW Another meeting will suffice to explain his sentiments on picturesque beauty, and second marriages, and then you can have nothing farther to ask. END
BEGIN NOW &mdash; Elinor, cried Marianne, is this fair? END
BEGIN NOW is this just? END
BEGIN NOW are my ideas so scanty? END
BEGIN NOW But I see what you mean. END
BEGIN NOW I have been too much at my ease, too happy, too frank. END
BEGIN NOW I have erred against every common-place notion of decorum; I have been open and sincere where I ought to have been reserved, spiritless, dull, and deceitful&mdash;had I talked only of the weather and the roads, and had I spoken only once in ten minutes, this reproach would have been spared. END
BEGIN NOW My love, said her mother, you must not be offended with Elinor&mdash;she was only in jest. END
BEGIN NOW I should scold her myself, if she were capable of wishing to check the delight of your conversation with our new friend. END
BEGIN NOW &mdash; Marianne was softened in a moment. END
BEGIN NOW Willoughby, on his side, gave every proof of his pleasure in their acquaintance, which an evident wish of improving it could offer. END
BEGIN NOW He came to them every day. END
BEGIN NOW To enquire after Marianne was at first his excuse; but the encouragement of his reception, to which every day gave greater kindness, made such an excuse unnecessary before it had ceased to be possible, by Marianne's perfect recovery. END
BEGIN NOW She was confined for some days to the house; but never had any confinement been less irksome. END
BEGIN NOW Willoughby was a young man of good abilities, quick imagination, lively spirits, and open, affectionate manners. END
BEGIN NOW He was exactly formed to engage Marianne's heart, for with all this, he joined not only a captivating person, but a natural ardour of mind which was now roused and increased by the example of her own, and which recommended him to her affection beyond every thing else. END
BEGIN NOW His society became gradually her most exquisite enjoyment. END
BEGIN NOW They read, they talked, they sang together; his musical talents were considerable; and he read with all the sensibility and spirit which Edward had unfortunately wanted. END
BEGIN NOW In Mrs. Dashwood's estimation he was as faultless as in Marianne's; and Elinor saw nothing to censure in him but a propensity, in which he strongly resembled and peculiarly delighted her sister, of saying too much what he thought on every occasion, without attention to persons or circumstances. END
BEGIN NOW In hastily forming and giving his opinion of other people, in sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment of undivided attention where his heart was engaged, and in slighting too easily the forms of worldly propriety, he displayed a want of caution which Elinor could not approve, in spite of all that he and Marianne could say in its support. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne began now to perceive that the desperation which had seized her at sixteen and a half, of ever seeing a man who could satisfy her ideas of perfection, had been rash and unjustifiable. END
BEGIN NOW Willoughby was all that her fancy had delineated in that unhappy hour and in every brighter period, as capable of attaching her; and his behaviour declared his wishes to be in that respect as earnest, as his abilities were strong. END
BEGIN NOW Her mother too, in whose mind not one speculative thought of their marriage had been raised, by his prospect of riches, was led before the end of a week to hope and expect it; and secretly to congratulate herself on having gained two such sons-in-law as Edward and Willoughby. END
BEGIN NOW Colonel Brandon's partiality for Marianne, which had so early been discovered by his friends, now first became perceptible to Elinor, when it ceased to be noticed by them. END
BEGIN NOW Their attention and wit were drawn off to his more fortunate rival; and the raillery which the other had incurred before any partiality arose, was removed when his feelings began really to call for the ridicule so justly annexed to sensibility. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor was obliged, though unwillingly, to believe that the sentiments which Mrs. Jennings had assigned him for her own satisfaction, were now actually excited by her sister; and that however a general resemblance of disposition between the parties might forward the affection of Mr. Willoughby, an equally striking opposition of character was no hindrance to the regard of Colonel Brandon. END
BEGIN NOW She saw it with concern; for what could a silent man of five and thirty hope, when opposed to a very lively one of five and twenty? END
BEGIN NOW and as she could not even wish him successful, she heartily wished him indifferent. END
BEGIN NOW She liked him&mdash;in spite of his gravity and reserve, she beheld in him an object of interest. END
BEGIN NOW His manners, though serious, were mild; and his reserve appeared rather the result of some oppression of spirits than of any natural gloominess of temper. END
BEGIN NOW Sir John had dropped hints of past injuries and disappointments, which justified her belief of his being an unfortunate man, and she regarded him with respect and compassion. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps she pitied and esteemed him the more because he was slighted by Willoughby and Marianne, who, prejudiced against him for being neither lively nor young, seemed resolved to undervalue his merits. END
BEGIN NOW Brandon is just the kind of man, said Willoughby one day, when they were talking of him together, whom every body speaks well of, and nobody cares about; whom all are delighted to see, and nobody remembers to talk to. END
BEGIN NOW That is exactly what I think of him, cried Marianne. END
BEGIN NOW Do not boast of it, however, said Elinor, for it is injustice in both of you. END
BEGIN NOW He is highly esteemed by all the family at the park, and I never see him myself without taking pains to converse with him. END
BEGIN NOW That he is patronised by YOU, replied Willoughby, is certainly in his favour; but as for the esteem of the others, it is a reproach in itself. END
BEGIN NOW Who would submit to the indignity of being approved by such a woman as Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings, that could command the indifference of any body else? END
BEGIN NOW But perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself and Marianne will make amends for the regard of Lady Middleton and her mother. END
BEGIN NOW If their praise is censure, your censure may be praise, for they are not more undiscerning, than you are prejudiced and unjust. END
BEGIN NOW In defence of your protege you can even be saucy. END
BEGIN NOW My protege, as you call him, is a sensible man; and sense will always have attractions for me. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, Marianne, even in a man between thirty and forty. END
BEGIN NOW He has seen a great deal of the world; has been abroad, has read, and has a thinking mind. END
BEGIN NOW I have found him capable of giving me much information on various subjects; and he has always answered my inquiries with readiness of good-breeding and good nature. END
BEGIN NOW That is to say, cried Marianne contemptuously, he has told you, that in the East Indies the climate is hot, and the mosquitoes are troublesome. END
BEGIN NOW He WOULD have told me so, I doubt not, had I made any such inquiries, but they happened to be points on which I had been previously informed. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps, said Willoughby, his observations may have extended to the existence of nabobs, gold mohrs, and palanquins. END
BEGIN NOW I may venture to say that HIS observations have stretched much further than your candour. END
BEGIN NOW But why should you dislike him? END
BEGIN NOW I do not dislike him. END
BEGIN NOW I consider him, on the contrary, as a very respectable man, who has every body's good word, and nobody's notice; who, has more money than he can spend, more time than he knows how to employ, and two new coats every year. END
BEGIN NOW Add to which, cried Marianne, that he has neither genius, taste, nor spirit. END
BEGIN NOW That his understanding has no brilliancy, his feelings no ardour, and his voice no expression. END
BEGIN NOW You decide on his imperfections so much in the mass, replied Elinor, and so much on the strength of your own imagination, that the commendation I am able to give of him is comparatively cold and insipid. END
BEGIN NOW I can only pronounce him to be a sensible man, well-bred, well-informed, of gentle address, and, I believe, possessing an amiable heart. END
BEGIN NOW Miss Dashwood, cried Willoughby, you are now using me unkindly. END
BEGIN NOW You are endeavouring to disarm me by reason, and to convince me against my will. END
BEGIN NOW But it will not do. END
BEGIN NOW You shall find me as stubborn as you can be artful. END
BEGIN NOW I have three unanswerable reasons for disliking Colonel Brandon; he threatened me with rain when I wanted it to be fine; he has found fault with the hanging of my curricle, and I cannot persuade him to buy my brown mare. END
BEGIN NOW If it will be any satisfaction to you, however, to be told, that I believe his character to be in other respects irreproachable, I am ready to confess it. END
BEGIN NOW And in return for an acknowledgment, which must give me some pain, you cannot deny me the privilege of disliking him as much as ever. END
BEGIN NOW Little had Mrs. Dashwood or her daughters imagined when they first came into Devonshire, that so many engagements would arise to occupy their time as shortly presented themselves, or that they should have such frequent invitations and such constant visitors as to leave them little leisure for serious employment. END
BEGIN NOW Yet such was the case. END
BEGIN NOW When Marianne was recovered, the schemes of amusement at home and abroad, which Sir John had been previously forming, were put into execution. END
BEGIN NOW The private balls at the park then began; and parties on the water were made and accomplished as often as a showery October would allow. END
BEGIN NOW In every meeting of the kind Willoughby was included; and the ease and familiarity which naturally attended these parties were exactly calculated to give increasing intimacy to his acquaintance with the Dashwoods, to afford him opportunity of witnessing the excellencies of Marianne, of marking his animated admiration of her, and of receiving, in her behaviour to himself, the most pointed assurance of her affection. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor could not be surprised at their attachment. END
BEGIN NOW She only wished that it were less openly shewn; and once or twice did venture to suggest the propriety of some self-command to Marianne. END
BEGIN NOW But Marianne abhorred all concealment where no real disgrace could attend unreserve; and to aim at the restraint of sentiments which were not in themselves illaudable, appeared to her not merely an unnecessary effort, but a disgraceful subjection of reason to common-place and mistaken notions. END
BEGIN NOW Willoughby thought the same; and their behaviour at all times, was an illustration of their opinions. END
BEGIN NOW When he was present she had no eyes for any one else. END
BEGIN NOW Every thing he did, was right. END
BEGIN NOW Every thing he said, was clever. END
BEGIN NOW If their evenings at the park were concluded with cards, he cheated himself and all the rest of the party to get her a good hand. END
BEGIN NOW If dancing formed the amusement of the night, they were partners for half the time; and when obliged to separate for a couple of dances, were careful to stand together and scarcely spoke a word to any body else. END
BEGIN NOW Such conduct made them of course most exceedingly laughed at; but ridicule could not shame, and seemed hardly to provoke them. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Dashwood entered into all their feelings with a warmth which left her no inclination for checking this excessive display of them. END
BEGIN NOW To her it was but the natural consequence of a strong affection in a young and ardent mind. END
BEGIN NOW This was the season of happiness to Marianne. END
BEGIN NOW Her heart was devoted to Willoughby, and the fond attachment to Norland, which she brought with her from Sussex, was more likely to be softened than she had thought it possible before, by the charms which his society bestowed on her present home. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor's happiness was not so great. END
BEGIN NOW Her heart was not so much at ease, nor her satisfaction in their amusements so pure. END
BEGIN NOW They afforded her no companion that could make amends for what she had left behind, nor that could teach her to think of Norland with less regret than ever. END
BEGIN NOW Neither Lady Middleton nor Mrs. Jennings could supply to her the conversation she missed; although the latter was an everlasting talker, and from the first had regarded her with a kindness which ensured her a large share of her discourse. END
BEGIN NOW She had already repeated her own history to Elinor three or four times; and had Elinor's memory been equal to her means of improvement, she might have known very early in their acquaintance all the particulars of Mr. Jennings's last illness, and what he said to his wife a few minutes before he died. END
BEGIN NOW Lady Middleton was more agreeable than her mother only in being more silent. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor needed little observation to perceive that her reserve was a mere calmness of manner with which sense had nothing to do. END
BEGIN NOW Towards her husband and mother she was the same as to them; and intimacy was therefore neither to be looked for nor desired. END
BEGIN NOW She had nothing to say one day that she had not said the day before. END
BEGIN NOW Her insipidity was invariable, for even her spirits were always the same; and though she did not oppose the parties arranged by her husband, provided every thing were conducted in style and her two eldest children attended her, she never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them than she might have experienced in sitting at home;&mdash;and so little did her presence add to the pleasure of the others, by any share in their conversation, that they were sometimes only reminded of her being amongst them by her solicitude about her troublesome boys. END
BEGIN NOW In Colonel Brandon alone, of all her new acquaintance, did Elinor find a person who could in any degree claim the respect of abilities, excite the interest of friendship, or give pleasure as a companion. END
BEGIN NOW Willoughby was out of the question. END
BEGIN NOW Her admiration and regard, even her sisterly regard, was all his own; but he was a lover; his attentions were wholly Marianne's, and a far less agreeable man might have been more generally pleasing. END
BEGIN NOW Colonel Brandon, unfortunately for himself, had no such encouragement to think only of Marianne, and in conversing with Elinor he found the greatest consolation for the indifference of her sister. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor's compassion for him increased, as she had reason to suspect that the misery of disappointed love had already been known to him. END
BEGIN NOW This suspicion was given by some words which accidentally dropped from him one evening at the park, when they were sitting down together by mutual consent, while the others were dancing. END
BEGIN NOW His eyes were fixed on Marianne, and, after a silence of some minutes, he said, with a faint smile, Your sister, I understand, does not approve of second attachments. END
BEGIN NOW No, replied Elinor, her opinions are all romantic. END
BEGIN NOW Or rather, as I believe, she considers them impossible to exist. END
BEGIN NOW I believe she does. END
BEGIN NOW But how she contrives it without reflecting on the character of her own father, who had himself two wives, I know not. END
BEGIN NOW A few years however will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis of common sense and observation; and then they may be more easy to define and to justify than they now are, by any body but herself. END
BEGIN NOW This will probably be the case, he replied; and yet there is something so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind, that one is sorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions. END
BEGIN NOW I cannot agree with you there, said Elinor. END
BEGIN NOW There are inconveniences attending such feelings as Marianne's, which all the charms of enthusiasm and ignorance of the world cannot atone for. END
BEGIN NOW Her systems have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought; and a better acquaintance with the world is what I look forward to as her greatest possible advantage. END
BEGIN NOW After a short pause he resumed the conversation by saying,&mdash; Does your sister make no distinction in her objections against a second attachment? END
BEGIN NOW or is it equally criminal in every body? END
BEGIN NOW Are those who have been disappointed in their first choice, whether from the inconstancy of its object, or the perverseness of circumstances, to be equally indifferent during the rest of their lives? END
BEGIN NOW Upon my word, I am not acquainted with the minutiae of her principles. END
BEGIN NOW I only know that I never yet heard her admit any instance of a second attachment's being pardonable. END
BEGIN NOW This, said he, cannot hold; but a change, a total change of sentiments&mdash;No, no, do not desire it; for when the romantic refinements of a young mind are obliged to give way, how frequently are they succeeded by such opinions as are but too common, and too dangerous! END
BEGIN NOW I speak from experience. END
BEGIN NOW I once knew a lady who in temper and mind greatly resembled your sister, who thought and judged like her, but who from an inforced change&mdash;from a series of unfortunate circumstances &mdash; Here he stopt suddenly; appeared to think that he had said too much, and by his countenance gave rise to conjectures, which might not otherwise have entered Elinor's head. END
BEGIN NOW The lady would probably have passed without suspicion, had he not convinced Miss Dashwood that what concerned her ought not to escape his lips. END
BEGIN NOW As it was, it required but a slight effort of fancy to connect his emotion with the tender recollection of past regard. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor attempted no more. END
BEGIN NOW But Marianne, in her place, would not have done so little. END
BEGIN NOW The whole story would have been speedily formed under her active imagination; and every thing established in the most melancholy order of disastrous love. END
BEGIN NOW As Elinor and Marianne were walking together the next morning the latter communicated a piece of news to her sister, which in spite of all that she knew before of Marianne's imprudence and want of thought, surprised her by its extravagant testimony of both. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne told her, with the greatest delight, that Willoughby had given her a horse, one that he had bred himself on his estate in Somersetshire, and which was exactly calculated to carry a woman. END
BEGIN NOW Without considering that it was not in her mother's plan to keep any horse, that if she were to alter her resolution in favour of this gift, she must buy another for the servant, and keep a servant to ride it, and after all, build a stable to receive them, she had accepted the present without hesitation, and told her sister of it in raptures. END
BEGIN NOW He intends to send his groom into Somersetshire immediately for it, she added, and when it arrives we will ride every day. END
BEGIN NOW You shall share its use with me. END
BEGIN NOW Imagine to yourself, my dear Elinor, the delight of a gallop on some of these downs. END
BEGIN NOW Most unwilling was she to awaken from such a dream of felicity to comprehend all the unhappy truths which attended the affair; and for some time she refused to submit to them. END
BEGIN NOW As to an additional servant, the expense would be a trifle; Mama she was sure would never object to it; and any horse would do for HIM; he might always get one at the park; as to a stable, the merest shed would be sufficient. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor then ventured to doubt the propriety of her receiving such a present from a man so little, or at least so lately known to her. END
BEGIN NOW This was too much. END
BEGIN NOW You are mistaken, Elinor, said she warmly, in supposing I know very little of Willoughby. END
BEGIN NOW I have not known him long indeed, but I am much better acquainted with him, than I am with any other creature in the world, except yourself and mama. END
BEGIN NOW It is not time or opportunity that is to determine intimacy;&mdash;it is disposition alone. END
BEGIN NOW Seven years would be insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other, and seven days are more than enough for others. END
BEGIN NOW I should hold myself guilty of greater impropriety in accepting a horse from my brother, than from Willoughby. END
BEGIN NOW Of John I know very little, though we have lived together for years; but of Willoughby my judgment has long been formed. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor thought it wisest to touch that point no more. END
BEGIN NOW She knew her sister's temper. END
BEGIN NOW Opposition on so tender a subject would only attach her the more to her own opinion. END
BEGIN NOW But by an appeal to her affection for her mother, by representing the inconveniences which that indulgent mother must draw on herself, if (as would probably be the case) she consented to this increase of establishment, Marianne was shortly subdued; and she promised not to tempt her mother to such imprudent kindness by mentioning the offer, and to tell Willoughby when she saw him next, that it must be declined. END
BEGIN NOW She was faithful to her word; and when Willoughby called at the cottage, the same day, Elinor heard her express her disappointment to him in a low voice, on being obliged to forego the acceptance of his present. END
BEGIN NOW The reasons for this alteration were at the same time related, and they were such as to make further entreaty on his side impossible. END
BEGIN NOW His concern however was very apparent; and after expressing it with earnestness, he added, in the same low voice,&mdash; But, Marianne, the horse is still yours, though you cannot use it now. END
BEGIN NOW I shall keep it only till you can claim it. END
BEGIN NOW When you leave Barton to form your own establishment in a more lasting home, Queen Mab shall receive you. END
BEGIN NOW This was all overheard by Miss Dashwood; and in the whole of the sentence, in his manner of pronouncing it, and in his addressing her sister by her Christian name alone, she instantly saw an intimacy so decided, a meaning so direct, as marked a perfect agreement between them. END
BEGIN NOW From that moment she doubted not of their being engaged to each other; and the belief of it created no other surprise than that she, or any of their friends, should be left by tempers so frank, to discover it by accident. END
BEGIN NOW Margaret related something to her the next day, which placed this matter in a still clearer light. END
BEGIN NOW Willoughby had spent the preceding evening with them, and Margaret, by being left some time in the parlour with only him and Marianne, had had opportunity for observations, which, with a most important face, she communicated to her eldest sister, when they were next by themselves. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, Elinor! END
BEGIN NOW she cried, I have such a secret to tell you about Marianne. END
BEGIN NOW I am sure she will be married to Mr. Willoughby very soon. END
BEGIN NOW You have said so, replied Elinor, almost every day since they first met on High-church Down; and they had not known each other a week, I believe, before you were certain that Marianne wore his picture round her neck; but it turned out to be only the miniature of our great uncle. END
BEGIN NOW But indeed this is quite another thing. END
BEGIN NOW I am sure they will be married very soon, for he has got a lock of her hair. END
BEGIN NOW Take care, Margaret. END
BEGIN NOW It may be only the hair of some great uncle of HIS. END
BEGIN NOW But, indeed, Elinor, it is Marianne's. END
BEGIN NOW I am almost sure it is, for I saw him cut it off. END
BEGIN NOW Last night after tea, when you and mama went out of the room, they were whispering and talking together as fast as could be, and he seemed to be begging something of her, and presently he took up her scissors and cut off a long lock of her hair, for it was all tumbled down her back; and he kissed it, and folded it up in a piece of white paper; and put it into his pocket-book. END
BEGIN NOW For such particulars, stated on such authority, Elinor could not withhold her credit; nor was she disposed to it, for the circumstance was in perfect unison with what she had heard and seen herself. END
BEGIN NOW Margaret's sagacity was not always displayed in a way so satisfactory to her sister. END
BEGIN NOW When Mrs. Jennings attacked her one evening at the park, to give the name of the young man who was Elinor's particular favourite, which had been long a matter of great curiosity to her, Margaret answered by looking at her sister, and saying, I must not tell, may I, Elinor? END
BEGIN NOW This of course made every body laugh; and Elinor tried to laugh too. END
BEGIN NOW But the effort was painful. END
BEGIN NOW She was convinced that Margaret had fixed on a person whose name she could not bear with composure to become a standing joke with Mrs. Jennings. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne felt for her most sincerely; but she did more harm than good to the cause, by turning very red and saying in an angry manner to Margaret, Remember that whatever your conjectures may be, you have no right to repeat them. END
BEGIN NOW I never had any conjectures about it, replied Margaret; it was you who told me of it yourself. END
BEGIN NOW This increased the mirth of the company, and Margaret was eagerly pressed to say something more. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW pray, Miss Margaret, let us know all about it, said Mrs. Jennings. END
BEGIN NOW What is the gentleman's name? END
BEGIN NOW I must not tell, ma'am. END
BEGIN NOW But I know very well what it is; and I know where he is too. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, yes, we can guess where he is; at his own house at Norland to be sure. END
BEGIN NOW He is the curate of the parish I dare say. END
BEGIN NOW No, THAT he is not. END
BEGIN NOW He is of no profession at all. END
BEGIN NOW Margaret, said Marianne with great warmth, you know that all this is an invention of your own, and that there is no such person in existence. END
BEGIN NOW Well, then, he is lately dead, Marianne, for I am sure there was such a man once, and his name begins with an F. Most grateful did Elinor feel to Lady Middleton for observing, at this moment, that it rained very hard, though she believed the interruption to proceed less from any attention to her, than from her ladyship's great dislike of all such inelegant subjects of raillery as delighted her husband and mother. END
BEGIN NOW The idea however started by her, was immediately pursued by Colonel Brandon, who was on every occasion mindful of the feelings of others; and much was said on the subject of rain by both of them. END
BEGIN NOW Willoughby opened the piano-forte, and asked Marianne to sit down to it; and thus amidst the various endeavours of different people to quit the topic, it fell to the ground. END
BEGIN NOW But not so easily did Elinor recover from the alarm into which it had thrown her. END
BEGIN NOW A party was formed this evening for going on the following day to see a very fine place about twelve miles from Barton, belonging to a brother-in-law of Colonel Brandon, without whose interest it could not be seen, as the proprietor, who was then abroad, had left strict orders on that head. END
BEGIN NOW The grounds were declared to be highly beautiful, and Sir John, who was particularly warm in their praise, might be allowed to be a tolerable judge, for he had formed parties to visit them, at least, twice every summer for the last ten years. END
BEGIN NOW They contained a noble piece of water; a sail on which was to a form a great part of the morning's amusement; cold provisions were to be taken, open carriages only to be employed, and every thing conducted in the usual style of a complete party of pleasure. END
BEGIN NOW To some few of the company it appeared rather a bold undertaking, considering the time of year, and that it had rained every day for the last fortnight;&mdash;and Mrs. Dashwood, who had already a cold, was persuaded by Elinor to stay at home. END
BEGIN NOW Their intended excursion to Whitwell turned out very different from what Elinor had expected. END
BEGIN NOW She was prepared to be wet through, fatigued, and frightened; but the event was still more unfortunate, for they did not go at all. END
BEGIN NOW By ten o'clock the whole party was assembled at the park, where they were to breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW The morning was rather favourable, though it had rained all night, as the clouds were then dispersing across the sky, and the sun frequently appeared. END
BEGIN NOW They were all in high spirits and good humour, eager to be happy, and determined to submit to the greatest inconveniences and hardships rather than be otherwise. END
BEGIN NOW While they were at breakfast the letters were brought in. END
BEGIN NOW Among the rest there was one for Colonel Brandon;&mdash;he took it, looked at the direction, changed colour, and immediately left the room. END
BEGIN NOW What is the matter with Brandon? END
BEGIN NOW said Sir John. END
BEGIN NOW Nobody could tell. END
BEGIN NOW I hope he has had no bad news, said Lady Middleton. END
BEGIN NOW It must be something extraordinary that could make Colonel Brandon leave my breakfast table so suddenly. END
BEGIN NOW In about five minutes he returned. END
BEGIN NOW No bad news, Colonel, I hope; said Mrs. Jennings, as soon as he entered the room. END
BEGIN NOW None at all, ma'am, I thank you. END
BEGIN NOW Was it from Avignon? END
BEGIN NOW I hope it is not to say that your sister is worse. END
BEGIN NOW No, ma'am. END
BEGIN NOW It came from town, and is merely a letter of business. END
BEGIN NOW But how came the hand to discompose you so much, if it was only a letter of business? END
BEGIN NOW Come, come, this won't do, Colonel; so let us hear the truth of it. END
BEGIN NOW My dear madam, said Lady Middleton, recollect what you are saying. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps it is to tell you that your cousin Fanny is married? END
BEGIN NOW said Mrs. Jennings, without attending to her daughter's reproof. END
BEGIN NOW No, indeed, it is not. END
BEGIN NOW Well, then, I know who it is from, Colonel. END
BEGIN NOW And I hope she is well. END
BEGIN NOW Whom do you mean, ma'am? END
BEGIN NOW said he, colouring a little. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW you know who I mean. END
BEGIN NOW I am particularly sorry, ma'am, said he, addressing Lady Middleton, that I should receive this letter today, for it is on business which requires my immediate attendance in town. END
BEGIN NOW In town! END
BEGIN NOW cried Mrs. Jennings. END
BEGIN NOW What can you have to do in town at this time of year? END
BEGIN NOW My own loss is great, he continued, in being obliged to leave so agreeable a party; but I am the more concerned, as I fear my presence is necessary to gain your admittance at Whitwell. END
BEGIN NOW What a blow upon them all was this! END
BEGIN NOW But if you write a note to the housekeeper, Mr. Brandon, said Marianne, eagerly, will it not be sufficient? END
BEGIN NOW He shook his head. END
BEGIN NOW We must go, said Sir John.&mdash; It shall not be put off when we are so near it. END
BEGIN NOW You cannot go to town till tomorrow, Brandon, that is all. END
BEGIN NOW I wish it could be so easily settled. END
BEGIN NOW But it is not in my power to delay my journey for one day! END
BEGIN NOW If you would but let us know what your business is, said Mrs. Jennings, we might see whether it could be put off or not. END
BEGIN NOW You would not be six hours later, said Willoughby, if you were to defer your journey till our return. END
BEGIN NOW I cannot afford to lose ONE hour. END
BEGIN NOW &mdash; Elinor then heard Willoughby say, in a low voice to Marianne, There are some people who cannot bear a party of pleasure. END
BEGIN NOW Brandon is one of them. END
BEGIN NOW He was afraid of catching cold I dare say, and invented this trick for getting out of it. END
BEGIN NOW I would lay fifty guineas the letter was of his own writing. END
BEGIN NOW I have no doubt of it, replied Marianne. END
BEGIN NOW There is no persuading you to change your mind, Brandon, I know of old, said Sir John, when once you are determined on anything. END
BEGIN NOW But, however, I hope you will think better of it. END
BEGIN NOW Consider, here are the two Miss Careys come over from Newton, the three Miss Dashwoods walked up from the cottage, and Mr. Willoughby got up two hours before his usual time, on purpose to go to Whitwell. END
BEGIN NOW Colonel Brandon again repeated his sorrow at being the cause of disappointing the party; but at the same time declared it to be unavoidable. END
BEGIN NOW Well, then, when will you come back again? END
BEGIN NOW I hope we shall see you at Barton, added her ladyship, as soon as you can conveniently leave town; and we must put off the party to Whitwell till you return. END
BEGIN NOW You are very obliging. END
BEGIN NOW But it is so uncertain, when I may have it in my power to return, that I dare not engage for it at all. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW he must and shall come back, cried Sir John. END
BEGIN NOW If he is not here by the end of the week, I shall go after him. END
BEGIN NOW Ay, so do, Sir John, cried Mrs. Jennings, and then perhaps you may find out what his business is. END
BEGIN NOW I do not want to pry into other men's concerns. END
BEGIN NOW I suppose it is something he is ashamed of. END
BEGIN NOW Colonel Brandon's horses were announced. END
BEGIN NOW You do not go to town on horseback, do you? END
BEGIN NOW added Sir John. END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW Only to Honiton. END
BEGIN NOW I shall then go post. END
BEGIN NOW Well, as you are resolved to go, I wish you a good journey. END
BEGIN NOW But you had better change your mind. END
BEGIN NOW I assure you it is not in my power. END
BEGIN NOW He then took leave of the whole party. END
BEGIN NOW Is there no chance of my seeing you and your sisters in town this winter, Miss Dashwood? END
BEGIN NOW I am afraid, none at all. END
BEGIN NOW Then I must bid you farewell for a longer time than I should wish to do. END
BEGIN NOW To Marianne, he merely bowed and said nothing. END
BEGIN NOW Come Colonel, said Mrs. Jennings, before you go, do let us know what you are going about. END
BEGIN NOW He wished her a good morning, and, attended by Sir John, left the room. END
BEGIN NOW The complaints and lamentations which politeness had hitherto restrained, now burst forth universally; and they all agreed again and again how provoking it was to be so disappointed. END
BEGIN NOW I can guess what his business is, however, said Mrs. Jennings exultingly. END
BEGIN NOW Can you, ma'am? END
BEGIN NOW said almost every body. END
BEGIN NOW Yes; it is about Miss Williams, I am sure. END
BEGIN NOW And who is Miss Williams? END
BEGIN NOW asked Marianne. END
BEGIN NOW What! END
BEGIN NOW do not you know who Miss Williams is? END
BEGIN NOW I am sure you must have heard of her before. END
BEGIN NOW She is a relation of the Colonel's, my dear; a very near relation. END
BEGIN NOW We will not say how near, for fear of shocking the young ladies. END
BEGIN NOW Then, lowering her voice a little, she said to Elinor, She is his natural daughter. END
BEGIN NOW Indeed! END
BEGIN NOW Oh, yes; and as like him as she can stare. END
BEGIN NOW I dare say the Colonel will leave her all his fortune. END
BEGIN NOW When Sir John returned, he joined most heartily in the general regret on so unfortunate an event; concluding however by observing, that as they were all got together, they must do something by way of being happy; and after some consultation it was agreed, that although happiness could only be enjoyed at Whitwell, they might procure a tolerable composure of mind by driving about the country. END
BEGIN NOW The carriages were then ordered; Willoughby's was first, and Marianne never looked happier than when she got into it. END
BEGIN NOW He drove through the park very fast, and they were soon out of sight; and nothing more of them was seen till their return, which did not happen till after the return of all the rest. END
BEGIN NOW They both seemed delighted with their drive; but said only in general terms that they had kept in the lanes, while the others went on the downs. END
BEGIN NOW It was settled that there should be a dance in the evening, and that every body should be extremely merry all day long. END
BEGIN NOW Some more of the Careys came to dinner, and they had the pleasure of sitting down nearly twenty to table, which Sir John observed with great contentment. END
BEGIN NOW Willoughby took his usual place between the two elder Miss Dashwoods. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Jennings sat on Elinor's right hand; and they had not been long seated, before she leant behind her and Willoughby, and said to Marianne, loud enough for them both to hear, I have found you out in spite of all your tricks. END
BEGIN NOW I know where you spent the morning. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne coloured, and replied very hastily, Where, pray? END
BEGIN NOW &mdash; Did not you know, said Willoughby, that we had been out in my curricle? END
BEGIN NOW Yes, yes, Mr. Impudence, I know that very well, and I was determined to find out WHERE you had been to.&mdash; I hope you like your house, Miss Marianne. END
BEGIN NOW It is a very large one, I know; and when I come to see you, I hope you will have new-furnished it, for it wanted it very much when I was there six years ago. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne turned away in great confusion. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Jennings laughed heartily; and Elinor found that in her resolution to know where they had been, she had actually made her own woman enquire of Mr. Willoughby's groom; and that she had by that method been informed that they had gone to Allenham, and spent a considerable time there in walking about the garden and going all over the house. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor could hardly believe this to be true, as it seemed very unlikely that Willoughby should propose, or Marianne consent, to enter the house while Mrs. Smith was in it, with whom Marianne had not the smallest acquaintance. END
BEGIN NOW As soon as they left the dining-room, Elinor enquired of her about it; and great was her surprise when she found that every circumstance related by Mrs. Jennings was perfectly true. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne was quite angry with her for doubting it. END
BEGIN NOW Why should you imagine, Elinor, that we did not go there, or that we did not see the house? END
BEGIN NOW Is not it what you have often wished to do yourself? END
BEGIN NOW Yes, Marianne, but I would not go while Mrs. Smith was there, and with no other companion than Mr. Willoughby. END
BEGIN NOW Mr. Willoughby however is the only person who can have a right to shew that house; and as he went in an open carriage, it was impossible to have any other companion. END
BEGIN NOW I never spent a pleasanter morning in my life. END
BEGIN NOW I am afraid, replied Elinor, that the pleasantness of an employment does not always evince its propriety. END
BEGIN NOW On the contrary, nothing can be a stronger proof of it, Elinor; for if there had been any real impropriety in what I did, I should have been sensible of it at the time, for we always know when we are acting wrong, and with such a conviction I could have had no pleasure. END
BEGIN NOW But, my dear Marianne, as it has already exposed you to some very impertinent remarks, do you not now begin to doubt the discretion of your own conduct? END
BEGIN NOW If the impertinent remarks of Mrs. Jennings are to be the proof of impropriety in conduct, we are all offending every moment of our lives. END
BEGIN NOW I value not her censure any more than I should do her commendation. END
BEGIN NOW I am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking over Mrs. Smith's grounds, or in seeing her house. END
BEGIN NOW They will one day be Mr. Willoughby's, and&mdash; If they were one day to be your own, Marianne, you would not be justified in what you have done. END
BEGIN NOW She blushed at this hint; but it was even visibly gratifying to her; and after a ten minutes' interval of earnest thought, she came to her sister again, and said with great good humour, Perhaps, Elinor, it WAS rather ill-judged in me to go to Allenham; but Mr. Willoughby wanted particularly to shew me the place; and it is a charming house, I assure you.&mdash;There is one remarkably pretty sitting room up stairs; of a nice comfortable size for constant use, and with modern furniture it would be delightful. END
BEGIN NOW It is a corner room, and has windows on two sides. END
BEGIN NOW On one side you look across the bowling-green, behind the house, to a beautiful hanging wood, and on the other you have a view of the church and village, and, beyond them, of those fine bold hills that we have so often admired. END
BEGIN NOW I did not see it to advantage, for nothing could be more forlorn than the furniture,&mdash;but if it were newly fitted up&mdash;a couple of hundred pounds, Willoughby says, would make it one of the pleasantest summer-rooms in England. END
BEGIN NOW Could Elinor have listened to her without interruption from the others, she would have described every room in the house with equal delight. END
BEGIN NOW The sudden termination of Colonel Brandon's visit at the park, with his steadiness in concealing its cause, filled the mind, and raised the wonder of Mrs. Jennings for two or three days; she was a great wonderer, as every one must be who takes a very lively interest in all the comings and goings of all their acquaintance. END
BEGIN NOW She wondered, with little intermission what could be the reason of it; was sure there must be some bad news, and thought over every kind of distress that could have befallen him, with a fixed determination that he should not escape them all. END
BEGIN NOW Something very melancholy must be the matter, I am sure, said she. END
BEGIN NOW I could see it in his face. END
BEGIN NOW Poor man! END
BEGIN NOW I am afraid his circumstances may be bad. END
BEGIN NOW The estate at Delaford was never reckoned more than two thousand a year, and his brother left everything sadly involved. END
BEGIN NOW I do think he must have been sent for about money matters, for what else can it be? END
BEGIN NOW I wonder whether it is so. END
BEGIN NOW I would give anything to know the truth of it. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps it is about Miss Williams and, by the bye, I dare say it is, because he looked so conscious when I mentioned her. END
BEGIN NOW May be she is ill in town; nothing in the world more likely, for I have a notion she is always rather sickly. END
BEGIN NOW I would lay any wager it is about Miss Williams. END
BEGIN NOW It is not so very likely he should be distressed in his circumstances NOW, for he is a very prudent man, and to be sure must have cleared the estate by this time. END
BEGIN NOW I wonder what it can be! END
BEGIN NOW May be his sister is worse at Avignon, and has sent for him over. END
BEGIN NOW His setting off in such a hurry seems very like it. END
BEGIN NOW Well, I wish him out of all his trouble with all my heart, and a good wife into the bargain. END
BEGIN NOW So wondered, so talked Mrs. Jennings. END
BEGIN NOW Her opinion varying with every fresh conjecture, and all seeming equally probable as they arose. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor, though she felt really interested in the welfare of Colonel Brandon, could not bestow all the wonder on his going so suddenly away, which Mrs. Jennings was desirous of her feeling; for besides that the circumstance did not in her opinion justify such lasting amazement or variety of speculation, her wonder was otherwise disposed of. END
BEGIN NOW It was engrossed by the extraordinary silence of her sister and Willoughby on the subject, which they must know to be peculiarly interesting to them all. END
BEGIN NOW As this silence continued, every day made it appear more strange and more incompatible with the disposition of both. END
BEGIN NOW Why they should not openly acknowledge to her mother and herself, what their constant behaviour to each other declared to have taken place, Elinor could not imagine. END
BEGIN NOW She could easily conceive that marriage might not be immediately in their power; for though Willoughby was independent, there was no reason to believe him rich. END
BEGIN NOW His estate had been rated by Sir John at about six or seven hundred a year; but he lived at an expense to which that income could hardly be equal, and he had himself often complained of his poverty. END
BEGIN NOW But for this strange kind of secrecy maintained by them relative to their engagement, which in fact concealed nothing at all, she could not account; and it was so wholly contradictory to their general opinions and practice, that a doubt sometimes entered her mind of their being really engaged, and this doubt was enough to prevent her making any inquiry of Marianne. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing could be more expressive of attachment to them all, than Willoughby's behaviour. END
BEGIN NOW To Marianne it had all the distinguishing tenderness which a lover's heart could give, and to the rest of the family it was the affectionate attention of a son and a brother. END
BEGIN NOW The cottage seemed to be considered and loved by him as his home; many more of his hours were spent there than at Allenham; and if no general engagement collected them at the park, the exercise which called him out in the morning was almost certain of ending there, where the rest of the day was spent by himself at the side of Marianne, and by his favourite pointer at her feet. END
BEGIN NOW One evening in particular, about a week after Colonel Brandon left the country, his heart seemed more than usually open to every feeling of attachment to the objects around him; and on Mrs. Dashwood's happening to mention her design of improving the cottage in the spring, he warmly opposed every alteration of a place which affection had established as perfect with him. END
BEGIN NOW What! END
BEGIN NOW he exclaimed&mdash; Improve this dear cottage! END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW THAT I will never consent to. END
BEGIN NOW Not a stone must be added to its walls, not an inch to its size, if my feelings are regarded. END
BEGIN NOW Do not be alarmed, said Miss Dashwood, nothing of the kind will be done; for my mother will never have money enough to attempt it. END
BEGIN NOW I am heartily glad of it, he cried. END
BEGIN NOW May she always be poor, if she can employ her riches no better. END
BEGIN NOW Thank you, Willoughby. END
BEGIN NOW But you may be assured that I would not sacrifice one sentiment of local attachment of yours, or of any one whom I loved, for all the improvements in the world. END
BEGIN NOW Depend upon it that whatever unemployed sum may remain, when I make up my accounts in the spring, I would even rather lay it uselessly by than dispose of it in a manner so painful to you. END
BEGIN NOW But are you really so attached to this place as to see no defect in it? END
BEGIN NOW I am, said he. END
BEGIN NOW To me it is faultless. END
BEGIN NOW Nay, more, I consider it as the only form of building in which happiness is attainable, and were I rich enough I would instantly pull Combe down, and build it up again in the exact plan of this cottage. END
BEGIN NOW With dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that smokes, I suppose, said Elinor. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, cried he in the same eager tone, with all and every thing belonging to it;&mdash;in no one convenience or INconvenience about it, should the least variation be perceptible. END
BEGIN NOW Then, and then only, under such a roof, I might perhaps be as happy at Combe as I have been at Barton. END
BEGIN NOW I flatter myself, replied Elinor, that even under the disadvantage of better rooms and a broader staircase, you will hereafter find your own house as faultless as you now do this. END
BEGIN NOW There certainly are circumstances, said Willoughby, which might greatly endear it to me; but this place will always have one claim of my affection, which no other can possibly share. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Dashwood looked with pleasure at Marianne, whose fine eyes were fixed so expressively on Willoughby, as plainly denoted how well she understood him. END
BEGIN NOW How often did I wish, added he, when I was at Allenham this time twelvemonth, that Barton cottage were inhabited! END
BEGIN NOW I never passed within view of it without admiring its situation, and grieving that no one should live in it. END
BEGIN NOW How little did I then think that the very first news I should hear from Mrs. Smith, when I next came into the country, would be that Barton cottage was taken: and I felt an immediate satisfaction and interest in the event, which nothing but a kind of prescience of what happiness I should experience from it, can account for. END
BEGIN NOW Must it not have been so, Marianne? END
BEGIN NOW speaking to her in a lowered voice. END
BEGIN NOW Then continuing his former tone, he said, And yet this house you would spoil, Mrs. Dashwood? END
BEGIN NOW You would rob it of its simplicity by imaginary improvement! END
BEGIN NOW and this dear parlour in which our acquaintance first began, and in which so many happy hours have been since spent by us together, you would degrade to the condition of a common entrance, and every body would be eager to pass through the room which has hitherto contained within itself more real accommodation and comfort than any other apartment of the handsomest dimensions in the world could possibly afford. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Dashwood again assured him that no alteration of the kind should be attempted. END
BEGIN NOW You are a good woman, he warmly replied. END
BEGIN NOW Your promise makes me easy. END
BEGIN NOW Extend it a little farther, and it will make me happy. END
BEGIN NOW Tell me that not only your house will remain the same, but that I shall ever find you and yours as unchanged as your dwelling; and that you will always consider me with the kindness which has made everything belonging to you so dear to me. END
BEGIN NOW The promise was readily given, and Willoughby's behaviour during the whole of the evening declared at once his affection and happiness. END
BEGIN NOW Shall we see you tomorrow to dinner? END
BEGIN NOW said Mrs. Dashwood, when he was leaving them. END
BEGIN NOW I do not ask you to come in the morning, for we must walk to the park, to call on Lady Middleton. END
BEGIN NOW He engaged to be with them by four o'clock. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Dashwood's visit to Lady Middleton took place the next day, and two of her daughters went with her; but Marianne excused herself from being of the party, under some trifling pretext of employment; and her mother, who concluded that a promise had been made by Willoughby the night before of calling on her while they were absent, was perfectly satisfied with her remaining at home. END
BEGIN NOW On their return from the park they found Willoughby's curricle and servant in waiting at the cottage, and Mrs. Dashwood was convinced that her conjecture had been just. END
BEGIN NOW So far it was all as she had foreseen; but on entering the house she beheld what no foresight had taught her to expect. END
BEGIN NOW They were no sooner in the passage than Marianne came hastily out of the parlour apparently in violent affliction, with her handkerchief at her eyes; and without noticing them ran up stairs. END
BEGIN NOW Surprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room she had just quitted, where they found only Willoughby, who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his back towards them. END
BEGIN NOW He turned round on their coming in, and his countenance shewed that he strongly partook of the emotion which over-powered Marianne. END
BEGIN NOW Is anything the matter with her? END
BEGIN NOW cried Mrs. Dashwood as she entered&mdash; is she ill? END
BEGIN NOW I hope not, he replied, trying to look cheerful; and with a forced smile presently added, It is I who may rather expect to be ill&mdash;for I am now suffering under a very heavy disappointment! END
BEGIN NOW Disappointment? END
BEGIN NOW Yes, for I am unable to keep my engagement with you. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Smith has this morning exercised the privilege of riches upon a poor dependent cousin, by sending me on business to London. END
BEGIN NOW I have just received my dispatches, and taken my farewell of Allenham; and by way of exhilaration I am now come to take my farewell of you. END
BEGIN NOW To London!&mdash;and are you going this morning? END
BEGIN NOW Almost this moment. END
BEGIN NOW This is very unfortunate. END
BEGIN NOW But Mrs. Smith must be obliged;&mdash;and her business will not detain you from us long I hope. END
BEGIN NOW He coloured as he replied, You are very kind, but I have no idea of returning into Devonshire immediately. END
BEGIN NOW My visits to Mrs. Smith are never repeated within the twelvemonth. END
BEGIN NOW And is Mrs. Smith your only friend? END
BEGIN NOW Is Allenham the only house in the neighbourhood to which you will be welcome? END
BEGIN NOW For shame, Willoughby, can you wait for an invitation here? END
BEGIN NOW His colour increased; and with his eyes fixed on the ground he only replied, You are too good. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Dashwood looked at Elinor with surprise. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor felt equal amazement. END
BEGIN NOW For a few moments every one was silent. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Dashwood first spoke. END
BEGIN NOW I have only to add, my dear Willoughby, that at Barton cottage you will always be welcome; for I will not press you to return here immediately, because you only can judge how far THAT might be pleasing to Mrs. Smith; and on this head I shall be no more disposed to question your judgment than to doubt your inclination. END
BEGIN NOW My engagements at present, replied Willoughby, confusedly, are of such a nature&mdash;that&mdash;I dare not flatter myself &mdash; He stopt. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Dashwood was too much astonished to speak, and another pause succeeded. END
BEGIN NOW This was broken by Willoughby, who said with a faint smile, It is folly to linger in this manner. END
BEGIN NOW I will not torment myself any longer by remaining among friends whose society it is impossible for me now to enjoy. END
BEGIN NOW He then hastily took leave of them all and left the room. END
BEGIN NOW They saw him step into his carriage, and in a minute it was out of sight. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Dashwood felt too much for speech, and instantly quitted the parlour to give way in solitude to the concern and alarm which this sudden departure occasioned. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor's uneasiness was at least equal to her mother's. END
BEGIN NOW She thought of what had just passed with anxiety and distrust. END
BEGIN NOW Willoughby's behaviour in taking leave of them, his embarrassment, and affectation of cheerfulness, and, above all, his unwillingness to accept her mother's invitation, a backwardness so unlike a lover, so unlike himself, greatly disturbed her. END
BEGIN NOW One moment she feared that no serious design had ever been formed on his side; and the next that some unfortunate quarrel had taken place between him and her sister;&mdash;the distress in which Marianne had quitted the room was such as a serious quarrel could most reasonably account for, though when she considered what Marianne's love for him was, a quarrel seemed almost impossible. END
BEGIN NOW But whatever might be the particulars of their separation, her sister's affliction was indubitable; and she thought with the tenderest compassion of that violent sorrow which Marianne was in all probability not merely giving way to as a relief, but feeding and encouraging as a duty. END
BEGIN NOW In about half an hour her mother returned, and though her eyes were red, her countenance was not uncheerful. END
BEGIN NOW Our dear Willoughby is now some miles from Barton, Elinor, said she, as she sat down to work, and with how heavy a heart does he travel? END
BEGIN NOW It is all very strange. END
BEGIN NOW So suddenly to be gone! END
BEGIN NOW It seems but the work of a moment. END
BEGIN NOW And last night he was with us so happy, so cheerful, so affectionate? END
BEGIN NOW And now, after only ten minutes notice&mdash;Gone too without intending to return!&mdash;Something more than what he owned to us must have happened. END
BEGIN NOW He did not speak, he did not behave like himself. END
BEGIN NOW YOU must have seen the difference as well as I. END
BEGIN NOW What can it be? END
BEGIN NOW Can they have quarrelled? END
BEGIN NOW Why else should he have shewn such unwillingness to accept your invitation here? END
BEGIN NOW &mdash; It was not inclination that he wanted, Elinor; I could plainly see THAT. END
BEGIN NOW He had not the power of accepting it. END
BEGIN NOW I have thought it all over I assure you, and I can perfectly account for every thing that at first seemed strange to me as well as to you. END
BEGIN NOW Can you, indeed! END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW I have explained it to myself in the most satisfactory way;&mdash;but you, Elinor, who love to doubt where you can&mdash;it will not satisfy YOU, I know; but you shall not talk ME out of my trust in it. END
BEGIN NOW I am persuaded that Mrs. Smith suspects his regard for Marianne, disapproves of it, (perhaps because she has other views for him,) and on that account is eager to get him away;&mdash;and that the business which she sends him off to transact is invented as an excuse to dismiss him. END
BEGIN NOW This is what I believe to have happened. END
BEGIN NOW He is, moreover, aware that she DOES disapprove the connection, he dares not therefore at present confess to her his engagement with Marianne, and he feels himself obliged, from his dependent situation, to give into her schemes, and absent himself from Devonshire for a while. END
BEGIN NOW You will tell me, I know, that this may or may NOT have happened; but I will listen to no cavil, unless you can point out any other method of understanding the affair as satisfactory at this. END
BEGIN NOW And now, Elinor, what have you to say? END
BEGIN NOW Nothing, for you have anticipated my answer. END
BEGIN NOW Then you would have told me, that it might or might not have happened. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, Elinor, how incomprehensible are your feelings! END
BEGIN NOW You had rather take evil upon credit than good. END
BEGIN NOW You had rather look out for misery for Marianne, and guilt for poor Willoughby, than an apology for the latter. END
BEGIN NOW You are resolved to think him blameable, because he took leave of us with less affection than his usual behaviour has shewn. END
BEGIN NOW And is no allowance to be made for inadvertence, or for spirits depressed by recent disappointment? END
BEGIN NOW Are no probabilities to be accepted, merely because they are not certainties? END
BEGIN NOW Is nothing due to the man whom we have all such reason to love, and no reason in the world to think ill of? END
BEGIN NOW To the possibility of motives unanswerable in themselves, though unavoidably secret for a while? END
BEGIN NOW And, after all, what is it you suspect him of? END
BEGIN NOW I can hardly tell myself. END
BEGIN NOW But suspicion of something unpleasant is the inevitable consequence of such an alteration as we just witnessed in him. END
BEGIN NOW There is great truth, however, in what you have now urged of the allowances which ought to be made for him, and it is my wish to be candid in my judgment of every body. END
BEGIN NOW Willoughby may undoubtedly have very sufficient reasons for his conduct, and I will hope that he has. END
BEGIN NOW But it would have been more like Willoughby to acknowledge them at once. END
BEGIN NOW Secrecy may be advisable; but still I cannot help wondering at its being practiced by him. END
BEGIN NOW Do not blame him, however, for departing from his character, where the deviation is necessary. END
BEGIN NOW But you really do admit the justice of what I have said in his defence?&mdash;I am happy&mdash;and he is acquitted. END
BEGIN NOW Not entirely. END
BEGIN NOW It may be proper to conceal their engagement (if they ARE engaged) from Mrs. Smith&mdash;and if that is the case, it must be highly expedient for Willoughby to be but little in Devonshire at present. END
BEGIN NOW But this is no excuse for their concealing it from us. END
BEGIN NOW Concealing it from us! END
BEGIN NOW my dear child, do you accuse Willoughby and Marianne of concealment? END
BEGIN NOW This is strange indeed, when your eyes have been reproaching them every day for incautiousness. END
BEGIN NOW I want no proof of their affection, said Elinor; but of their engagement I do. END
BEGIN NOW I am perfectly satisfied of both. END
BEGIN NOW Yet not a syllable has been said to you on the subject, by either of them. END
BEGIN NOW I have not wanted syllables where actions have spoken so plainly. END
BEGIN NOW Has not his behaviour to Marianne and to all of us, for at least the last fortnight, declared that he loved and considered her as his future wife, and that he felt for us the attachment of the nearest relation? END
BEGIN NOW Have we not perfectly understood each other? END
BEGIN NOW Has not my consent been daily asked by his looks, his manner, his attentive and affectionate respect? END
BEGIN NOW My Elinor, is it possible to doubt their engagement? END
BEGIN NOW How could such a thought occur to you? END
BEGIN NOW How is it to be supposed that Willoughby, persuaded as he must be of your sister's love, should leave her, and leave her perhaps for months, without telling her of his affection;&mdash;that they should part without a mutual exchange of confidence? END
BEGIN NOW I confess, replied Elinor, that every circumstance except ONE is in favour of their engagement; but that ONE is the total silence of both on the subject, and with me it almost outweighs every other. END
BEGIN NOW How strange this is! END
BEGIN NOW You must think wretchedly indeed of Willoughby, if, after all that has openly passed between them, you can doubt the nature of the terms on which they are together. END
BEGIN NOW Has he been acting a part in his behaviour to your sister all this time? END
BEGIN NOW Do you suppose him really indifferent to her? END
BEGIN NOW No, I cannot think that. END
BEGIN NOW He must and does love her I am sure. END
BEGIN NOW But with a strange kind of tenderness, if he can leave her with such indifference, such carelessness of the future, as you attribute to him. END
BEGIN NOW You must remember, my dear mother, that I have never considered this matter as certain. END
BEGIN NOW I have had my doubts, I confess; but they are fainter than they were, and they may soon be entirely done away. END
BEGIN NOW If we find they correspond, every fear of mine will be removed. END
BEGIN NOW A mighty concession indeed! END
BEGIN NOW If you were to see them at the altar, you would suppose they were going to be married. END
BEGIN NOW Ungracious girl! END
BEGIN NOW But I require no such proof. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing in my opinion has ever passed to justify doubt; no secrecy has been attempted; all has been uniformly open and unreserved. END
BEGIN NOW You cannot doubt your sister's wishes. END
BEGIN NOW It must be Willoughby therefore whom you suspect. END
BEGIN NOW But why? END
BEGIN NOW Is he not a man of honour and feeling? END
BEGIN NOW Has there been any inconsistency on his side to create alarm? END
BEGIN NOW can he be deceitful? END
BEGIN NOW I hope not, I believe not, cried Elinor. END
BEGIN NOW I love Willoughby, sincerely love him; and suspicion of his integrity cannot be more painful to yourself than to me. END
BEGIN NOW It has been involuntary, and I will not encourage it. END
BEGIN NOW I was startled, I confess, by the alteration in his manners this morning;&mdash;he did not speak like himself, and did not return your kindness with any cordiality. END
BEGIN NOW But all this may be explained by such a situation of his affairs as you have supposed. END
BEGIN NOW He had just parted from my sister, had seen her leave him in the greatest affliction; and if he felt obliged, from a fear of offending Mrs. Smith, to resist the temptation of returning here soon, and yet aware that by declining your invitation, by saying that he was going away for some time, he should seem to act an ungenerous, a suspicious part by our family, he might well be embarrassed and disturbed. END
BEGIN NOW In such a case, a plain and open avowal of his difficulties would have been more to his honour I think, as well as more consistent with his general character;&mdash;but I will not raise objections against any one's conduct on so illiberal a foundation, as a difference in judgment from myself, or a deviation from what I may think right and consistent. END
BEGIN NOW You speak very properly. END
BEGIN NOW Willoughby certainly does not deserve to be suspected. END
BEGIN NOW Though WE have not known him long, he is no stranger in this part of the world; and who has ever spoken to his disadvantage? END
BEGIN NOW Had he been in a situation to act independently and marry immediately, it might have been odd that he should leave us without acknowledging everything to me at once: but this is not the case. END
BEGIN NOW It is an engagement in some respects not prosperously begun, for their marriage must be at a very uncertain distance; and even secrecy, as far as it can be observed, may now be very advisable. END
BEGIN NOW They were interrupted by the entrance of Margaret; and Elinor was then at liberty to think over the representations of her mother, to acknowledge the probability of many, and hope for the justice of all. END
BEGIN NOW They saw nothing of Marianne till dinner time, when she entered the room and took her place at the table without saying a word. END
BEGIN NOW Her eyes were red and swollen; and it seemed as if her tears were even then restrained with difficulty. END
BEGIN NOW She avoided the looks of them all, could neither eat nor speak, and after some time, on her mother's silently pressing her hand with tender compassion, her small degree of fortitude was quite overcome, she burst into tears and left the room. END
BEGIN NOW This violent oppression of spirits continued the whole evening. END
BEGIN NOW She was without any power, because she was without any desire of command over herself. END
BEGIN NOW The slightest mention of anything relative to Willoughby overpowered her in an instant; and though her family were most anxiously attentive to her comfort, it was impossible for them, if they spoke at all, to keep clear of every subject which her feelings connected with him. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne would have thought herself very inexcusable had she been able to sleep at all the first night after parting from Willoughby. END
BEGIN NOW She would have been ashamed to look her family in the face the next morning, had she not risen from her bed in more need of repose than when she lay down in it. END
BEGIN NOW But the feelings which made such composure a disgrace, left her in no danger of incurring it. END
BEGIN NOW She was awake the whole night, and she wept the greatest part of it. END
BEGIN NOW She got up with a headache, was unable to talk, and unwilling to take any nourishment; giving pain every moment to her mother and sisters, and forbidding all attempt at consolation from either. END
BEGIN NOW Her sensibility was potent enough! END
BEGIN NOW When breakfast was over she walked out by herself, and wandered about the village of Allenham, indulging the recollection of past enjoyment and crying over the present reverse for the chief of the morning. END
BEGIN NOW The evening passed off in the equal indulgence of feeling. END
BEGIN NOW She played over every favourite song that she had been used to play to Willoughby, every air in which their voices had been oftenest joined, and sat at the instrument gazing on every line of music that he had written out for her, till her heart was so heavy that no farther sadness could be gained; and this nourishment of grief was every day applied. END
BEGIN NOW She spent whole hours at the pianoforte alternately singing and crying; her voice often totally suspended by her tears. END
BEGIN NOW In books too, as well as in music, she courted the misery which a contrast between the past and present was certain of giving. END
BEGIN NOW She read nothing but what they had been used to read together. END
BEGIN NOW Such violence of affliction indeed could not be supported for ever; it sunk within a few days into a calmer melancholy; but these employments, to which she daily recurred, her solitary walks and silent meditations, still produced occasional effusions of sorrow as lively as ever. END
BEGIN NOW No letter from Willoughby came; and none seemed expected by Marianne. END
BEGIN NOW Her mother was surprised, and Elinor again became uneasy. END
BEGIN NOW But Mrs. Dashwood could find explanations whenever she wanted them, which at least satisfied herself. END
BEGIN NOW Remember, Elinor, said she, how very often Sir John fetches our letters himself from the post, and carries them to it. END
BEGIN NOW We have already agreed that secrecy may be necessary, and we must acknowledge that it could not be maintained if their correspondence were to pass through Sir John's hands. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor could not deny the truth of this, and she tried to find in it a motive sufficient for their silence. END
BEGIN NOW But there was one method so direct, so simple, and in her opinion so eligible of knowing the real state of the affair, and of instantly removing all mystery, that she could not help suggesting it to her mother. END
BEGIN NOW Why do you not ask Marianne at once, said she, whether she is or she is not engaged to Willoughby? END
BEGIN NOW From you, her mother, and so kind, so indulgent a mother, the question could not give offence. END
BEGIN NOW It would be the natural result of your affection for her. END
BEGIN NOW She used to be all unreserve, and to you more especially. END
BEGIN NOW I would not ask such a question for the world. END
BEGIN NOW Supposing it possible that they are not engaged, what distress would not such an enquiry inflict! END
BEGIN NOW At any rate it would be most ungenerous. END
BEGIN NOW I should never deserve her confidence again, after forcing from her a confession of what is meant at present to be unacknowledged to any one. END
BEGIN NOW I know Marianne's heart: I know that she dearly loves me, and that I shall not be the last to whom the affair is made known, when circumstances make the revealment of it eligible. END
BEGIN NOW I would not attempt to force the confidence of any one; of a child much less; because a sense of duty would prevent the denial which her wishes might direct. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor thought this generosity overstrained, considering her sister's youth, and urged the matter farther, but in vain; common sense, common care, common prudence, were all sunk in Mrs. Dashwood's romantic delicacy. END
BEGIN NOW It was several days before Willoughby's name was mentioned before Marianne by any of her family; Sir John and Mrs. Jennings, indeed, were not so nice; their witticisms added pain to many a painful hour;&mdash;but one evening, Mrs. Dashwood, accidentally taking up a volume of Shakespeare, exclaimed, We have never finished Hamlet, Marianne; our dear Willoughby went away before we could get through it. END
BEGIN NOW We will put it by, that when he comes again...But it may be months, perhaps, before THAT happens. END
BEGIN NOW Months! END
BEGIN NOW cried Marianne, with strong surprise. END
BEGIN NOW No&mdash;nor many weeks. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Dashwood was sorry for what she had said; but it gave Elinor pleasure, as it produced a reply from Marianne so expressive of confidence in Willoughby and knowledge of his intentions. END
BEGIN NOW One morning, about a week after his leaving the country, Marianne was prevailed on to join her sisters in their usual walk, instead of wandering away by herself. END
BEGIN NOW Hitherto she had carefully avoided every companion in her rambles. END
BEGIN NOW If her sisters intended to walk on the downs, she directly stole away towards the lanes; if they talked of the valley, she was as speedy in climbing the hills, and could never be found when the others set off. END
BEGIN NOW But at length she was secured by the exertions of Elinor, who greatly disapproved such continual seclusion. END
BEGIN NOW They walked along the road through the valley, and chiefly in silence, for Marianne's MIND could not be controlled, and Elinor, satisfied with gaining one point, would not then attempt more. END
BEGIN NOW Beyond the entrance of the valley, where the country, though still rich, was less wild and more open, a long stretch of the road which they had travelled on first coming to Barton, lay before them; and on reaching that point, they stopped to look around them, and examine a prospect which formed the distance of their view from the cottage, from a spot which they had never happened to reach in any of their walks before. END
BEGIN NOW Amongst the objects in the scene, they soon discovered an animated one; it was a man on horseback riding towards them. END
BEGIN NOW In a few minutes they could distinguish him to be a gentleman; and in a moment afterwards Marianne rapturously exclaimed, It is he; it is indeed;&mdash;I know it is! END
BEGIN NOW &mdash;and was hastening to meet him, when Elinor cried out, Indeed, Marianne, I think you are mistaken. END
BEGIN NOW It is not Willoughby. END
BEGIN NOW The person is not tall enough for him, and has not his air. END
BEGIN NOW He has, he has, cried Marianne, I am sure he has. END
BEGIN NOW His air, his coat, his horse. END
BEGIN NOW I knew how soon he would come. END
BEGIN NOW She walked eagerly on as she spoke; and Elinor, to screen Marianne from particularity, as she felt almost certain of its not being Willoughby, quickened her pace and kept up with her. END
BEGIN NOW They were soon within thirty yards of the gentleman. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne looked again; her heart sunk within her; and abruptly turning round, she was hurrying back, when the voices of both her sisters were raised to detain her; a third, almost as well known as Willoughby's, joined them in begging her to stop, and she turned round with surprise to see and welcome Edward Ferrars. END
BEGIN NOW He was the only person in the world who could at that moment be forgiven for not being Willoughby; the only one who could have gained a smile from her; but she dispersed her tears to smile on HIM, and in her sister's happiness forgot for a time her own disappointment. END
BEGIN NOW He dismounted, and giving his horse to his servant, walked back with them to Barton, whither he was purposely coming to visit them. END
BEGIN NOW He was welcomed by them all with great cordiality, but especially by Marianne, who showed more warmth of regard in her reception of him than even Elinor herself. END
BEGIN NOW To Marianne, indeed, the meeting between Edward and her sister was but a continuation of that unaccountable coldness which she had often observed at Norland in their mutual behaviour. END
BEGIN NOW On Edward's side, more particularly, there was a deficiency of all that a lover ought to look and say on such an occasion. END
BEGIN NOW He was confused, seemed scarcely sensible of pleasure in seeing them, looked neither rapturous nor gay, said little but what was forced from him by questions, and distinguished Elinor by no mark of affection. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne saw and listened with increasing surprise. END
BEGIN NOW She began almost to feel a dislike of Edward; and it ended, as every feeling must end with her, by carrying back her thoughts to Willoughby, whose manners formed a contrast sufficiently striking to those of his brother elect. END
BEGIN NOW After a short silence which succeeded the first surprise and enquiries of meeting, Marianne asked Edward if he came directly from London. END
BEGIN NOW No, he had been in Devonshire a fortnight. END
BEGIN NOW A fortnight! END
BEGIN NOW she repeated, surprised at his being so long in the same county with Elinor without seeing her before. END
BEGIN NOW He looked rather distressed as he added, that he had been staying with some friends near Plymouth. END
BEGIN NOW Have you been lately in Sussex? END
BEGIN NOW said Elinor. END
BEGIN NOW I was at Norland about a month ago. END
BEGIN NOW And how does dear, dear Norland look? END
BEGIN NOW cried Marianne. END
BEGIN NOW Dear, dear Norland, said Elinor, probably looks much as it always does at this time of the year. END
BEGIN NOW The woods and walks thickly covered with dead leaves. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, cried Marianne, with what transporting sensation have I formerly seen them fall! END
BEGIN NOW How have I delighted, as I walked, to see them driven in showers about me by the wind! END
BEGIN NOW What feelings have they, the season, the air altogether inspired! END
BEGIN NOW Now there is no one to regard them. END
BEGIN NOW They are seen only as a nuisance, swept hastily off, and driven as much as possible from the sight. END
BEGIN NOW It is not every one, said Elinor, who has your passion for dead leaves. END
BEGIN NOW No; my feelings are not often shared, not often understood. END
BEGIN NOW But SOMETIMES they are. END
BEGIN NOW &mdash;As she said this, she sunk into a reverie for a few moments;&mdash;but rousing herself again, Now, Edward, said she, calling his attention to the prospect, here is Barton valley. END
BEGIN NOW Look up to it, and be tranquil if you can. END
BEGIN NOW Look at those hills! END
BEGIN NOW Did you ever see their equals? END
BEGIN NOW To the left is Barton park, amongst those woods and plantations. END
BEGIN NOW You may see the end of the house. END
BEGIN NOW And there, beneath that farthest hill, which rises with such grandeur, is our cottage. END
BEGIN NOW It is a beautiful country, he replied; but these bottoms must be dirty in winter. END
BEGIN NOW How can you think of dirt, with such objects before you? END
BEGIN NOW Because, replied he, smiling, among the rest of the objects before me, I see a very dirty lane. END
BEGIN NOW How strange! END
BEGIN NOW said Marianne to herself as she walked on. END
BEGIN NOW Have you an agreeable neighbourhood here? END
BEGIN NOW Are the Middletons pleasant people? END
BEGIN NOW No, not all, answered Marianne; we could not be more unfortunately situated. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne, cried her sister, how can you say so? END
BEGIN NOW How can you be so unjust? END
BEGIN NOW They are a very respectable family, Mr. Ferrars; and towards us have behaved in the friendliest manner. END
BEGIN NOW Have you forgot, Marianne, how many pleasant days we have owed to them? END
BEGIN NOW No, said Marianne, in a low voice, nor how many painful moments. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor took no notice of this; and directing her attention to their visitor, endeavoured to support something like discourse with him, by talking of their present residence, its conveniences, &c. extorting from him occasional questions and remarks. END
BEGIN NOW His coldness and reserve mortified her severely; she was vexed and half angry; but resolving to regulate her behaviour to him by the past rather than the present, she avoided every appearance of resentment or displeasure, and treated him as she thought he ought to be treated from the family connection. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Dashwood was surprised only for a moment at seeing him; for his coming to Barton was, in her opinion, of all things the most natural. END
BEGIN NOW Her joy and expression of regard long outlived her wonder. END
BEGIN NOW He received the kindest welcome from her; and shyness, coldness, reserve could not stand against such a reception. END
BEGIN NOW They had begun to fail him before he entered the house, and they were quite overcome by the captivating manners of Mrs. Dashwood. END
BEGIN NOW Indeed a man could not very well be in love with either of her daughters, without extending the passion to her; and Elinor had the satisfaction of seeing him soon become more like himself. END
BEGIN NOW His affections seemed to reanimate towards them all, and his interest in their welfare again became perceptible. END
BEGIN NOW He was not in spirits, however; he praised their house, admired its prospect, was attentive, and kind; but still he was not in spirits. END
BEGIN NOW The whole family perceived it, and Mrs. Dashwood, attributing it to some want of liberality in his mother, sat down to table indignant against all selfish parents. END
BEGIN NOW What are Mrs. Ferrars's views for you at present, Edward? END
BEGIN NOW said she, when dinner was over and they had drawn round the fire; are you still to be a great orator in spite of yourself? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW I hope my mother is now convinced that I have no more talents than inclination for a public life! END
BEGIN NOW But how is your fame to be established? END
BEGIN NOW for famous you must be to satisfy all your family; and with no inclination for expense, no affection for strangers, no profession, and no assurance, you may find it a difficult matter. END
BEGIN NOW I shall not attempt it. END
BEGIN NOW I have no wish to be distinguished; and have every reason to hope I never shall. END
BEGIN NOW Thank Heaven! END
BEGIN NOW I cannot be forced into genius and eloquence. END
BEGIN NOW You have no ambition, I well know. END
BEGIN NOW Your wishes are all moderate. END
BEGIN NOW As moderate as those of the rest of the world, I believe. END
BEGIN NOW I wish as well as every body else to be perfectly happy; but, like every body else it must be in my own way. END
BEGIN NOW Greatness will not make me so. END
BEGIN NOW Strange that it would! END
BEGIN NOW cried Marianne. END
BEGIN NOW What have wealth or grandeur to do with happiness? END
BEGIN NOW Grandeur has but little, said Elinor, but wealth has much to do with it. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor, for shame! END
BEGIN NOW said Marianne, money can only give happiness where there is nothing else to give it. END
BEGIN NOW Beyond a competence, it can afford no real satisfaction, as far as mere self is concerned. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps, said Elinor, smiling, we may come to the same point. END
BEGIN NOW YOUR competence and MY wealth are very much alike, I dare say; and without them, as the world goes now, we shall both agree that every kind of external comfort must be wanting. END
BEGIN NOW Your ideas are only more noble than mine. END
BEGIN NOW Come, what is your competence? END
BEGIN NOW About eighteen hundred or two thousand a year; not more than THAT. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor laughed. END
BEGIN NOW TWO thousand a year! END
BEGIN NOW ONE is my wealth! END
BEGIN NOW I guessed how it would end. END
BEGIN NOW And yet two thousand a-year is a very moderate income, said Marianne. END
BEGIN NOW A family cannot well be maintained on a smaller. END
BEGIN NOW I am sure I am not extravagant in my demands. END
BEGIN NOW A proper establishment of servants, a carriage, perhaps two, and hunters, cannot be supported on less. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor smiled again, to hear her sister describing so accurately their future expenses at Combe Magna. END
BEGIN NOW Hunters! END
BEGIN NOW repeated Edward&mdash; but why must you have hunters? END
BEGIN NOW Every body does not hunt. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne coloured as she replied, But most people do. END
BEGIN NOW I wish, said Margaret, striking out a novel thought, that somebody would give us all a large fortune apiece! END
BEGIN NOW Oh that they would! END
BEGIN NOW cried Marianne, her eyes sparkling with animation, and her cheeks glowing with the delight of such imaginary happiness. END
BEGIN NOW We are all unanimous in that wish, I suppose, said Elinor, in spite of the insufficiency of wealth. END
BEGIN NOW Oh dear! END
BEGIN NOW cried Margaret, how happy I should be! END
BEGIN NOW I wonder what I should do with it! END
BEGIN NOW Marianne looked as if she had no doubt on that point. END
BEGIN NOW I should be puzzled to spend so large a fortune myself, said Mrs. Dashwood, if my children were all to be rich without my help. END
BEGIN NOW You must begin your improvements on this house, observed Elinor, and your difficulties will soon vanish. END
BEGIN NOW What magnificent orders would travel from this family to London, said Edward, in such an event! END
BEGIN NOW What a happy day for booksellers, music-sellers, and print-shops! END
BEGIN NOW You, Miss Dashwood, would give a general commission for every new print of merit to be sent you&mdash;and as for Marianne, I know her greatness of soul, there would not be music enough in London to content her. END
BEGIN NOW And books!&mdash;Thomson, Cowper, Scott&mdash;she would buy them all over and over again: she would buy up every copy, I believe, to prevent their falling into unworthy hands; and she would have every book that tells her how to admire an old twisted tree. END
BEGIN NOW Should not you, Marianne? END
BEGIN NOW Forgive me, if I am very saucy. END
BEGIN NOW But I was willing to shew you that I had not forgot our old disputes. END
BEGIN NOW I love to be reminded of the past, Edward&mdash;whether it be melancholy or gay, I love to recall it&mdash;and you will never offend me by talking of former times. END
BEGIN NOW You are very right in supposing how my money would be spent&mdash;some of it, at least&mdash;my loose cash would certainly be employed in improving my collection of music and books. END
BEGIN NOW And the bulk of your fortune would be laid out in annuities on the authors or their heirs. END
BEGIN NOW No, Edward, I should have something else to do with it. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps, then, you would bestow it as a reward on that person who wrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim, that no one can ever be in love more than once in their life&mdash;your opinion on that point is unchanged, I presume? END
BEGIN NOW Undoubtedly. END
BEGIN NOW At my time of life opinions are tolerably fixed. END
BEGIN NOW It is not likely that I should now see or hear any thing to change them. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne is as steadfast as ever, you see, said Elinor, she is not at all altered. END
BEGIN NOW She is only grown a little more grave than she was. END
BEGIN NOW Nay, Edward, said Marianne, you need not reproach me. END
BEGIN NOW You are not very gay yourself. END
BEGIN NOW Why should you think so! END
BEGIN NOW replied he, with a sigh. END
BEGIN NOW But gaiety never was a part of MY character. END
BEGIN NOW Nor do I think it a part of Marianne's, said Elinor; I should hardly call her a lively girl&mdash;she is very earnest, very eager in all she does&mdash;sometimes talks a great deal and always with animation&mdash;but she is not often really merry. END
BEGIN NOW I believe you are right, he replied, and yet I have always set her down as a lively girl. END
BEGIN NOW I have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes, said Elinor, in a total misapprehension of character in some point or other: fancying people so much more gay or grave, or ingenious or stupid than they really are, and I can hardly tell why or in what the deception originated. END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes one is guided by what they say of themselves, and very frequently by what other people say of them, without giving oneself time to deliberate and judge. END
BEGIN NOW But I thought it was right, Elinor, said Marianne, to be guided wholly by the opinion of other people. END
BEGIN NOW I thought our judgments were given us merely to be subservient to those of neighbours. END
BEGIN NOW This has always been your doctrine, I am sure. END
BEGIN NOW No, Marianne, never. END
BEGIN NOW My doctrine has never aimed at the subjection of the understanding. END
BEGIN NOW All I have ever attempted to influence has been the behaviour. END
BEGIN NOW You must not confound my meaning. END
BEGIN NOW I am guilty, I confess, of having often wished you to treat our acquaintance in general with greater attention; but when have I advised you to adopt their sentiments or to conform to their judgment in serious matters? END
BEGIN NOW You have not been able to bring your sister over to your plan of general civility, said Edward to Elinor. END
BEGIN NOW Do you gain no ground? END
BEGIN NOW Quite the contrary, replied Elinor, looking expressively at Marianne. END
BEGIN NOW My judgment, he returned, is all on your side of the question; but I am afraid my practice is much more on your sister's. END
BEGIN NOW I never wish to offend, but I am so foolishly shy, that I often seem negligent, when I am only kept back by my natural awkwardness. END
BEGIN NOW I have frequently thought that I must have been intended by nature to be fond of low company, I am so little at my ease among strangers of gentility! END
BEGIN NOW Marianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention of hers, said Elinor. END
BEGIN NOW She knows her own worth too well for false shame, replied Edward. END
BEGIN NOW Shyness is only the effect of a sense of inferiority in some way or other. END
BEGIN NOW If I could persuade myself that my manners were perfectly easy and graceful, I should not be shy. END
BEGIN NOW But you would still be reserved, said Marianne, and that is worse. END
BEGIN NOW Edward started&mdash; Reserved! END
BEGIN NOW Am I reserved, Marianne? END
BEGIN NOW Yes, very. END
BEGIN NOW I do not understand you, replied he, colouring. END
BEGIN NOW Reserved!&mdash;how, in what manner? END
BEGIN NOW What am I to tell you? END
BEGIN NOW What can you suppose? END
BEGIN NOW Elinor looked surprised at his emotion; but trying to laugh off the subject, she said to him, Do not you know my sister well enough to understand what she means? END
BEGIN NOW Do not you know she calls every one reserved who does not talk as fast, and admire what she admires as rapturously as herself? END
BEGIN NOW Edward made no answer. END
BEGIN NOW His gravity and thoughtfulness returned on him in their fullest extent&mdash;and he sat for some time silent and dull. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor saw, with great uneasiness the low spirits of her friend. END
BEGIN NOW His visit afforded her but a very partial satisfaction, while his own enjoyment in it appeared so imperfect. END
BEGIN NOW It was evident that he was unhappy; she wished it were equally evident that he still distinguished her by the same affection which once she had felt no doubt of inspiring; but hitherto the continuance of his preference seemed very uncertain; and the reservedness of his manner towards her contradicted one moment what a more animated look had intimated the preceding one. END
BEGIN NOW He joined her and Marianne in the breakfast-room the next morning before the others were down; and Marianne, who was always eager to promote their happiness as far as she could, soon left them to themselves. END
BEGIN NOW But before she was half way upstairs she heard the parlour door open, and, turning round, was astonished to see Edward himself come out. END
BEGIN NOW I am going into the village to see my horses, said he, as you are not yet ready for breakfast; I shall be back again presently. END
BEGIN NOW *** Edward returned to them with fresh admiration of the surrounding country; in his walk to the village, he had seen many parts of the valley to advantage; and the village itself, in a much higher situation than the cottage, afforded a general view of the whole, which had exceedingly pleased him. END
BEGIN NOW This was a subject which ensured Marianne's attention, and she was beginning to describe her own admiration of these scenes, and to question him more minutely on the objects that had particularly struck him, when Edward interrupted her by saying, You must not enquire too far, Marianne&mdash;remember I have no knowledge in the picturesque, and I shall offend you by my ignorance and want of taste if we come to particulars. END
BEGIN NOW I shall call hills steep, which ought to be bold; surfaces strange and uncouth, which ought to be irregular and rugged; and distant objects out of sight, which ought only to be indistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere. END
BEGIN NOW You must be satisfied with such admiration as I can honestly give. END
BEGIN NOW I call it a very fine country&mdash;the hills are steep, the woods seem full of fine timber, and the valley looks comfortable and snug&mdash;with rich meadows and several neat farm houses scattered here and there. END
BEGIN NOW It exactly answers my idea of a fine country, because it unites beauty with utility&mdash;and I dare say it is a picturesque one too, because you admire it; I can easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories, grey moss and brush wood, but these are all lost on me. END
BEGIN NOW I know nothing of the picturesque. END
BEGIN NOW I am afraid it is but too true, said Marianne; but why should you boast of it? END
BEGIN NOW I suspect, said Elinor, that to avoid one kind of affectation, Edward here falls into another. END
BEGIN NOW Because he believes many people pretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really feel, and is disgusted with such pretensions, he affects greater indifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than he possesses. END
BEGIN NOW He is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own. END
BEGIN NOW It is very true, said Marianne, that admiration of landscape scenery is become a mere jargon. END
BEGIN NOW Every body pretends to feel and tries to describe with the taste and elegance of him who first defined what picturesque beauty was. END
BEGIN NOW I detest jargon of every kind, and sometimes I have kept my feelings to myself, because I could find no language to describe them in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and meaning. END
BEGIN NOW I am convinced, said Edward, that you really feel all the delight in a fine prospect which you profess to feel. END
BEGIN NOW But, in return, your sister must allow me to feel no more than I profess. END
BEGIN NOW I like a fine prospect, but not on picturesque principles. END
BEGIN NOW I do not like crooked, twisted, blasted trees. END
BEGIN NOW I admire them much more if they are tall, straight, and flourishing. END
BEGIN NOW I do not like ruined, tattered cottages. END
BEGIN NOW I am not fond of nettles or thistles, or heath blossoms. END
BEGIN NOW I have more pleasure in a snug farm-house than a watch-tower&mdash;and a troop of tidy, happy villages please me better than the finest banditti in the world. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne looked with amazement at Edward, with compassion at her sister. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor only laughed. END
BEGIN NOW The subject was continued no farther; and Marianne remained thoughtfully silent, till a new object suddenly engaged her attention. END
BEGIN NOW She was sitting by Edward, and in taking his tea from Mrs. Dashwood, his hand passed so directly before her, as to make a ring, with a plait of hair in the centre, very conspicuous on one of his fingers. END
BEGIN NOW I never saw you wear a ring before, Edward, she cried. END
BEGIN NOW Is that Fanny's hair? END
BEGIN NOW I remember her promising to give you some. END
BEGIN NOW But I should have thought her hair had been darker. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne spoke inconsiderately what she really felt&mdash;but when she saw how much she had pained Edward, her own vexation at her want of thought could not be surpassed by his. END
BEGIN NOW He coloured very deeply, and giving a momentary glance at Elinor, replied, Yes; it is my sister's hair. END
BEGIN NOW The setting always casts a different shade on it, you know. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor had met his eye, and looked conscious likewise. END
BEGIN NOW That the hair was her own, she instantaneously felt as well satisfied as Marianne; the only difference in their conclusions was, that what Marianne considered as a free gift from her sister, Elinor was conscious must have been procured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself. END
BEGIN NOW She was not in a humour, however, to regard it as an affront, and affecting to take no notice of what passed, by instantly talking of something else, she internally resolved henceforward to catch every opportunity of eyeing the hair and of satisfying herself, beyond all doubt, that it was exactly the shade of her own. END
BEGIN NOW Edward's embarrassment lasted some time, and it ended in an absence of mind still more settled. END
BEGIN NOW He was particularly grave the whole morning. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne severely censured herself for what she had said; but her own forgiveness might have been more speedy, had she known how little offence it had given her sister. END
BEGIN NOW Before the middle of the day, they were visited by Sir John and Mrs. Jennings, who, having heard of the arrival of a gentleman at the cottage, came to take a survey of the guest. END
BEGIN NOW With the assistance of his mother-in-law, Sir John was not long in discovering that the name of Ferrars began with an F. and this prepared a future mine of raillery against the devoted Elinor, which nothing but the newness of their acquaintance with Edward could have prevented from being immediately sprung. END
BEGIN NOW But, as it was, she only learned, from some very significant looks, how far their penetration, founded on Margaret's instructions, extended. END
BEGIN NOW Sir John never came to the Dashwoods without either inviting them to dine at the park the next day, or to drink tea with them that evening. END
BEGIN NOW On the present occasion, for the better entertainment of their visitor, towards whose amusement he felt himself bound to contribute, he wished to engage them for both. END
BEGIN NOW You MUST drink tea with us to night, said he, for we shall be quite alone&mdash;and tomorrow you must absolutely dine with us, for we shall be a large party. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Jennings enforced the necessity. END
BEGIN NOW And who knows but you may raise a dance, said she. END
BEGIN NOW And that will tempt YOU, Miss Marianne. END
BEGIN NOW A dance! END
BEGIN NOW cried Marianne. END
BEGIN NOW Impossible! END
BEGIN NOW Who is to dance? END
BEGIN NOW Who! END
BEGIN NOW why yourselves, and the Careys, and Whitakers to be sure.&mdash;What! END
BEGIN NOW you thought nobody could dance because a certain person that shall be nameless is gone! END
BEGIN NOW I wish with all my soul, cried Sir John, that Willoughby were among us again. END
BEGIN NOW This, and Marianne's blushing, gave new suspicions to Edward. END
BEGIN NOW And who is Willoughby? END
BEGIN NOW said he, in a low voice, to Miss Dashwood, by whom he was sitting. END
BEGIN NOW She gave him a brief reply. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne's countenance was more communicative. END
BEGIN NOW Edward saw enough to comprehend, not only the meaning of others, but such of Marianne's expressions as had puzzled him before; and when their visitors left them, he went immediately round her, and said, in a whisper, I have been guessing. END
BEGIN NOW Shall I tell you my guess? END
BEGIN NOW What do you mean? END
BEGIN NOW Shall I tell you. END
BEGIN NOW Certainly. END
BEGIN NOW Well then; I guess that Mr. Willoughby hunts. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne was surprised and confused, yet she could not help smiling at the quiet archness of his manner, and after a moment's silence, said, Oh, Edward! END
BEGIN NOW How can you?&mdash;But the time will come I hope...I am sure you will like him. END
BEGIN NOW I do not doubt it, replied he, rather astonished at her earnestness and warmth; for had he not imagined it to be a joke for the good of her acquaintance in general, founded only on a something or a nothing between Mr. Willoughby and herself, he would not have ventured to mention it. END
BEGIN NOW Edward remained a week at the cottage; he was earnestly pressed by Mrs. Dashwood to stay longer; but, as if he were bent only on self-mortification, he seemed resolved to be gone when his enjoyment among his friends was at the height. END
BEGIN NOW His spirits, during the last two or three days, though still very unequal, were greatly improved&mdash;he grew more and more partial to the house and environs&mdash;never spoke of going away without a sigh&mdash;declared his time to be wholly disengaged&mdash;even doubted to what place he should go when he left them&mdash;but still, go he must. END
BEGIN NOW Never had any week passed so quickly&mdash;he could hardly believe it to be gone. END
BEGIN NOW He said so repeatedly; other things he said too, which marked the turn of his feelings and gave the lie to his actions. END
BEGIN NOW He had no pleasure at Norland; he detested being in town; but either to Norland or London, he must go. END
BEGIN NOW He valued their kindness beyond any thing, and his greatest happiness was in being with them. END
BEGIN NOW Yet, he must leave them at the end of a week, in spite of their wishes and his own, and without any restraint on his time. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor placed all that was astonishing in this way of acting to his mother's account; and it was happy for her that he had a mother whose character was so imperfectly known to her, as to be the general excuse for every thing strange on the part of her son. END
BEGIN NOW Disappointed, however, and vexed as she was, and sometimes displeased with his uncertain behaviour to herself, she was very well disposed on the whole to regard his actions with all the candid allowances and generous qualifications, which had been rather more painfully extorted from her, for Willoughby's service, by her mother. END
BEGIN NOW His want of spirits, of openness, and of consistency, were most usually attributed to his want of independence, and his better knowledge of Mrs. Ferrars's disposition and designs. END
BEGIN NOW The shortness of his visit, the steadiness of his purpose in leaving them, originated in the same fettered inclination, the same inevitable necessity of temporizing with his mother. END
BEGIN NOW The old well-established grievance of duty against will, parent against child, was the cause of all. END
BEGIN NOW She would have been glad to know when these difficulties were to cease, this opposition was to yield,&mdash;when Mrs. Ferrars would be reformed, and her son be at liberty to be happy. END
BEGIN NOW But from such vain wishes she was forced to turn for comfort to the renewal of her confidence in Edward's affection, to the remembrance of every mark of regard in look or word which fell from him while at Barton, and above all to that flattering proof of it which he constantly wore round his finger. END
BEGIN NOW I think, Edward, said Mrs. Dashwood, as they were at breakfast the last morning, you would be a happier man if you had any profession to engage your time and give an interest to your plans and actions. END
BEGIN NOW Some inconvenience to your friends, indeed, might result from it&mdash;you would not be able to give them so much of your time. END
BEGIN NOW But (with a smile) you would be materially benefited in one particular at least&mdash;you would know where to go when you left them. END
BEGIN NOW I do assure you, he replied, that I have long thought on this point, as you think now. END
BEGIN NOW It has been, and is, and probably will always be a heavy misfortune to me, that I have had no necessary business to engage me, no profession to give me employment, or afford me any thing like independence. END
BEGIN NOW But unfortunately my own nicety, and the nicety of my friends, have made me what I am, an idle, helpless being. END
BEGIN NOW We never could agree in our choice of a profession. END
BEGIN NOW I always preferred the church, as I still do. END
BEGIN NOW But that was not smart enough for my family. END
BEGIN NOW They recommended the army. END
BEGIN NOW That was a great deal too smart for me. END
BEGIN NOW The law was allowed to be genteel enough; many young men, who had chambers in the Temple, made a very good appearance in the first circles, and drove about town in very knowing gigs. END
BEGIN NOW But I had no inclination for the law, even in this less abstruse study of it, which my family approved. END
BEGIN NOW As for the navy, it had fashion on its side, but I was too old when the subject was first started to enter it&mdash;and, at length, as there was no necessity for my having any profession at all, as I might be as dashing and expensive without a red coat on my back as with one, idleness was pronounced on the whole to be most advantageous and honourable, and a young man of eighteen is not in general so earnestly bent on being busy as to resist the solicitations of his friends to do nothing. END
BEGIN NOW I was therefore entered at Oxford and have been properly idle ever since. END
BEGIN NOW The consequence of which, I suppose, will be, said Mrs. Dashwood, since leisure has not promoted your own happiness, that your sons will be brought up to as many pursuits, employments, professions, and trades as Columella's. END
BEGIN NOW They will be brought up, said he, in a serious accent, to be as unlike myself as is possible. END
BEGIN NOW In feeling, in action, in condition, in every thing. END
BEGIN NOW Come, come; this is all an effusion of immediate want of spirits, Edward. END
BEGIN NOW You are in a melancholy humour, and fancy that any one unlike yourself must be happy. END
BEGIN NOW But remember that the pain of parting from friends will be felt by every body at times, whatever be their education or state. END
BEGIN NOW Know your own happiness. END
BEGIN NOW You want nothing but patience&mdash;or give it a more fascinating name, call it hope. END
BEGIN NOW Your mother will secure to you, in time, that independence you are so anxious for; it is her duty, and it will, it must ere long become her happiness to prevent your whole youth from being wasted in discontent. END
BEGIN NOW How much may not a few months do? END
BEGIN NOW I think, replied Edward, that I may defy many months to produce any good to me. END
BEGIN NOW This desponding turn of mind, though it could not be communicated to Mrs. Dashwood, gave additional pain to them all in the parting, which shortly took place, and left an uncomfortable impression on Elinor's feelings especially, which required some trouble and time to subdue. END
BEGIN NOW But as it was her determination to subdue it, and to prevent herself from appearing to suffer more than what all her family suffered on his going away, she did not adopt the method so judiciously employed by Marianne, on a similar occasion, to augment and fix her sorrow, by seeking silence, solitude and idleness. END
BEGIN NOW Their means were as different as their objects, and equally suited to the advancement of each. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor sat down to her drawing-table as soon as he was out of the house, busily employed herself the whole day, neither sought nor avoided the mention of his name, appeared to interest herself almost as much as ever in the general concerns of the family, and if, by this conduct, she did not lessen her own grief, it was at least prevented from unnecessary increase, and her mother and sisters were spared much solicitude on her account. END
BEGIN NOW Such behaviour as this, so exactly the reverse of her own, appeared no more meritorious to Marianne, than her own had seemed faulty to her. END
BEGIN NOW The business of self-command she settled very easily;&mdash;with strong affections it was impossible, with calm ones it could have no merit. END
BEGIN NOW That her sister's affections WERE calm, she dared not deny, though she blushed to acknowledge it; and of the strength of her own, she gave a very striking proof, by still loving and respecting that sister, in spite of this mortifying conviction. END
BEGIN NOW Without shutting herself up from her family, or leaving the house in determined solitude to avoid them, or lying awake the whole night to indulge meditation, Elinor found every day afforded her leisure enough to think of Edward, and of Edward's behaviour, in every possible variety which the different state of her spirits at different times could produce,&mdash;with tenderness, pity, approbation, censure, and doubt. END
BEGIN NOW There were moments in abundance, when, if not by the absence of her mother and sisters, at least by the nature of their employments, conversation was forbidden among them, and every effect of solitude was produced. END
BEGIN NOW Her mind was inevitably at liberty; her thoughts could not be chained elsewhere; and the past and the future, on a subject so interesting, must be before her, must force her attention, and engross her memory, her reflection, and her fancy. END
BEGIN NOW From a reverie of this kind, as she sat at her drawing-table, she was roused one morning, soon after Edward's leaving them, by the arrival of company. END
BEGIN NOW She happened to be quite alone. END
BEGIN NOW The closing of the little gate, at the entrance of the green court in front of the house, drew her eyes to the window, and she saw a large party walking up to the door. END
BEGIN NOW Amongst them were Sir John and Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings, but there were two others, a gentleman and lady, who were quite unknown to her. END
BEGIN NOW She was sitting near the window, and as soon as Sir John perceived her, he left the rest of the party to the ceremony of knocking at the door, and stepping across the turf, obliged her to open the casement to speak to him, though the space was so short between the door and the window, as to make it hardly possible to speak at one without being heard at the other. END
BEGIN NOW Well, said he, we have brought you some strangers. END
BEGIN NOW How do you like them? END
BEGIN NOW Hush! END
BEGIN NOW they will hear you. END
BEGIN NOW Never mind if they do. END
BEGIN NOW It is only the Palmers. END
BEGIN NOW Charlotte is very pretty, I can tell you. END
BEGIN NOW You may see her if you look this way. END
BEGIN NOW As Elinor was certain of seeing her in a couple of minutes, without taking that liberty, she begged to be excused. END
BEGIN NOW Where is Marianne? END
BEGIN NOW Has she run away because we are come? END
BEGIN NOW I see her instrument is open. END
BEGIN NOW She is walking, I believe. END
BEGIN NOW They were now joined by Mrs. Jennings, who had not patience enough to wait till the door was opened before she told HER story. END
BEGIN NOW She came hallooing to the window, How do you do, my dear? END
BEGIN NOW How does Mrs. Dashwood do? END
BEGIN NOW And where are your sisters? END
BEGIN NOW What! END
BEGIN NOW all alone! END
BEGIN NOW you will be glad of a little company to sit with you. END
BEGIN NOW I have brought my other son and daughter to see you. END
BEGIN NOW Only think of their coming so suddenly! END
BEGIN NOW I thought I heard a carriage last night, while we were drinking our tea, but it never entered my head that it could be them. END
BEGIN NOW I thought of nothing but whether it might not be Colonel Brandon come back again; so I said to Sir John, I do think I hear a carriage; perhaps it is Colonel Brandon come back again &mdash; Elinor was obliged to turn from her, in the middle of her story, to receive the rest of the party; Lady Middleton introduced the two strangers; Mrs. Dashwood and Margaret came down stairs at the same time, and they all sat down to look at one another, while Mrs. Jennings continued her story as she walked through the passage into the parlour, attended by Sir John. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Palmer was several years younger than Lady Middleton, and totally unlike her in every respect. END
BEGIN NOW She was short and plump, had a very pretty face, and the finest expression of good humour in it that could possibly be. END
BEGIN NOW Her manners were by no means so elegant as her sister's, but they were much more prepossessing. END
BEGIN NOW She came in with a smile, smiled all the time of her visit, except when she laughed, and smiled when she went away. END
BEGIN NOW Her husband was a grave looking young man of five or six and twenty, with an air of more fashion and sense than his wife, but of less willingness to please or be pleased. END
BEGIN NOW He entered the room with a look of self-consequence, slightly bowed to the ladies, without speaking a word, and, after briefly surveying them and their apartments, took up a newspaper from the table, and continued to read it as long as he staid. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Palmer, on the contrary, who was strongly endowed by nature with a turn for being uniformly civil and happy, was hardly seated before her admiration of the parlour and every thing in it burst forth. END
BEGIN NOW Well! END
BEGIN NOW what a delightful room this is! END
BEGIN NOW I never saw anything so charming! END
BEGIN NOW Only think, Mama, how it is improved since I was here last! END
BEGIN NOW I always thought it such a sweet place, ma'am! END
BEGIN NOW (turning to Mrs. Dashwood) but you have made it so charming! END
BEGIN NOW Only look, sister, how delightful every thing is! END
BEGIN NOW How I should like such a house for myself! END
BEGIN NOW Should not you, Mr. Palmer? END
BEGIN NOW Mr. Palmer made her no answer, and did not even raise his eyes from the newspaper. END
BEGIN NOW Mr. Palmer does not hear me, said she, laughing; he never does sometimes. END
BEGIN NOW It is so ridiculous! END
BEGIN NOW This was quite a new idea to Mrs. Dashwood; she had never been used to find wit in the inattention of any one, and could not help looking with surprise at them both. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Jennings, in the meantime, talked on as loud as she could, and continued her account of their surprise, the evening before, on seeing their friends, without ceasing till every thing was told. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Palmer laughed heartily at the recollection of their astonishment, and every body agreed, two or three times over, that it had been quite an agreeable surprise. END
BEGIN NOW You may believe how glad we all were to see them, added Mrs. Jennings, leaning forward towards Elinor, and speaking in a low voice as if she meant to be heard by no one else, though they were seated on different sides of the room; but, however, I can't help wishing they had not travelled quite so fast, nor made such a long journey of it, for they came all round by London upon account of some business, for you know (nodding significantly and pointing to her daughter) it was wrong in her situation. END
BEGIN NOW I wanted her to stay at home and rest this morning, but she would come with us; she longed so much to see you all! END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Palmer laughed, and said it would not do her any harm. END
BEGIN NOW She expects to be confined in February, continued Mrs. Jennings. END
BEGIN NOW Lady Middleton could no longer endure such a conversation, and therefore exerted herself to ask Mr. Palmer if there was any news in the paper. END
BEGIN NOW No, none at all, he replied, and read on. END
BEGIN NOW Here comes Marianne, cried Sir John. END
BEGIN NOW Now, Palmer, you shall see a monstrous pretty girl. END
BEGIN NOW He immediately went into the passage, opened the front door, and ushered her in himself. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Jennings asked her, as soon as she appeared, if she had not been to Allenham; and Mrs. Palmer laughed so heartily at the question, as to show she understood it. END
BEGIN NOW Mr. Palmer looked up on her entering the room, stared at her some minutes, and then returned to his newspaper. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Palmer's eye was now caught by the drawings which hung round the room. END
BEGIN NOW She got up to examine them. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW dear, how beautiful these are! END
BEGIN NOW Well! END
BEGIN NOW how delightful! END
BEGIN NOW Do but look, mama, how sweet! END
BEGIN NOW I declare they are quite charming; I could look at them for ever. END
BEGIN NOW And then sitting down again, she very soon forgot that there were any such things in the room. END
BEGIN NOW When Lady Middleton rose to go away, Mr. Palmer rose also, laid down the newspaper, stretched himself and looked at them all around. END
BEGIN NOW My love, have you been asleep? END
BEGIN NOW said his wife, laughing. END
BEGIN NOW He made her no answer; and only observed, after again examining the room, that it was very low pitched, and that the ceiling was crooked. END
BEGIN NOW He then made his bow, and departed with the rest. END
BEGIN NOW Sir John had been very urgent with them all to spend the next day at the park. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Dashwood, who did not chuse to dine with them oftener than they dined at the cottage, absolutely refused on her own account; her daughters might do as they pleased. END
BEGIN NOW But they had no curiosity to see how Mr. and Mrs. Palmer ate their dinner, and no expectation of pleasure from them in any other way. END
BEGIN NOW They attempted, therefore, likewise, to excuse themselves; the weather was uncertain, and not likely to be good. END
BEGIN NOW But Sir John would not be satisfied&mdash;the carriage should be sent for them and they must come. END
BEGIN NOW Lady Middleton too, though she did not press their mother, pressed them. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Jennings and Mrs. Palmer joined their entreaties, all seemed equally anxious to avoid a family party; and the young ladies were obliged to yield. END
BEGIN NOW Why should they ask us? END
BEGIN NOW said Marianne, as soon as they were gone. END
BEGIN NOW The rent of this cottage is said to be low; but we have it on very hard terms, if we are to dine at the park whenever any one is staying either with them, or with us. END
BEGIN NOW They mean no less to be civil and kind to us now, said Elinor, by these frequent invitations, than by those which we received from them a few weeks ago. END
BEGIN NOW The alteration is not in them, if their parties are grown tedious and dull. END
BEGIN NOW We must look for the change elsewhere. END
BEGIN NOW As the Miss Dashwoods entered the drawing-room of the park the next day, at one door, Mrs. Palmer came running in at the other, looking as good humoured and merry as before. END
BEGIN NOW She took them all most affectionately by the hand, and expressed great delight in seeing them again. END
BEGIN NOW I am so glad to see you! END
BEGIN NOW said she, seating herself between Elinor and Marianne, for it is so bad a day I was afraid you might not come, which would be a shocking thing, as we go away again tomorrow. END
BEGIN NOW We must go, for the Westons come to us next week you know. END
BEGIN NOW It was quite a sudden thing our coming at all, and I knew nothing of it till the carriage was coming to the door, and then Mr. Palmer asked me if I would go with him to Barton. END
BEGIN NOW He is so droll! END
BEGIN NOW He never tells me any thing! END
BEGIN NOW I am so sorry we cannot stay longer; however we shall meet again in town very soon, I hope. END
BEGIN NOW They were obliged to put an end to such an expectation. END
BEGIN NOW Not go to town! END
BEGIN NOW cried Mrs. Palmer, with a laugh, I shall be quite disappointed if you do not. END
BEGIN NOW I could get the nicest house in the world for you, next door to ours, in Hanover-square. END
BEGIN NOW You must come, indeed. END
BEGIN NOW I am sure I shall be very happy to chaperon you at any time till I am confined, if Mrs. Dashwood should not like to go into public. END
BEGIN NOW They thanked her; but were obliged to resist all her entreaties. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, my love, cried Mrs. Palmer to her husband, who just then entered the room&mdash; you must help me to persuade the Miss Dashwoods to go to town this winter. END
BEGIN NOW Her love made no answer; and after slightly bowing to the ladies, began complaining of the weather. END
BEGIN NOW How horrid all this is! END
BEGIN NOW said he. END
BEGIN NOW Such weather makes every thing and every body disgusting. END
BEGIN NOW Dullness is as much produced within doors as without, by rain. END
BEGIN NOW It makes one detest all one's acquaintance. END
BEGIN NOW What the devil does Sir John mean by not having a billiard room in his house? END
BEGIN NOW How few people know what comfort is! END
BEGIN NOW Sir John is as stupid as the weather. END
BEGIN NOW The rest of the company soon dropt in. END
BEGIN NOW I am afraid, Miss Marianne, said Sir John, you have not been able to take your usual walk to Allenham today. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne looked very grave and said nothing. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, don't be so sly before us, said Mrs. Palmer; for we know all about it, I assure you; and I admire your taste very much, for I think he is extremely handsome. END
BEGIN NOW We do not live a great way from him in the country, you know. END
BEGIN NOW Not above ten miles, I dare say. END
BEGIN NOW Much nearer thirty, said her husband. END
BEGIN NOW Ah, well! END
BEGIN NOW there is not much difference. END
BEGIN NOW I never was at his house; but they say it is a sweet pretty place. END
BEGIN NOW As vile a spot as I ever saw in my life, said Mr. Palmer. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne remained perfectly silent, though her countenance betrayed her interest in what was said. END
BEGIN NOW Is it very ugly? END
BEGIN NOW continued Mrs. Palmer&mdash; then it must be some other place that is so pretty I suppose. END
BEGIN NOW When they were seated in the dining room, Sir John observed with regret that they were only eight all together. END
BEGIN NOW My dear, said he to his lady, it is very provoking that we should be so few. END
BEGIN NOW Why did not you ask the Gilberts to come to us today? END
BEGIN NOW Did not I tell you, Sir John, when you spoke to me about it before, that it could not be done? END
BEGIN NOW They dined with us last. END
BEGIN NOW You and I, Sir John, said Mrs. Jennings, should not stand upon such ceremony. END
BEGIN NOW Then you would be very ill-bred, cried Mr. Palmer. END
BEGIN NOW My love you contradict every body, said his wife with her usual laugh. END
BEGIN NOW Do you know that you are quite rude? END
BEGIN NOW I did not know I contradicted any body in calling your mother ill-bred. END
BEGIN NOW Ay, you may abuse me as you please, said the good-natured old lady, you have taken Charlotte off my hands, and cannot give her back again. END
BEGIN NOW So there I have the whip hand of you. END
BEGIN NOW Charlotte laughed heartily to think that her husband could not get rid of her; and exultingly said, she did not care how cross he was to her, as they must live together. END
BEGIN NOW It was impossible for any one to be more thoroughly good-natured, or more determined to be happy than Mrs. Palmer. END
BEGIN NOW The studied indifference, insolence, and discontent of her husband gave her no pain; and when he scolded or abused her, she was highly diverted. END
BEGIN NOW Mr. Palmer is so droll! END
BEGIN NOW said she, in a whisper, to Elinor. END
BEGIN NOW He is always out of humour. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor was not inclined, after a little observation, to give him credit for being so genuinely and unaffectedly ill-natured or ill-bred as he wished to appear. END
BEGIN NOW His temper might perhaps be a little soured by finding, like many others of his sex, that through some unaccountable bias in favour of beauty, he was the husband of a very silly woman,&mdash;but she knew that this kind of blunder was too common for any sensible man to be lastingly hurt by it.&mdash; It was rather a wish of distinction, she believed, which produced his contemptuous treatment of every body, and his general abuse of every thing before him. END
BEGIN NOW It was the desire of appearing superior to other people. END
BEGIN NOW The motive was too common to be wondered at; but the means, however they might succeed by establishing his superiority in ill-breeding, were not likely to attach any one to him except his wife. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, my dear Miss Dashwood, said Mrs. Palmer soon afterwards, I have got such a favour to ask of you and your sister. END
BEGIN NOW Will you come and spend some time at Cleveland this Christmas? END
BEGIN NOW Now, pray do,&mdash;and come while the Westons are with us. END
BEGIN NOW You cannot think how happy I shall be! END
BEGIN NOW It will be quite delightful!&mdash;My love, applying to her husband, don't you long to have the Miss Dashwoods come to Cleveland? END
BEGIN NOW Certainly, he replied, with a sneer&mdash; I came into Devonshire with no other view. END
BEGIN NOW There now, &mdash;said his lady, you see Mr. Palmer expects you; so you cannot refuse to come. END
BEGIN NOW They both eagerly and resolutely declined her invitation. END
BEGIN NOW But indeed you must and shall come. END
BEGIN NOW I am sure you will like it of all things. END
BEGIN NOW The Westons will be with us, and it will be quite delightful. END
BEGIN NOW You cannot think what a sweet place Cleveland is; and we are so gay now, for Mr. Palmer is always going about the country canvassing against the election; and so many people came to dine with us that I never saw before, it is quite charming! END
BEGIN NOW But, poor fellow! END
BEGIN NOW it is very fatiguing to him! END
BEGIN NOW for he is forced to make every body like him. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor could hardly keep her countenance as she assented to the hardship of such an obligation. END
BEGIN NOW How charming it will be, said Charlotte, when he is in Parliament!&mdash;won't it? END
BEGIN NOW How I shall laugh! END
BEGIN NOW It will be so ridiculous to see all his letters directed to him with an M.P.&mdash;But do you know, he says, he will never frank for me? END
BEGIN NOW He declares he won't. END
BEGIN NOW Don't you, Mr. Palmer? END
BEGIN NOW Mr. Palmer took no notice of her. END
BEGIN NOW He cannot bear writing, you know, she continued&mdash; he says it is quite shocking. END
BEGIN NOW No, said he, I never said any thing so irrational. END
BEGIN NOW Don't palm all your abuses of languages upon me. END
BEGIN NOW There now; you see how droll he is. END
BEGIN NOW This is always the way with him! END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes he won't speak to me for half a day together, and then he comes out with something so droll&mdash;all about any thing in the world. END
BEGIN NOW She surprised Elinor very much as they returned into the drawing-room, by asking her whether she did not like Mr. Palmer excessively. END
BEGIN NOW Certainly, said Elinor; he seems very agreeable. END
BEGIN NOW Well&mdash;I am so glad you do. END
BEGIN NOW I thought you would, he is so pleasant; and Mr. Palmer is excessively pleased with you and your sisters I can tell you, and you can't think how disappointed he will be if you don't come to Cleveland.&mdash;I can't imagine why you should object to it. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor was again obliged to decline her invitation; and by changing the subject, put a stop to her entreaties. END
BEGIN NOW She thought it probable that as they lived in the same county, Mrs. Palmer might be able to give some more particular account of Willoughby's general character, than could be gathered from the Middletons' partial acquaintance with him; and she was eager to gain from any one, such a confirmation of his merits as might remove the possibility of fear from Marianne. END
BEGIN NOW She began by inquiring if they saw much of Mr. Willoughby at Cleveland, and whether they were intimately acquainted with him. END
BEGIN NOW Oh dear, yes; I know him extremely well, replied Mrs. Palmer;&mdash; Not that I ever spoke to him, indeed; but I have seen him for ever in town. END
BEGIN NOW Somehow or other I never happened to be staying at Barton while he was at Allenham. END
BEGIN NOW Mama saw him here once before;&mdash;but I was with my uncle at Weymouth. END
BEGIN NOW However, I dare say we should have seen a great deal of him in Somersetshire, if it had not happened very unluckily that we should never have been in the country together. END
BEGIN NOW He is very little at Combe, I believe; but if he were ever so much there, I do not think Mr. Palmer would visit him, for he is in the opposition, you know, and besides it is such a way off. END
BEGIN NOW I know why you inquire about him, very well; your sister is to marry him. END
BEGIN NOW I am monstrous glad of it, for then I shall have her for a neighbour you know. END
BEGIN NOW Upon my word, replied Elinor, you know much more of the matter than I do, if you have any reason to expect such a match. END
BEGIN NOW Don't pretend to deny it, because you know it is what every body talks of. END
BEGIN NOW I assure you I heard of it in my way through town. END
BEGIN NOW My dear Mrs. Palmer! END
BEGIN NOW Upon my honour I did.&mdash;I met Colonel Brandon Monday morning in Bond-street, just before we left town, and he told me of it directly. END
BEGIN NOW You surprise me very much. END
BEGIN NOW Colonel Brandon tell you of it! END
BEGIN NOW Surely you must be mistaken. END
BEGIN NOW To give such intelligence to a person who could not be interested in it, even if it were true, is not what I should expect Colonel Brandon to do. END
BEGIN NOW But I do assure you it was so, for all that, and I will tell you how it happened. END
BEGIN NOW When we met him, he turned back and walked with us; and so we began talking of my brother and sister, and one thing and another, and I said to him, 'So, Colonel, there is a new family come to Barton cottage, I hear, and mama sends me word they are very pretty, and that one of them is going to be married to Mr. Willoughby of Combe Magna. END
BEGIN NOW Is it true, pray? END
BEGIN NOW for of course you must know, as you have been in Devonshire so lately.' END
BEGIN NOW And what did the Colonel say? END
BEGIN NOW Oh&mdash;he did not say much; but he looked as if he knew it to be true, so from that moment I set it down as certain. END
BEGIN NOW It will be quite delightful, I declare! END
BEGIN NOW When is it to take place? END
BEGIN NOW Mr. Brandon was very well I hope? END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW yes, quite well; and so full of your praises, he did nothing but say fine things of you. END
BEGIN NOW I am flattered by his commendation. END
BEGIN NOW He seems an excellent man; and I think him uncommonly pleasing. END
BEGIN NOW So do I.&mdash;He is such a charming man, that it is quite a pity he should be so grave and so dull. END
BEGIN NOW Mama says HE was in love with your sister too.&mdash; I assure you it was a great compliment if he was, for he hardly ever falls in love with any body. END
BEGIN NOW Is Mr. Willoughby much known in your part of Somersetshire? END
BEGIN NOW said Elinor. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW yes, extremely well; that is, I do not believe many people are acquainted with him, because Combe Magna is so far off; but they all think him extremely agreeable I assure you. END
BEGIN NOW Nobody is more liked than Mr. Willoughby wherever he goes, and so you may tell your sister. END
BEGIN NOW She is a monstrous lucky girl to get him, upon my honour; not but that he is much more lucky in getting her, because she is so very handsome and agreeable, that nothing can be good enough for her. END
BEGIN NOW However, I don't think her hardly at all handsomer than you, I assure you; for I think you both excessively pretty, and so does Mr. Palmer too I am sure, though we could not get him to own it last night. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Palmer's information respecting Willoughby was not very material; but any testimony in his favour, however small, was pleasing to her. END
BEGIN NOW I am so glad we are got acquainted at last, continued Charlotte.&mdash; And now I hope we shall always be great friends. END
BEGIN NOW You can't think how much I longed to see you! END
BEGIN NOW It is so delightful that you should live at the cottage! END
BEGIN NOW Nothing can be like it, to be sure! END
BEGIN NOW And I am so glad your sister is going to be well married! END
BEGIN NOW I hope you will be a great deal at Combe Magna. END
BEGIN NOW It is a sweet place, by all accounts. END
BEGIN NOW You have been long acquainted with Colonel Brandon, have not you? END
BEGIN NOW Yes, a great while; ever since my sister married.&mdash; He was a particular friend of Sir John's. END
BEGIN NOW I believe, she added in a low voice, he would have been very glad to have had me, if he could. END
BEGIN NOW Sir John and Lady Middleton wished it very much. END
BEGIN NOW But mama did not think the match good enough for me, otherwise Sir John would have mentioned it to the Colonel, and we should have been married immediately. END
BEGIN NOW Did not Colonel Brandon know of Sir John's proposal to your mother before it was made? END
BEGIN NOW Had he never owned his affection to yourself? END
BEGIN NOW Oh, no; but if mama had not objected to it, I dare say he would have liked it of all things. END
BEGIN NOW He had not seen me then above twice, for it was before I left school. END
BEGIN NOW However, I am much happier as I am. END
BEGIN NOW Mr. Palmer is the kind of man I like. END
BEGIN NOW The Palmers returned to Cleveland the next day, and the two families at Barton were again left to entertain each other. END
BEGIN NOW But this did not last long; Elinor had hardly got their last visitors out of her head, had hardly done wondering at Charlotte's being so happy without a cause, at Mr. Palmer's acting so simply, with good abilities, and at the strange unsuitableness which often existed between husband and wife, before Sir John's and Mrs. Jennings's active zeal in the cause of society, procured her some other new acquaintance to see and observe. END
BEGIN NOW In a morning's excursion to Exeter, they had met with two young ladies, whom Mrs. Jennings had the satisfaction of discovering to be her relations, and this was enough for Sir John to invite them directly to the park, as soon as their present engagements at Exeter were over. END
BEGIN NOW Their engagements at Exeter instantly gave way before such an invitation, and Lady Middleton was thrown into no little alarm on the return of Sir John, by hearing that she was very soon to receive a visit from two girls whom she had never seen in her life, and of whose elegance,&mdash;whose tolerable gentility even, she could have no proof; for the assurances of her husband and mother on that subject went for nothing at all. END
BEGIN NOW Their being her relations too made it so much the worse; and Mrs. Jennings's attempts at consolation were therefore unfortunately founded, when she advised her daughter not to care about their being so fashionable; because they were all cousins and must put up with one another. END
BEGIN NOW As it was impossible, however, now to prevent their coming, Lady Middleton resigned herself to the idea of it, with all the philosophy of a well-bred woman, contenting herself with merely giving her husband a gentle reprimand on the subject five or six times every day. END
BEGIN NOW The young ladies arrived: their appearance was by no means ungenteel or unfashionable. END
BEGIN NOW Their dress was very smart, their manners very civil, they were delighted with the house, and in raptures with the furniture, and they happened to be so doatingly fond of children that Lady Middleton's good opinion was engaged in their favour before they had been an hour at the Park. END
BEGIN NOW She declared them to be very agreeable girls indeed, which for her ladyship was enthusiastic admiration. END
BEGIN NOW Sir John's confidence in his own judgment rose with this animated praise, and he set off directly for the cottage to tell the Miss Dashwoods of the Miss Steeles' arrival, and to assure them of their being the sweetest girls in the world. END
BEGIN NOW From such commendation as this, however, there was not much to be learned; Elinor well knew that the sweetest girls in the world were to be met with in every part of England, under every possible variation of form, face, temper and understanding. END
BEGIN NOW Sir John wanted the whole family to walk to the Park directly and look at his guests. END
BEGIN NOW Benevolent, philanthropic man! END
BEGIN NOW It was painful to him even to keep a third cousin to himself. END
BEGIN NOW Do come now, said he&mdash; pray come&mdash;you must come&mdash;I declare you shall come&mdash;You can't think how you will like them. END
BEGIN NOW Lucy is monstrous pretty, and so good humoured and agreeable! END
BEGIN NOW The children are all hanging about her already, as if she was an old acquaintance. END
BEGIN NOW And they both long to see you of all things, for they have heard at Exeter that you are the most beautiful creatures in the world; and I have told them it is all very true, and a great deal more. END
BEGIN NOW You will be delighted with them I am sure. END
BEGIN NOW They have brought the whole coach full of playthings for the children. END
BEGIN NOW How can you be so cross as not to come? END
BEGIN NOW Why they are your cousins, you know, after a fashion. END
BEGIN NOW YOU are my cousins, and they are my wife's, so you must be related. END
BEGIN NOW But Sir John could not prevail. END
BEGIN NOW He could only obtain a promise of their calling at the Park within a day or two, and then left them in amazement at their indifference, to walk home and boast anew of their attractions to the Miss Steeles, as he had been already boasting of the Miss Steeles to them. END
BEGIN NOW When their promised visit to the Park and consequent introduction to these young ladies took place, they found in the appearance of the eldest, who was nearly thirty, with a very plain and not a sensible face, nothing to admire; but in the other, who was not more than two or three and twenty, they acknowledged considerable beauty; her features were pretty, and she had a sharp quick eye, and a smartness of air, which though it did not give actual elegance or grace, gave distinction to her person.&mdash; Their manners were particularly civil, and Elinor soon allowed them credit for some kind of sense, when she saw with what constant and judicious attention they were making themselves agreeable to Lady Middleton. END
BEGIN NOW With her children they were in continual raptures, extolling their beauty, courting their notice, and humouring their whims; and such of their time as could be spared from the importunate demands which this politeness made on it, was spent in admiration of whatever her ladyship was doing, if she happened to be doing any thing, or in taking patterns of some elegant new dress, in which her appearance the day before had thrown them into unceasing delight. END
BEGIN NOW Fortunately for those who pay their court through such foibles, a fond mother, though, in pursuit of praise for her children, the most rapacious of human beings, is likewise the most credulous; her demands are exorbitant; but she will swallow any thing; and the excessive affection and endurance of the Miss Steeles towards her offspring were viewed therefore by Lady Middleton without the smallest surprise or distrust. END
BEGIN NOW She saw with maternal complacency all the impertinent encroachments and mischievous tricks to which her cousins submitted. END
BEGIN NOW She saw their sashes untied, their hair pulled about their ears, their work-bags searched, and their knives and scissors stolen away, and felt no doubt of its being a reciprocal enjoyment. END
BEGIN NOW It suggested no other surprise than that Elinor and Marianne should sit so composedly by, without claiming a share in what was passing. END
BEGIN NOW John is in such spirits today! END
BEGIN NOW said she, on his taking Miss Steeles's pocket handkerchief, and throwing it out of window&mdash; He is full of monkey tricks. END
BEGIN NOW And soon afterwards, on the second boy's violently pinching one of the same lady's fingers, she fondly observed, How playful William is! END
BEGIN NOW And here is my sweet little Annamaria, she added, tenderly caressing a little girl of three years old, who had not made a noise for the last two minutes; And she is always so gentle and quiet&mdash;Never was there such a quiet little thing! END
BEGIN NOW But unfortunately in bestowing these embraces, a pin in her ladyship's head dress slightly scratching the child's neck, produced from this pattern of gentleness such violent screams, as could hardly be outdone by any creature professedly noisy. END
BEGIN NOW The mother's consternation was excessive; but it could not surpass the alarm of the Miss Steeles, and every thing was done by all three, in so critical an emergency, which affection could suggest as likely to assuage the agonies of the little sufferer. END
BEGIN NOW She was seated in her mother's lap, covered with kisses, her wound bathed with lavender-water, by one of the Miss Steeles, who was on her knees to attend her, and her mouth stuffed with sugar plums by the other. END
BEGIN NOW With such a reward for her tears, the child was too wise to cease crying. END
BEGIN NOW She still screamed and sobbed lustily, kicked her two brothers for offering to touch her, and all their united soothings were ineffectual till Lady Middleton luckily remembering that in a scene of similar distress last week, some apricot marmalade had been successfully applied for a bruised temple, the same remedy was eagerly proposed for this unfortunate scratch, and a slight intermission of screams in the young lady on hearing it, gave them reason to hope that it would not be rejected.&mdash; She was carried out of the room therefore in her mother's arms, in quest of this medicine, and as the two boys chose to follow, though earnestly entreated by their mother to stay behind, the four young ladies were left in a quietness which the room had not known for many hours. END
BEGIN NOW Poor little creatures! END
BEGIN NOW said Miss Steele, as soon as they were gone. END
BEGIN NOW It might have been a very sad accident. END
BEGIN NOW Yet I hardly know how, cried Marianne, unless it had been under totally different circumstances. END
BEGIN NOW But this is the usual way of heightening alarm, where there is nothing to be alarmed at in reality. END
BEGIN NOW What a sweet woman Lady Middleton is! END
BEGIN NOW said Lucy Steele. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne was silent; it was impossible for her to say what she did not feel, however trivial the occasion; and upon Elinor therefore the whole task of telling lies when politeness required it, always fell. END
BEGIN NOW She did her best when thus called on, by speaking of Lady Middleton with more warmth than she felt, though with far less than Miss Lucy. END
BEGIN NOW And Sir John too, cried the elder sister, what a charming man he is! END
BEGIN NOW Here too, Miss Dashwood's commendation, being only simple and just, came in without any eclat. END
BEGIN NOW She merely observed that he was perfectly good humoured and friendly. END
BEGIN NOW And what a charming little family they have! END
BEGIN NOW I never saw such fine children in my life.&mdash;I declare I quite doat upon them already, and indeed I am always distractedly fond of children. END
BEGIN NOW I should guess so, said Elinor, with a smile, from what I have witnessed this morning. END
BEGIN NOW I have a notion, said Lucy, you think the little Middletons rather too much indulged; perhaps they may be the outside of enough; but it is so natural in Lady Middleton; and for my part, I love to see children full of life and spirits; I cannot bear them if they are tame and quiet. END
BEGIN NOW I confess, replied Elinor, that while I am at Barton Park, I never think of tame and quiet children with any abhorrence. END
BEGIN NOW A short pause succeeded this speech, which was first broken by Miss Steele, who seemed very much disposed for conversation, and who now said rather abruptly, And how do you like Devonshire, Miss Dashwood? END
BEGIN NOW I suppose you were very sorry to leave Sussex. END
BEGIN NOW In some surprise at the familiarity of this question, or at least of the manner in which it was spoken, Elinor replied that she was. END
BEGIN NOW Norland is a prodigious beautiful place, is not it? END
BEGIN NOW added Miss Steele. END
BEGIN NOW We have heard Sir John admire it excessively, said Lucy, who seemed to think some apology necessary for the freedom of her sister. END
BEGIN NOW I think every one MUST admire it, replied Elinor, who ever saw the place; though it is not to be supposed that any one can estimate its beauties as we do. END
BEGIN NOW And had you a great many smart beaux there? END
BEGIN NOW I suppose you have not so many in this part of the world; for my part, I think they are a vast addition always. END
BEGIN NOW But why should you think, said Lucy, looking ashamed of her sister, that there are not as many genteel young men in Devonshire as Sussex? END
BEGIN NOW Nay, my dear, I'm sure I don't pretend to say that there an't. END
BEGIN NOW I'm sure there's a vast many smart beaux in Exeter; but you know, how could I tell what smart beaux there might be about Norland; and I was only afraid the Miss Dashwoods might find it dull at Barton, if they had not so many as they used to have. END
BEGIN NOW But perhaps you young ladies may not care about the beaux, and had as lief be without them as with them. END
BEGIN NOW For my part, I think they are vastly agreeable, provided they dress smart and behave civil. END
BEGIN NOW But I can't bear to see them dirty and nasty. END
BEGIN NOW Now there's Mr. Rose at Exeter, a prodigious smart young man, quite a beau, clerk to Mr. Simpson, you know, and yet if you do but meet him of a morning, he is not fit to be seen.&mdash; I suppose your brother was quite a beau, Miss Dashwood, before he married, as he was so rich? END
BEGIN NOW Upon my word, replied Elinor, I cannot tell you, for I do not perfectly comprehend the meaning of the word. END
BEGIN NOW But this I can say, that if he ever was a beau before he married, he is one still for there is not the smallest alteration in him. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW dear! END
BEGIN NOW one never thinks of married men's being beaux&mdash;they have something else to do. END
BEGIN NOW Lord! END
BEGIN NOW Anne, cried her sister, you can talk of nothing but beaux;&mdash;you will make Miss Dashwood believe you think of nothing else. END
BEGIN NOW And then to turn the discourse, she began admiring the house and the furniture. END
BEGIN NOW This specimen of the Miss Steeles was enough. END
BEGIN NOW The vulgar freedom and folly of the eldest left her no recommendation, and as Elinor was not blinded by the beauty, or the shrewd look of the youngest, to her want of real elegance and artlessness, she left the house without any wish of knowing them better. END
BEGIN NOW Not so the Miss Steeles.&mdash;They came from Exeter, well provided with admiration for the use of Sir John Middleton, his family, and all his relations, and no niggardly proportion was now dealt out to his fair cousins, whom they declared to be the most beautiful, elegant, accomplished, and agreeable girls they had ever beheld, and with whom they were particularly anxious to be better acquainted.&mdash; And to be better acquainted therefore, Elinor soon found was their inevitable lot, for as Sir John was entirely on the side of the Miss Steeles, their party would be too strong for opposition, and that kind of intimacy must be submitted to, which consists of sitting an hour or two together in the same room almost every day. END
BEGIN NOW Sir John could do no more; but he did not know that any more was required: to be together was, in his opinion, to be intimate, and while his continual schemes for their meeting were effectual, he had not a doubt of their being established friends. END
BEGIN NOW To do him justice, he did every thing in his power to promote their unreserve, by making the Miss Steeles acquainted with whatever he knew or supposed of his cousins' situations in the most delicate particulars,&mdash;and Elinor had not seen them more than twice, before the eldest of them wished her joy on her sister's having been so lucky as to make a conquest of a very smart beau since she came to Barton. END
BEGIN NOW 'Twill be a fine thing to have her married so young to be sure, said she, and I hear he is quite a beau, and prodigious handsome. END
BEGIN NOW And I hope you may have as good luck yourself soon,&mdash;but perhaps you may have a friend in the corner already. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor could not suppose that Sir John would be more nice in proclaiming his suspicions of her regard for Edward, than he had been with respect to Marianne; indeed it was rather his favourite joke of the two, as being somewhat newer and more conjectural; and since Edward's visit, they had never dined together without his drinking to her best affections with so much significancy and so many nods and winks, as to excite general attention. END
BEGIN NOW The letter F&mdash;had been likewise invariably brought forward, and found productive of such countless jokes, that its character as the wittiest letter in the alphabet had been long established with Elinor. END
BEGIN NOW The Miss Steeles, as she expected, had now all the benefit of these jokes, and in the eldest of them they raised a curiosity to know the name of the gentleman alluded to, which, though often impertinently expressed, was perfectly of a piece with her general inquisitiveness into the concerns of their family. END
BEGIN NOW But Sir John did not sport long with the curiosity which he delighted to raise, for he had at least as much pleasure in telling the name, as Miss Steele had in hearing it. END
BEGIN NOW His name is Ferrars, said he, in a very audible whisper; but pray do not tell it, for it's a great secret. END
BEGIN NOW Ferrars! END
BEGIN NOW repeated Miss Steele; Mr. Ferrars is the happy man, is he? END
BEGIN NOW What! END
BEGIN NOW your sister-in-law's brother, Miss Dashwood? END
BEGIN NOW a very agreeable young man to be sure; I know him very well. END
BEGIN NOW How can you say so, Anne? END
BEGIN NOW cried Lucy, who generally made an amendment to all her sister's assertions. END
BEGIN NOW Though we have seen him once or twice at my uncle's, it is rather too much to pretend to know him very well. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor heard all this with attention and surprise. END
BEGIN NOW And who was this uncle? END
BEGIN NOW Where did he live? END
BEGIN NOW How came they acquainted? END
BEGIN NOW She wished very much to have the subject continued, though she did not chuse to join in it herself; but nothing more of it was said, and for the first time in her life, she thought Mrs. Jennings deficient either in curiosity after petty information, or in a disposition to communicate it. END
BEGIN NOW The manner in which Miss Steele had spoken of Edward, increased her curiosity; for it struck her as being rather ill-natured, and suggested the suspicion of that lady's knowing, or fancying herself to know something to his disadvantage.&mdash;But her curiosity was unavailing, for no farther notice was taken of Mr. Ferrars's name by Miss Steele when alluded to, or even openly mentioned by Sir John. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne, who had never much toleration for any thing like impertinence, vulgarity, inferiority of parts, or even difference of taste from herself, was at this time particularly ill-disposed, from the state of her spirits, to be pleased with the Miss Steeles, or to encourage their advances; and to the invariable coldness of her behaviour towards them, which checked every endeavour at intimacy on their side, Elinor principally attributed that preference of herself which soon became evident in the manners of both, but especially of Lucy, who missed no opportunity of engaging her in conversation, or of striving to improve their acquaintance by an easy and frank communication of her sentiments. END
BEGIN NOW Lucy was naturally clever; her remarks were often just and amusing; and as a companion for half an hour Elinor frequently found her agreeable; but her powers had received no aid from education: she was ignorant and illiterate; and her deficiency of all mental improvement, her want of information in the most common particulars, could not be concealed from Miss Dashwood, in spite of her constant endeavour to appear to advantage. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor saw, and pitied her for, the neglect of abilities which education might have rendered so respectable; but she saw, with less tenderness of feeling, the thorough want of delicacy, of rectitude, and integrity of mind, which her attentions, her assiduities, her flatteries at the Park betrayed; and she could have no lasting satisfaction in the company of a person who joined insincerity with ignorance; whose want of instruction prevented their meeting in conversation on terms of equality, and whose conduct toward others made every shew of attention and deference towards herself perfectly valueless. END
BEGIN NOW You will think my question an odd one, I dare say, said Lucy to her one day, as they were walking together from the park to the cottage&mdash; but pray, are you personally acquainted with your sister-in-law's mother, Mrs. Ferrars? END
BEGIN NOW Elinor DID think the question a very odd one, and her countenance expressed it, as she answered that she had never seen Mrs. Ferrars. END
BEGIN NOW Indeed! END
BEGIN NOW replied Lucy; I wonder at that, for I thought you must have seen her at Norland sometimes. END
BEGIN NOW Then, perhaps, you cannot tell me what sort of a woman she is? END
BEGIN NOW No, returned Elinor, cautious of giving her real opinion of Edward's mother, and not very desirous of satisfying what seemed impertinent curiosity&mdash; I know nothing of her. END
BEGIN NOW I am sure you think me very strange, for enquiring about her in such a way, said Lucy, eyeing Elinor attentively as she spoke; but perhaps there may be reasons&mdash;I wish I might venture; but however I hope you will do me the justice of believing that I do not mean to be impertinent. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor made her a civil reply, and they walked on for a few minutes in silence. END
BEGIN NOW It was broken by Lucy, who renewed the subject again by saying, with some hesitation, I cannot bear to have you think me impertinently curious. END
BEGIN NOW I am sure I would rather do any thing in the world than be thought so by a person whose good opinion is so well worth having as yours. END
BEGIN NOW And I am sure I should not have the smallest fear of trusting YOU; indeed, I should be very glad of your advice how to manage in such an uncomfortable situation as I am; but, however, there is no occasion to trouble YOU. END
BEGIN NOW I am sorry you do not happen to know Mrs. Ferrars. END
BEGIN NOW I am sorry I do NOT, said Elinor, in great astonishment, if it could be of any use to YOU to know my opinion of her. END
BEGIN NOW But really I never understood that you were at all connected with that family, and therefore I am a little surprised, I confess, at so serious an inquiry into her character. END
BEGIN NOW I dare say you are, and I am sure I do not at all wonder at it. END
BEGIN NOW But if I dared tell you all, you would not be so much surprised. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Ferrars is certainly nothing to me at present&mdash;but the time MAY come&mdash;how soon it will come must depend upon herself&mdash;when we may be very intimately connected. END
BEGIN NOW She looked down as she said this, amiably bashful, with only one side glance at her companion to observe its effect on her. END
BEGIN NOW Good heavens! END
BEGIN NOW cried Elinor, what do you mean? END
BEGIN NOW Are you acquainted with Mr. Robert Ferrars? END
BEGIN NOW Can you be? END
BEGIN NOW And she did not feel much delighted with the idea of such a sister-in-law. END
BEGIN NOW No, replied Lucy, not to Mr. ROBERT Ferrars&mdash;I never saw him in my life; but, fixing her eyes upon Elinor, to his eldest brother. END
BEGIN NOW What felt Elinor at that moment? END
BEGIN NOW Astonishment, that would have been as painful as it was strong, had not an immediate disbelief of the assertion attended it. END
BEGIN NOW She turned towards Lucy in silent amazement, unable to divine the reason or object of such a declaration; and though her complexion varied, she stood firm in incredulity, and felt in no danger of an hysterical fit, or a swoon. END
BEGIN NOW You may well be surprised, continued Lucy; for to be sure you could have had no idea of it before; for I dare say he never dropped the smallest hint of it to you or any of your family; because it was always meant to be a great secret, and I am sure has been faithfully kept so by me to this hour. END
BEGIN NOW Not a soul of all my relations know of it but Anne, and I never should have mentioned it to you, if I had not felt the greatest dependence in the world upon your secrecy; and I really thought my behaviour in asking so many questions about Mrs. Ferrars must seem so odd, that it ought to be explained. END
BEGIN NOW And I do not think Mr. Ferrars can be displeased, when he knows I have trusted you, because I know he has the highest opinion in the world of all your family, and looks upon yourself and the other Miss Dashwoods quite as his own sisters. END
BEGIN NOW &mdash;She paused. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor for a few moments remained silent. END
BEGIN NOW Her astonishment at what she heard was at first too great for words; but at length forcing herself to speak, and to speak cautiously, she said, with calmness of manner, which tolerably well concealed her surprise and solicitude&mdash; May I ask if your engagement is of long standing? END
BEGIN NOW We have been engaged these four years. END
BEGIN NOW Four years! END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor, though greatly shocked, still felt unable to believe it. END
BEGIN NOW I did not know, said she, that you were even acquainted till the other day. END
BEGIN NOW Our acquaintance, however, is of many years date. END
BEGIN NOW He was under my uncle's care, you know, a considerable while. END
BEGIN NOW Your uncle! END
BEGIN NOW Yes; Mr. Pratt. END
BEGIN NOW Did you never hear him talk of Mr. Pratt? END
BEGIN NOW I think I have, replied Elinor, with an exertion of spirits, which increased with her increase of emotion. END
BEGIN NOW He was four years with my uncle, who lives at Longstaple, near Plymouth. END
BEGIN NOW It was there our acquaintance begun, for my sister and me was often staying with my uncle, and it was there our engagement was formed, though not till a year after he had quitted as a pupil; but he was almost always with us afterwards. END
BEGIN NOW I was very unwilling to enter into it, as you may imagine, without the knowledge and approbation of his mother; but I was too young, and loved him too well, to be so prudent as I ought to have been.&mdash; Though you do not know him so well as me, Miss Dashwood, you must have seen enough of him to be sensible he is very capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him. END
BEGIN NOW Certainly, answered Elinor, without knowing what she said; but after a moment's reflection, she added, with revived security of Edward's honour and love, and her companion's falsehood&mdash; Engaged to Mr. Edward Ferrars!&mdash;I confess myself so totally surprised at what you tell me, that really&mdash;I beg your pardon; but surely there must be some mistake of person or name. END
BEGIN NOW We cannot mean the same Mr. Ferrars. END
BEGIN NOW We can mean no other, cried Lucy, smiling. END
BEGIN NOW Mr. Edward Ferrars, the eldest son of Mrs. Ferrars, of Park Street, and brother of your sister-in-law, Mrs. John Dashwood, is the person I mean; you must allow that I am not likely to be deceived as to the name of the man on who all my happiness depends. END
BEGIN NOW It is strange, replied Elinor, in a most painful perplexity, that I should never have heard him even mention your name. END
BEGIN NOW No; considering our situation, it was not strange. END
BEGIN NOW Our first care has been to keep the matter secret.&mdash; You knew nothing of me, or my family, and, therefore, there could be no OCCASION for ever mentioning my name to you; and, as he was always particularly afraid of his sister's suspecting any thing, THAT was reason enough for his not mentioning it. END
BEGIN NOW She was silent.&mdash;Elinor's security sunk; but her self-command did not sink with it. END
BEGIN NOW Four years you have been engaged, said she with a firm voice. END
BEGIN NOW Yes; and heaven knows how much longer we may have to wait. END
BEGIN NOW Poor Edward! END
BEGIN NOW It puts him quite out of heart. END
BEGIN NOW Then taking a small miniature from her pocket, she added, To prevent the possibility of mistake, be so good as to look at this face. END
BEGIN NOW It does not do him justice, to be sure, but yet I think you cannot be deceived as to the person it was drew for.&mdash;I have had it above these three years. END
BEGIN NOW She put it into her hands as she spoke; and when Elinor saw the painting, whatever other doubts her fear of a too hasty decision, or her wish of detecting falsehood might suffer to linger in her mind, she could have none of its being Edward's face. END
BEGIN NOW She returned it almost instantly, acknowledging the likeness. END
BEGIN NOW I have never been able, continued Lucy, to give him my picture in return, which I am very much vexed at, for he has been always so anxious to get it! END
BEGIN NOW But I am determined to set for it the very first opportunity. END
BEGIN NOW You are quite in the right, replied Elinor calmly. END
BEGIN NOW They then proceeded a few paces in silence. END
BEGIN NOW Lucy spoke first. END
BEGIN NOW I am sure, said she, I have no doubt in the world of your faithfully keeping this secret, because you must know of what importance it is to us, not to have it reach his mother; for she would never approve of it, I dare say. END
BEGIN NOW I shall have no fortune, and I fancy she is an exceeding proud woman. END
BEGIN NOW I certainly did not seek your confidence, said Elinor; but you do me no more than justice in imagining that I may be depended on. END
BEGIN NOW Your secret is safe with me; but pardon me if I express some surprise at so unnecessary a communication. END
BEGIN NOW You must at least have felt that my being acquainted with it could not add to its safety. END
BEGIN NOW As she said this, she looked earnestly at Lucy, hoping to discover something in her countenance; perhaps the falsehood of the greatest part of what she had been saying; but Lucy's countenance suffered no change. END
BEGIN NOW I was afraid you would think I was taking a great liberty with you, said she, in telling you all this. END
BEGIN NOW I have not known you long to be sure, personally at least, but I have known you and all your family by description a great while; and as soon as I saw you, I felt almost as if you was an old acquaintance. END
BEGIN NOW Besides in the present case, I really thought some explanation was due to you after my making such particular inquiries about Edward's mother; and I am so unfortunate, that I have not a creature whose advice I can ask. END
BEGIN NOW Anne is the only person that knows of it, and she has no judgment at all; indeed, she does me a great deal more harm than good, for I am in constant fear of her betraying me. END
BEGIN NOW She does not know how to hold her tongue, as you must perceive, and I am sure I was in the greatest fright in the world t'other day, when Edward's name was mentioned by Sir John, lest she should out with it all. END
BEGIN NOW You can't think how much I go through in my mind from it altogether. END
BEGIN NOW I only wonder that I am alive after what I have suffered for Edward's sake these last four years. END
BEGIN NOW Every thing in such suspense and uncertainty; and seeing him so seldom&mdash;we can hardly meet above twice a-year. END
BEGIN NOW I am sure I wonder my heart is not quite broke. END
BEGIN NOW Here she took out her handkerchief; but Elinor did not feel very compassionate. END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes. END
BEGIN NOW continued Lucy, after wiping her eyes, I think whether it would not be better for us both to break off the matter entirely. END
BEGIN NOW As she said this, she looked directly at her companion. END
BEGIN NOW But then at other times I have not resolution enough for it.&mdash; I cannot bear the thoughts of making him so miserable, as I know the very mention of such a thing would do. END
BEGIN NOW And on my own account too&mdash;so dear as he is to me&mdash;I don't think I could be equal to it. END
BEGIN NOW What would you advise me to do in such a case, Miss Dashwood? END
BEGIN NOW What would you do yourself? END
BEGIN NOW Pardon me, replied Elinor, startled by the question; but I can give you no advice under such circumstances. END
BEGIN NOW Your own judgment must direct you. END
BEGIN NOW To be sure, continued Lucy, after a few minutes silence on both sides, his mother must provide for him sometime or other; but poor Edward is so cast down by it! END
BEGIN NOW Did you not think him dreadful low-spirited when he was at Barton? END
BEGIN NOW He was so miserable when he left us at Longstaple, to go to you, that I was afraid you would think him quite ill. Did he come from your uncle's, then, when he visited us? END
BEGIN NOW Oh, yes; he had been staying a fortnight with us. END
BEGIN NOW Did you think he came directly from town? END
BEGIN NOW No, replied Elinor, most feelingly sensible of every fresh circumstance in favour of Lucy's veracity; I remember he told us, that he had been staying a fortnight with some friends near Plymouth. END
BEGIN NOW She remembered too, her own surprise at the time, at his mentioning nothing farther of those friends, at his total silence with respect even to their names. END
BEGIN NOW Did not you think him sadly out of spirits? END
BEGIN NOW repeated Lucy. END
BEGIN NOW We did, indeed, particularly so when he first arrived. END
BEGIN NOW I begged him to exert himself for fear you should suspect what was the matter; but it made him so melancholy, not being able to stay more than a fortnight with us, and seeing me so much affected.&mdash; Poor fellow!&mdash;I am afraid it is just the same with him now; for he writes in wretched spirits. END
BEGIN NOW I heard from him just before I left Exeter; taking a letter from her pocket and carelessly showing the direction to Elinor. END
BEGIN NOW You know his hand, I dare say, a charming one it is; but that is not written so well as usual.&mdash;He was tired, I dare say, for he had just filled the sheet to me as full as possible. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor saw that it WAS his hand, and she could doubt no longer. END
BEGIN NOW This picture, she had allowed herself to believe, might have been accidentally obtained; it might not have been Edward's gift; but a correspondence between them by letter, could subsist only under a positive engagement, could be authorised by nothing else; for a few moments, she was almost overcome&mdash;her heart sunk within her, and she could hardly stand; but exertion was indispensably necessary; and she struggled so resolutely against the oppression of her feelings, that her success was speedy, and for the time complete. END
BEGIN NOW Writing to each other, said Lucy, returning the letter into her pocket, is the only comfort we have in such long separations. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, I have one other comfort in his picture, but poor Edward has not even THAT. END
BEGIN NOW If he had but my picture, he says he should be easy. END
BEGIN NOW I gave him a lock of my hair set in a ring when he was at Longstaple last, and that was some comfort to him, he said, but not equal to a picture. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps you might notice the ring when you saw him? END
BEGIN NOW I did, said Elinor, with a composure of voice, under which was concealed an emotion and distress beyond any thing she had ever felt before. END
BEGIN NOW She was mortified, shocked, confounded. END
BEGIN NOW Fortunately for her, they had now reached the cottage, and the conversation could be continued no farther. END
BEGIN NOW After sitting with them a few minutes, the Miss Steeles returned to the Park, and Elinor was then at liberty to think and be wretched. END
BEGIN NOW However small Elinor's general dependence on Lucy's veracity might be, it was impossible for her on serious reflection to suspect it in the present case, where no temptation could be answerable to the folly of inventing a falsehood of such a description. END
BEGIN NOW What Lucy had asserted to be true, therefore, Elinor could not, dared not longer doubt; supported as it was too on every side by such probabilities and proofs, and contradicted by nothing but her own wishes. END
BEGIN NOW Their opportunity of acquaintance in the house of Mr. Pratt was a foundation for the rest, at once indisputable and alarming; and Edward's visit near Plymouth, his melancholy state of mind, his dissatisfaction at his own prospects, his uncertain behaviour towards herself, the intimate knowledge of the Miss Steeles as to Norland and their family connections, which had often surprised her, the picture, the letter, the ring, formed altogether such a body of evidence, as overcame every fear of condemning him unfairly, and established as a fact, which no partiality could set aside, his ill-treatment of herself.&mdash;Her resentment of such behaviour, her indignation at having been its dupe, for a short time made her feel only for herself; but other ideas, other considerations, soon arose. END
BEGIN NOW Had Edward been intentionally deceiving her? END
BEGIN NOW Had he feigned a regard for her which he did not feel? END
BEGIN NOW Was his engagement to Lucy an engagement of the heart? END
BEGIN NOW No; whatever it might once have been, she could not believe it such at present. END
BEGIN NOW His affection was all her own. END
BEGIN NOW She could not be deceived in that. END
BEGIN NOW Her mother, sisters, Fanny, all had been conscious of his regard for her at Norland; it was not an illusion of her own vanity. END
BEGIN NOW He certainly loved her. END
BEGIN NOW What a softener of the heart was this persuasion! END
BEGIN NOW How much could it not tempt her to forgive! END
BEGIN NOW He had been blamable, highly blamable, in remaining at Norland after he first felt her influence over him to be more than it ought to be. END
BEGIN NOW In that, he could not be defended; but if he had injured her, how much more had he injured himself; if her case were pitiable, his was hopeless. END
BEGIN NOW His imprudence had made her miserable for a while; but it seemed to have deprived himself of all chance of ever being otherwise. END
BEGIN NOW She might in time regain tranquillity; but HE, what had he to look forward to? END
BEGIN NOW Could he ever be tolerably happy with Lucy Steele; could he, were his affection for herself out of the question, with his integrity, his delicacy, and well-informed mind, be satisfied with a wife like her&mdash;illiterate, artful, and selfish? END
BEGIN NOW The youthful infatuation of nineteen would naturally blind him to every thing but her beauty and good nature; but the four succeeding years&mdash;years, which if rationally spent, give such improvement to the understanding, must have opened his eyes to her defects of education, while the same period of time, spent on her side in inferior society and more frivolous pursuits, had perhaps robbed her of that simplicity which might once have given an interesting character to her beauty. END
BEGIN NOW If in the supposition of his seeking to marry herself, his difficulties from his mother had seemed great, how much greater were they now likely to be, when the object of his engagement was undoubtedly inferior in connections, and probably inferior in fortune to herself. END
BEGIN NOW These difficulties, indeed, with a heart so alienated from Lucy, might not press very hard upon his patience; but melancholy was the state of the person by whom the expectation of family opposition and unkindness, could be felt as a relief! END
BEGIN NOW As these considerations occurred to her in painful succession, she wept for him, more than for herself. END
BEGIN NOW Supported by the conviction of having done nothing to merit her present unhappiness, and consoled by the belief that Edward had done nothing to forfeit her esteem, she thought she could even now, under the first smart of the heavy blow, command herself enough to guard every suspicion of the truth from her mother and sisters. END
BEGIN NOW And so well was she able to answer her own expectations, that when she joined them at dinner only two hours after she had first suffered the extinction of all her dearest hopes, no one would have supposed from the appearance of the sisters, that Elinor was mourning in secret over obstacles which must divide her for ever from the object of her love, and that Marianne was internally dwelling on the perfections of a man, of whose whole heart she felt thoroughly possessed, and whom she expected to see in every carriage which drove near their house. END
BEGIN NOW The necessity of concealing from her mother and Marianne, what had been entrusted in confidence to herself, though it obliged her to unceasing exertion, was no aggravation of Elinor's distress. END
BEGIN NOW On the contrary it was a relief to her, to be spared the communication of what would give such affliction to them, and to be saved likewise from hearing that condemnation of Edward, which would probably flow from the excess of their partial affection for herself, and which was more than she felt equal to support. END
BEGIN NOW From their counsel, or their conversation, she knew she could receive no assistance, their tenderness and sorrow must add to her distress, while her self-command would neither receive encouragement from their example nor from their praise. END
BEGIN NOW She was stronger alone, and her own good sense so well supported her, that her firmness was as unshaken, her appearance of cheerfulness as invariable, as with regrets so poignant and so fresh, it was possible for them to be. END
BEGIN NOW Much as she had suffered from her first conversation with Lucy on the subject, she soon felt an earnest wish of renewing it; and this for more reasons than one. END
BEGIN NOW She wanted to hear many particulars of their engagement repeated again, she wanted more clearly to understand what Lucy really felt for Edward, whether there were any sincerity in her declaration of tender regard for him, and she particularly wanted to convince Lucy, by her readiness to enter on the matter again, and her calmness in conversing on it, that she was no otherwise interested in it than as a friend, which she very much feared her involuntary agitation, in their morning discourse, must have left at least doubtful. END
BEGIN NOW That Lucy was disposed to be jealous of her appeared very probable: it was plain that Edward had always spoken highly in her praise, not merely from Lucy's assertion, but from her venturing to trust her on so short a personal acquaintance, with a secret so confessedly and evidently important. END
BEGIN NOW And even Sir John's joking intelligence must have had some weight. END
BEGIN NOW But indeed, while Elinor remained so well assured within herself of being really beloved by Edward, it required no other consideration of probabilities to make it natural that Lucy should be jealous; and that she was so, her very confidence was a proof. END
BEGIN NOW What other reason for the disclosure of the affair could there be, but that Elinor might be informed by it of Lucy's superior claims on Edward, and be taught to avoid him in future? END
BEGIN NOW She had little difficulty in understanding thus much of her rival's intentions, and while she was firmly resolved to act by her as every principle of honour and honesty directed, to combat her own affection for Edward and to see him as little as possible; she could not deny herself the comfort of endeavouring to convince Lucy that her heart was unwounded. END
BEGIN NOW And as she could now have nothing more painful to hear on the subject than had already been told, she did not mistrust her own ability of going through a repetition of particulars with composure. END
BEGIN NOW But it was not immediately that an opportunity of doing so could be commanded, though Lucy was as well disposed as herself to take advantage of any that occurred; for the weather was not often fine enough to allow of their joining in a walk, where they might most easily separate themselves from the others; and though they met at least every other evening either at the park or cottage, and chiefly at the former, they could not be supposed to meet for the sake of conversation. END
BEGIN NOW Such a thought would never enter either Sir John or Lady Middleton's head; and therefore very little leisure was ever given for a general chat, and none at all for particular discourse. END
BEGIN NOW They met for the sake of eating, drinking, and laughing together, playing at cards, or consequences, or any other game that was sufficiently noisy. END
BEGIN NOW One or two meetings of this kind had taken place, without affording Elinor any chance of engaging Lucy in private, when Sir John called at the cottage one morning, to beg, in the name of charity, that they would all dine with Lady Middleton that day, as he was obliged to attend the club at Exeter, and she would otherwise be quite alone, except her mother and the two Miss Steeles. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor, who foresaw a fairer opening for the point she had in view, in such a party as this was likely to be, more at liberty among themselves under the tranquil and well-bred direction of Lady Middleton than when her husband united them together in one noisy purpose, immediately accepted the invitation; Margaret, with her mother's permission, was equally compliant, and Marianne, though always unwilling to join any of their parties, was persuaded by her mother, who could not bear to have her seclude herself from any chance of amusement, to go likewise. END
BEGIN NOW The young ladies went, and Lady Middleton was happily preserved from the frightful solitude which had threatened her. END
BEGIN NOW The insipidity of the meeting was exactly such as Elinor had expected; it produced not one novelty of thought or expression, and nothing could be less interesting than the whole of their discourse both in the dining parlour and drawing room: to the latter, the children accompanied them, and while they remained there, she was too well convinced of the impossibility of engaging Lucy's attention to attempt it. END
BEGIN NOW They quitted it only with the removal of the tea-things. END
BEGIN NOW The card-table was then placed, and Elinor began to wonder at herself for having ever entertained a hope of finding time for conversation at the park. END
BEGIN NOW They all rose up in preparation for a round game. END
BEGIN NOW I am glad, said Lady Middleton to Lucy, you are not going to finish poor little Annamaria's basket this evening; for I am sure it must hurt your eyes to work filigree by candlelight. END
BEGIN NOW And we will make the dear little love some amends for her disappointment to-morrow, and then I hope she will not much mind it. END
BEGIN NOW This hint was enough, Lucy recollected herself instantly and replied, Indeed you are very much mistaken, Lady Middleton; I am only waiting to know whether you can make your party without me, or I should have been at my filigree already. END
BEGIN NOW I would not disappoint the little angel for all the world: and if you want me at the card-table now, I am resolved to finish the basket after supper. END
BEGIN NOW You are very good, I hope it won't hurt your eyes&mdash;will you ring the bell for some working candles? END
BEGIN NOW My poor little girl would be sadly disappointed, I know, if the basket was not finished tomorrow, for though I told her it certainly would not, I am sure she depends upon having it done. END
BEGIN NOW Lucy directly drew her work table near her and reseated herself with an alacrity and cheerfulness which seemed to infer that she could taste no greater delight than in making a filigree basket for a spoilt child. END
BEGIN NOW Lady Middleton proposed a rubber of Casino to the others. END
BEGIN NOW No one made any objection but Marianne, who with her usual inattention to the forms of general civility, exclaimed, Your Ladyship will have the goodness to excuse ME&mdash;you know I detest cards. END
BEGIN NOW I shall go to the piano-forte; I have not touched it since it was tuned. END
BEGIN NOW And without farther ceremony, she turned away and walked to the instrument. END
BEGIN NOW Lady Middleton looked as if she thanked heaven that SHE had never made so rude a speech. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne can never keep long from that instrument you know, ma'am, said Elinor, endeavouring to smooth away the offence; and I do not much wonder at it; for it is the very best toned piano-forte I ever heard. END
BEGIN NOW The remaining five were now to draw their cards. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps, continued Elinor, if I should happen to cut out, I may be of some use to Miss Lucy Steele, in rolling her papers for her; and there is so much still to be done to the basket, that it must be impossible I think for her labour singly, to finish it this evening. END
BEGIN NOW I should like the work exceedingly, if she would allow me a share in it. END
BEGIN NOW Indeed I shall be very much obliged to you for your help, cried Lucy, for I find there is more to be done to it than I thought there was; and it would be a shocking thing to disappoint dear Annamaria after all. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW that would be terrible, indeed, said Miss Steele&mdash; Dear little soul, how I do love her! END
BEGIN NOW You are very kind, said Lady Middleton to Elinor; and as you really like the work, perhaps you will be as well pleased not to cut in till another rubber, or will you take your chance now? END
BEGIN NOW Elinor joyfully profited by the first of these proposals, and thus by a little of that address which Marianne could never condescend to practise, gained her own end, and pleased Lady Middleton at the same time. END
BEGIN NOW Lucy made room for her with ready attention, and the two fair rivals were thus seated side by side at the same table, and, with the utmost harmony, engaged in forwarding the same work. END
BEGIN NOW The pianoforte at which Marianne, wrapped up in her own music and her own thoughts, had by this time forgotten that any body was in the room besides herself, was luckily so near them that Miss Dashwood now judged she might safely, under the shelter of its noise, introduce the interesting subject, without any risk of being heard at the card-table. END
BEGIN NOW In a firm, though cautious tone, Elinor thus began. END
BEGIN NOW I should be undeserving of the confidence you have honoured me with, if I felt no desire for its continuance, or no farther curiosity on its subject. END
BEGIN NOW I will not apologize therefore for bringing it forward again. END
BEGIN NOW Thank you, cried Lucy warmly, for breaking the ice; you have set my heart at ease by it; for I was somehow or other afraid I had offended you by what I told you that Monday. END
BEGIN NOW Offended me! END
BEGIN NOW How could you suppose so? END
BEGIN NOW Believe me, and Elinor spoke it with the truest sincerity, nothing could be farther from my intention than to give you such an idea. END
BEGIN NOW Could you have a motive for the trust, that was not honourable and flattering to me? END
BEGIN NOW And yet I do assure you, replied Lucy, her little sharp eyes full of meaning, there seemed to me to be a coldness and displeasure in your manner that made me quite uncomfortable. END
BEGIN NOW I felt sure that you was angry with me; and have been quarrelling with myself ever since, for having took such a liberty as to trouble you with my affairs. END
BEGIN NOW But I am very glad to find it was only my own fancy, and that you really do not blame me. END
BEGIN NOW If you knew what a consolation it was to me to relieve my heart speaking to you of what I am always thinking of every moment of my life, your compassion would make you overlook every thing else I am sure. END
BEGIN NOW Indeed, I can easily believe that it was a very great relief to you, to acknowledge your situation to me, and be assured that you shall never have reason to repent it. END
BEGIN NOW Your case is a very unfortunate one; you seem to me to be surrounded with difficulties, and you will have need of all your mutual affection to support you under them. END
BEGIN NOW Mr. Ferrars, I believe, is entirely dependent on his mother. END
BEGIN NOW He has only two thousand pounds of his own; it would be madness to marry upon that, though for my own part, I could give up every prospect of more without a sigh. END
BEGIN NOW I have been always used to a very small income, and could struggle with any poverty for him; but I love him too well to be the selfish means of robbing him, perhaps, of all that his mother might give him if he married to please her. END
BEGIN NOW We must wait, it may be for many years. END
BEGIN NOW With almost every other man in the world, it would be an alarming prospect; but Edward's affection and constancy nothing can deprive me of I know. END
BEGIN NOW That conviction must be every thing to you; and he is undoubtedly supported by the same trust in your's. END
BEGIN NOW If the strength of your reciprocal attachment had failed, as between many people, and under many circumstances it naturally would during a four years' engagement, your situation would have been pitiable, indeed. END
BEGIN NOW Lucy here looked up; but Elinor was careful in guarding her countenance from every expression that could give her words a suspicious tendency. END
BEGIN NOW Edward's love for me, said Lucy, has been pretty well put to the test, by our long, very long absence since we were first engaged, and it has stood the trial so well, that I should be unpardonable to doubt it now. END
BEGIN NOW I can safely say that he has never gave me one moment's alarm on that account from the first. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor hardly knew whether to smile or sigh at this assertion. END
BEGIN NOW Lucy went on. END
BEGIN NOW I am rather of a jealous temper too by nature, and from our different situations in life, from his being so much more in the world than me, and our continual separation, I was enough inclined for suspicion, to have found out the truth in an instant, if there had been the slightest alteration in his behaviour to me when we met, or any lowness of spirits that I could not account for, or if he had talked more of one lady than another, or seemed in any respect less happy at Longstaple than he used to be. END
BEGIN NOW I do not mean to say that I am particularly observant or quick-sighted in general, but in such a case I am sure I could not be deceived. END
BEGIN NOW All this, thought Elinor, is very pretty; but it can impose upon neither of us. END
BEGIN NOW But what, said she after a short silence, are your views? END
BEGIN NOW or have you none but that of waiting for Mrs. Ferrars's death, which is a melancholy and shocking extremity?&mdash;Is her son determined to submit to this, and to all the tediousness of the many years of suspense in which it may involve you, rather than run the risk of her displeasure for a while by owning the truth? END
BEGIN NOW If we could be certain that it would be only for a while! END
BEGIN NOW But Mrs. Ferrars is a very headstrong proud woman, and in her first fit of anger upon hearing it, would very likely secure every thing to Robert, and the idea of that, for Edward's sake, frightens away all my inclination for hasty measures. END
BEGIN NOW And for your own sake too, or you are carrying your disinterestedness beyond reason. END
BEGIN NOW Lucy looked at Elinor again, and was silent. END
BEGIN NOW Do you know Mr. Robert Ferrars? END
BEGIN NOW asked Elinor. END
BEGIN NOW Not at all&mdash;I never saw him; but I fancy he is very unlike his brother&mdash;silly and a great coxcomb. END
BEGIN NOW A great coxcomb! END
BEGIN NOW repeated Miss Steele, whose ear had caught those words by a sudden pause in Marianne's music.&mdash; Oh, they are talking of their favourite beaux, I dare say. END
BEGIN NOW No sister, cried Lucy, you are mistaken there, our favourite beaux are NOT great coxcombs. END
BEGIN NOW I can answer for it that Miss Dashwood's is not, said Mrs. Jennings, laughing heartily; for he is one of the modestest, prettiest behaved young men I ever saw; but as for Lucy, she is such a sly little creature, there is no finding out who SHE likes. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, cried Miss Steele, looking significantly round at them, I dare say Lucy's beau is quite as modest and pretty behaved as Miss Dashwood's. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor blushed in spite of herself. END
BEGIN NOW Lucy bit her lip, and looked angrily at her sister. END
BEGIN NOW A mutual silence took place for some time. END
BEGIN NOW Lucy first put an end to it by saying in a lower tone, though Marianne was then giving them the powerful protection of a very magnificent concerto&mdash; I will honestly tell you of one scheme which has lately come into my head, for bringing matters to bear; indeed I am bound to let you into the secret, for you are a party concerned. END
BEGIN NOW I dare say you have seen enough of Edward to know that he would prefer the church to every other profession; now my plan is that he should take orders as soon as he can, and then through your interest, which I am sure you would be kind enough to use out of friendship for him, and I hope out of some regard to me, your brother might be persuaded to give him Norland living; which I understand is a very good one, and the present incumbent not likely to live a great while. END
BEGIN NOW That would be enough for us to marry upon, and we might trust to time and chance for the rest. END
BEGIN NOW I should always be happy, replied Elinor, to show any mark of my esteem and friendship for Mr. Ferrars; but do you not perceive that my interest on such an occasion would be perfectly unnecessary? END
BEGIN NOW He is brother to Mrs. John Dashwood&mdash;THAT must be recommendation enough to her husband. END
BEGIN NOW But Mrs. John Dashwood would not much approve of Edward's going into orders. END
BEGIN NOW Then I rather suspect that my interest would do very little. END
BEGIN NOW They were again silent for many minutes. END
BEGIN NOW At length Lucy exclaimed with a deep sigh, I believe it would be the wisest way to put an end to the business at once by dissolving the engagement. END
BEGIN NOW We seem so beset with difficulties on every side, that though it would make us miserable for a time, we should be happier perhaps in the end. END
BEGIN NOW But you will not give me your advice, Miss Dashwood? END
BEGIN NOW No, answered Elinor, with a smile, which concealed very agitated feelings, on such a subject I certainly will not. END
BEGIN NOW You know very well that my opinion would have no weight with you, unless it were on the side of your wishes. END
BEGIN NOW Indeed you wrong me, replied Lucy, with great solemnity; I know nobody of whose judgment I think so highly as I do of yours; and I do really believe, that if you was to say to me, 'I advise you by all means to put an end to your engagement with Edward Ferrars, it will be more for the happiness of both of you,' I should resolve upon doing it immediately. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor blushed for the insincerity of Edward's future wife, and replied, This compliment would effectually frighten me from giving any opinion on the subject had I formed one. END
BEGIN NOW It raises my influence much too high; the power of dividing two people so tenderly attached is too much for an indifferent person. END
BEGIN NOW 'Tis because you are an indifferent person, said Lucy, with some pique, and laying a particular stress on those words, that your judgment might justly have such weight with me. END
BEGIN NOW If you could be supposed to be biased in any respect by your own feelings, your opinion would not be worth having. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor thought it wisest to make no answer to this, lest they might provoke each other to an unsuitable increase of ease and unreserve; and was even partly determined never to mention the subject again. END
BEGIN NOW Another pause therefore of many minutes' duration, succeeded this speech, and Lucy was still the first to end it. END
BEGIN NOW Shall you be in town this winter, Miss Dashwood? END
BEGIN NOW said she with all her accustomary complacency. END
BEGIN NOW Certainly not. END
BEGIN NOW I am sorry for that, returned the other, while her eyes brightened at the information, it would have gave me such pleasure to meet you there! END
BEGIN NOW But I dare say you will go for all that. END
BEGIN NOW To be sure, your brother and sister will ask you to come to them. END
BEGIN NOW It will not be in my power to accept their invitation if they do. END
BEGIN NOW How unlucky that is! END
BEGIN NOW I had quite depended upon meeting you there. END
BEGIN NOW Anne and me are to go the latter end of January to some relations who have been wanting us to visit them these several years! END
BEGIN NOW But I only go for the sake of seeing Edward. END
BEGIN NOW He will be there in February, otherwise London would have no charms for me; I have not spirits for it. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor was soon called to the card-table by the conclusion of the first rubber, and the confidential discourse of the two ladies was therefore at an end, to which both of them submitted without any reluctance, for nothing had been said on either side to make them dislike each other less than they had done before; and Elinor sat down to the card table with the melancholy persuasion that Edward was not only without affection for the person who was to be his wife; but that he had not even the chance of being tolerably happy in marriage, which sincere affection on HER side would have given, for self-interest alone could induce a woman to keep a man to an engagement, of which she seemed so thoroughly aware that he was weary. END
BEGIN NOW From this time the subject was never revived by Elinor, and when entered on by Lucy, who seldom missed an opportunity of introducing it, and was particularly careful to inform her confidante, of her happiness whenever she received a letter from Edward, it was treated by the former with calmness and caution, and dismissed as soon as civility would allow; for she felt such conversations to be an indulgence which Lucy did not deserve, and which were dangerous to herself. END
BEGIN NOW The visit of the Miss Steeles at Barton Park was lengthened far beyond what the first invitation implied. END
BEGIN NOW Their favour increased; they could not be spared; Sir John would not hear of their going; and in spite of their numerous and long arranged engagements in Exeter, in spite of the absolute necessity of returning to fulfill them immediately, which was in full force at the end of every week, they were prevailed on to stay nearly two months at the park, and to assist in the due celebration of that festival which requires a more than ordinary share of private balls and large dinners to proclaim its importance. END
BEGIN NOW Though Mrs. Jennings was in the habit of spending a large portion of the year at the houses of her children and friends, she was not without a settled habitation of her own. END
BEGIN NOW Since the death of her husband, who had traded with success in a less elegant part of the town, she had resided every winter in a house in one of the streets near Portman Square. END
BEGIN NOW Towards this home, she began on the approach of January to turn her thoughts, and thither she one day abruptly, and very unexpectedly by them, asked the elder Misses Dashwood to accompany her. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor, without observing the varying complexion of her sister, and the animated look which spoke no indifference to the plan, immediately gave a grateful but absolute denial for both, in which she believed herself to be speaking their united inclinations. END
BEGIN NOW The reason alleged was their determined resolution of not leaving their mother at that time of the year. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Jennings received the refusal with some surprise, and repeated her invitation immediately. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, Lord! END
BEGIN NOW I am sure your mother can spare you very well, and I DO beg you will favour me with your company, for I've quite set my heart upon it. END
BEGIN NOW Don't fancy that you will be any inconvenience to me, for I shan't put myself at all out of my way for you. END
BEGIN NOW It will only be sending Betty by the coach, and I hope I can afford THAT. END
BEGIN NOW We three shall be able to go very well in my chaise; and when we are in town, if you do not like to go wherever I do, well and good, you may always go with one of my daughters. END
BEGIN NOW I am sure your mother will not object to it; for I have had such good luck in getting my own children off my hands that she will think me a very fit person to have the charge of you; and if I don't get one of you at least well married before I have done with you, it shall not be my fault. END
BEGIN NOW I shall speak a good word for you to all the young men, you may depend upon it. END
BEGIN NOW I have a notion, said Sir John, that Miss Marianne would not object to such a scheme, if her elder sister would come into it. END
BEGIN NOW It is very hard indeed that she should not have a little pleasure, because Miss Dashwood does not wish it. END
BEGIN NOW So I would advise you two, to set off for town, when you are tired of Barton, without saying a word to Miss Dashwood about it. END
BEGIN NOW Nay, cried Mrs. Jennings, I am sure I shall be monstrous glad of Miss Marianne's company, whether Miss Dashwood will go or not, only the more the merrier say I, and I thought it would be more comfortable for them to be together; because, if they got tired of me, they might talk to one another, and laugh at my old ways behind my back. END
BEGIN NOW But one or the other, if not both of them, I must have. END
BEGIN NOW Lord bless me! END
BEGIN NOW how do you think I can live poking by myself, I who have been always used till this winter to have Charlotte with me. END
BEGIN NOW Come, Miss Marianne, let us strike hands upon the bargain, and if Miss Dashwood will change her mind by and bye, why so much the better. END
BEGIN NOW I thank you, ma'am, sincerely thank you, said Marianne, with warmth: your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever, and it would give me such happiness, yes, almost the greatest happiness I am capable of, to be able to accept it. END
BEGIN NOW But my mother, my dearest, kindest mother,&mdash;I feel the justice of what Elinor has urged, and if she were to be made less happy, less comfortable by our absence&mdash;Oh! END
BEGIN NOW no, nothing should tempt me to leave her. END
BEGIN NOW It should not, must not be a struggle. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Jennings repeated her assurance that Mrs. Dashwood could spare them perfectly well; and Elinor, who now understood her sister, and saw to what indifference to almost every thing else she was carried by her eagerness to be with Willoughby again, made no farther direct opposition to the plan, and merely referred it to her mother's decision, from whom however she scarcely expected to receive any support in her endeavour to prevent a visit, which she could not approve of for Marianne, and which on her own account she had particular reasons to avoid. END
BEGIN NOW Whatever Marianne was desirous of, her mother would be eager to promote&mdash;she could not expect to influence the latter to cautiousness of conduct in an affair respecting which she had never been able to inspire her with distrust; and she dared not explain the motive of her own disinclination for going to London. END
BEGIN NOW That Marianne, fastidious as she was, thoroughly acquainted with Mrs. Jennings' manners, and invariably disgusted by them, should overlook every inconvenience of that kind, should disregard whatever must be most wounding to her irritable feelings, in her pursuit of one object, was such a proof, so strong, so full, of the importance of that object to her, as Elinor, in spite of all that had passed, was not prepared to witness. END
BEGIN NOW On being informed of the invitation, Mrs. Dashwood, persuaded that such an excursion would be productive of much amusement to both her daughters, and perceiving through all her affectionate attention to herself, how much the heart of Marianne was in it, would not hear of their declining the offer upon HER account; insisted on their both accepting it directly; and then began to foresee, with her usual cheerfulness, a variety of advantages that would accrue to them all, from this separation. END
BEGIN NOW I am delighted with the plan, she cried, it is exactly what I could wish. END
BEGIN NOW Margaret and I shall be as much benefited by it as yourselves. END
BEGIN NOW When you and the Middletons are gone, we shall go on so quietly and happily together with our books and our music! END
BEGIN NOW You will find Margaret so improved when you come back again! END
BEGIN NOW I have a little plan of alteration for your bedrooms too, which may now be performed without any inconvenience to any one. END
BEGIN NOW It is very right that you SHOULD go to town; I would have every young woman of your condition in life acquainted with the manners and amusements of London. END
BEGIN NOW You will be under the care of a motherly good sort of woman, of whose kindness to you I can have no doubt. END
BEGIN NOW And in all probability you will see your brother, and whatever may be his faults, or the faults of his wife, when I consider whose son he is, I cannot bear to have you so wholly estranged from each other. END
BEGIN NOW Though with your usual anxiety for our happiness, said Elinor, you have been obviating every impediment to the present scheme which occurred to you, there is still one objection which, in my opinion, cannot be so easily removed. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne's countenance sunk. END
BEGIN NOW And what, said Mrs. Dashwood, is my dear prudent Elinor going to suggest? END
BEGIN NOW What formidable obstacle is she now to bring forward? END
BEGIN NOW Do let me hear a word about the expense of it. END
BEGIN NOW My objection is this; though I think very well of Mrs. Jennings's heart, she is not a woman whose society can afford us pleasure, or whose protection will give us consequence. END
BEGIN NOW That is very true, replied her mother, but of her society, separately from that of other people, you will scarcely have any thing at all, and you will almost always appear in public with Lady Middleton. END
BEGIN NOW If Elinor is frightened away by her dislike of Mrs. Jennings, said Marianne, at least it need not prevent MY accepting her invitation. END
BEGIN NOW I have no such scruples, and I am sure I could put up with every unpleasantness of that kind with very little effort. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor could not help smiling at this display of indifference towards the manners of a person, to whom she had often had difficulty in persuading Marianne to behave with tolerable politeness; and resolved within herself, that if her sister persisted in going, she would go likewise, as she did not think it proper that Marianne should be left to the sole guidance of her own judgment, or that Mrs. Jennings should be abandoned to the mercy of Marianne for all the comfort of her domestic hours. END
BEGIN NOW To this determination she was the more easily reconciled, by recollecting that Edward Ferrars, by Lucy's account, was not to be in town before February; and that their visit, without any unreasonable abridgement, might be previously finished. END
BEGIN NOW I will have you BOTH go, said Mrs. Dashwood; these objections are nonsensical. END
BEGIN NOW You will have much pleasure in being in London, and especially in being together; and if Elinor would ever condescend to anticipate enjoyment, she would foresee it there from a variety of sources; she would, perhaps, expect some from improving her acquaintance with her sister-in-law's family. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor had often wished for an opportunity of attempting to weaken her mother's dependence on the attachment of Edward and herself, that the shock might be less when the whole truth were revealed, and now on this attack, though almost hopeless of success, she forced herself to begin her design by saying, as calmly as she could, I like Edward Ferrars very much, and shall always be glad to see him; but as to the rest of the family, it is a matter of perfect indifference to me, whether I am ever known to them or not. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Dashwood smiled, and said nothing. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne lifted up her eyes in astonishment, and Elinor conjectured that she might as well have held her tongue. END
BEGIN NOW After very little farther discourse, it was finally settled that the invitation should be fully accepted. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Jennings received the information with a great deal of joy, and many assurances of kindness and care; nor was it a matter of pleasure merely to her. END
BEGIN NOW Sir John was delighted; for to a man, whose prevailing anxiety was the dread of being alone, the acquisition of two, to the number of inhabitants in London, was something. END
BEGIN NOW Even Lady Middleton took the trouble of being delighted, which was putting herself rather out of her way; and as for the Miss Steeles, especially Lucy, they had never been so happy in their lives as this intelligence made them. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor submitted to the arrangement which counteracted her wishes with less reluctance than she had expected to feel. END
BEGIN NOW With regard to herself, it was now a matter of unconcern whether she went to town or not, and when she saw her mother so thoroughly pleased with the plan, and her sister exhilarated by it in look, voice, and manner, restored to all her usual animation, and elevated to more than her usual gaiety, she could not be dissatisfied with the cause, and would hardly allow herself to distrust the consequence. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne's joy was almost a degree beyond happiness, so great was the perturbation of her spirits and her impatience to be gone. END
BEGIN NOW Her unwillingness to quit her mother was her only restorative to calmness; and at the moment of parting her grief on that score was excessive. END
BEGIN NOW Her mother's affliction was hardly less, and Elinor was the only one of the three, who seemed to consider the separation as any thing short of eternal. END
BEGIN NOW Their departure took place in the first week in January. END
BEGIN NOW The Middletons were to follow in about a week. END
BEGIN NOW The Miss Steeles kept their station at the park, and were to quit it only with the rest of the family. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor could not find herself in the carriage with Mrs. Jennings, and beginning a journey to London under her protection, and as her guest, without wondering at her own situation, so short had their acquaintance with that lady been, so wholly unsuited were they in age and disposition, and so many had been her objections against such a measure only a few days before! END
BEGIN NOW But these objections had all, with that happy ardour of youth which Marianne and her mother equally shared, been overcome or overlooked; and Elinor, in spite of every occasional doubt of Willoughby's constancy, could not witness the rapture of delightful expectation which filled the whole soul and beamed in the eyes of Marianne, without feeling how blank was her own prospect, how cheerless her own state of mind in the comparison, and how gladly she would engage in the solicitude of Marianne's situation to have the same animating object in view, the same possibility of hope. END
BEGIN NOW A short, a very short time however must now decide what Willoughby's intentions were; in all probability he was already in town. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne's eagerness to be gone declared her dependence on finding him there; and Elinor was resolved not only upon gaining every new light as to his character which her own observation or the intelligence of others could give her, but likewise upon watching his behaviour to her sister with such zealous attention, as to ascertain what he was and what he meant, before many meetings had taken place. END
BEGIN NOW Should the result of her observations be unfavourable, she was determined at all events to open the eyes of her sister; should it be otherwise, her exertions would be of a different nature&mdash;she must then learn to avoid every selfish comparison, and banish every regret which might lessen her satisfaction in the happiness of Marianne. END
BEGIN NOW They were three days on their journey, and Marianne's behaviour as they travelled was a happy specimen of what future complaisance and companionableness to Mrs. Jennings might be expected to be. END
BEGIN NOW She sat in silence almost all the way, wrapt in her own meditations, and scarcely ever voluntarily speaking, except when any object of picturesque beauty within their view drew from her an exclamation of delight exclusively addressed to her sister. END
BEGIN NOW To atone for this conduct therefore, Elinor took immediate possession of the post of civility which she had assigned herself, behaved with the greatest attention to Mrs. Jennings, talked with her, laughed with her, and listened to her whenever she could; and Mrs. Jennings on her side treated them both with all possible kindness, was solicitous on every occasion for their ease and enjoyment, and only disturbed that she could not make them choose their own dinners at the inn, nor extort a confession of their preferring salmon to cod, or boiled fowls to veal cutlets. END
BEGIN NOW They reached town by three o'clock the third day, glad to be released, after such a journey, from the confinement of a carriage, and ready to enjoy all the luxury of a good fire. END
BEGIN NOW The house was handsome, and handsomely fitted up, and the young ladies were immediately put in possession of a very comfortable apartment. END
BEGIN NOW It had formerly been Charlotte's, and over the mantelpiece still hung a landscape in coloured silks of her performance, in proof of her having spent seven years at a great school in town to some effect. END
BEGIN NOW As dinner was not to be ready in less than two hours from their arrival, Elinor determined to employ the interval in writing to her mother, and sat down for that purpose. END
BEGIN NOW In a few moments Marianne did the same. END
BEGIN NOW I am writing home, Marianne, said Elinor; had not you better defer your letter for a day or two? END
BEGIN NOW I am NOT going to write to my mother, replied Marianne, hastily, and as if wishing to avoid any farther inquiry. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor said no more; it immediately struck her that she must then be writing to Willoughby; and the conclusion which as instantly followed was, that, however mysteriously they might wish to conduct the affair, they must be engaged. END
BEGIN NOW This conviction, though not entirely satisfactory, gave her pleasure, and she continued her letter with greater alacrity. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne's was finished in a very few minutes; in length it could be no more than a note; it was then folded up, sealed, and directed with eager rapidity. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor thought she could distinguish a large W in the direction; and no sooner was it complete than Marianne, ringing the bell, requested the footman who answered it to get that letter conveyed for her to the two-penny post. END
BEGIN NOW This decided the matter at once. END
BEGIN NOW Her spirits still continued very high; but there was a flutter in them which prevented their giving much pleasure to her sister, and this agitation increased as the evening drew on. END
BEGIN NOW She could scarcely eat any dinner, and when they afterwards returned to the drawing room, seemed anxiously listening to the sound of every carriage. END
BEGIN NOW It was a great satisfaction to Elinor that Mrs. Jennings, by being much engaged in her own room, could see little of what was passing. END
BEGIN NOW The tea things were brought in, and already had Marianne been disappointed more than once by a rap at a neighbouring door, when a loud one was suddenly heard which could not be mistaken for one at any other house, Elinor felt secure of its announcing Willoughby's approach, and Marianne, starting up, moved towards the door. END
BEGIN NOW Every thing was silent; this could not be borne many seconds; she opened the door, advanced a few steps towards the stairs, and after listening half a minute, returned into the room in all the agitation which a conviction of having heard him would naturally produce; in the ecstasy of her feelings at that instant she could not help exclaiming, Oh, Elinor, it is Willoughby, indeed it is! END
BEGIN NOW and seemed almost ready to throw herself into his arms, when Colonel Brandon appeared. END
BEGIN NOW It was too great a shock to be borne with calmness, and she immediately left the room. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor was disappointed too; but at the same time her regard for Colonel Brandon ensured his welcome with her; and she felt particularly hurt that a man so partial to her sister should perceive that she experienced nothing but grief and disappointment in seeing him. END
BEGIN NOW She instantly saw that it was not unnoticed by him, that he even observed Marianne as she quitted the room, with such astonishment and concern, as hardly left him the recollection of what civility demanded towards herself. END
BEGIN NOW Is your sister ill? END
BEGIN NOW said he. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor answered in some distress that she was, and then talked of head-aches, low spirits, and over fatigues; and of every thing to which she could decently attribute her sister's behaviour. END
BEGIN NOW He heard her with the most earnest attention, but seeming to recollect himself, said no more on the subject, and began directly to speak of his pleasure at seeing them in London, making the usual inquiries about their journey, and the friends they had left behind. END
BEGIN NOW In this calm kind of way, with very little interest on either side, they continued to talk, both of them out of spirits, and the thoughts of both engaged elsewhere. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor wished very much to ask whether Willoughby were then in town, but she was afraid of giving him pain by any enquiry after his rival; and at length, by way of saying something, she asked if he had been in London ever since she had seen him last. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, he replied, with some embarrassment, almost ever since; I have been once or twice at Delaford for a few days, but it has never been in my power to return to Barton. END
BEGIN NOW This, and the manner in which it was said, immediately brought back to her remembrance all the circumstances of his quitting that place, with the uneasiness and suspicions they had caused to Mrs. Jennings, and she was fearful that her question had implied much more curiosity on the subject than she had ever felt. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Jennings soon came in. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW Colonel, said she, with her usual noisy cheerfulness, I am monstrous glad to see you&mdash;sorry I could not come before&mdash;beg your pardon, but I have been forced to look about me a little, and settle my matters; for it is a long while since I have been at home, and you know one has always a world of little odd things to do after one has been away for any time; and then I have had Cartwright to settle with&mdash; Lord, I have been as busy as a bee ever since dinner! END
BEGIN NOW But pray, Colonel, how came you to conjure out that I should be in town today? END
BEGIN NOW I had the pleasure of hearing it at Mr. Palmer's, where I have been dining. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, you did; well, and how do they all do at their house? END
BEGIN NOW How does Charlotte do? END
BEGIN NOW I warrant you she is a fine size by this time. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Palmer appeared quite well, and I am commissioned to tell you, that you will certainly see her to-morrow. END
BEGIN NOW Ay, to be sure, I thought as much. END
BEGIN NOW Well, Colonel, I have brought two young ladies with me, you see&mdash;that is, you see but one of them now, but there is another somewhere. END
BEGIN NOW Your friend, Miss Marianne, too&mdash;which you will not be sorry to hear. END
BEGIN NOW I do not know what you and Mr. Willoughby will do between you about her. END
BEGIN NOW Ay, it is a fine thing to be young and handsome. END
BEGIN NOW Well! END
BEGIN NOW I was young once, but I never was very handsome&mdash;worse luck for me. END
BEGIN NOW However, I got a very good husband, and I don't know what the greatest beauty can do more. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW poor man! END
BEGIN NOW he has been dead these eight years and better. END
BEGIN NOW But Colonel, where have you been to since we parted? END
BEGIN NOW And how does your business go on? END
BEGIN NOW Come, come, let's have no secrets among friends. END
BEGIN NOW He replied with his accustomary mildness to all her inquiries, but without satisfying her in any. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor now began to make the tea, and Marianne was obliged to appear again. END
BEGIN NOW After her entrance, Colonel Brandon became more thoughtful and silent than he had been before, and Mrs. Jennings could not prevail on him to stay long. END
BEGIN NOW No other visitor appeared that evening, and the ladies were unanimous in agreeing to go early to bed. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne rose the next morning with recovered spirits and happy looks. END
BEGIN NOW The disappointment of the evening before seemed forgotten in the expectation of what was to happen that day. END
BEGIN NOW They had not long finished their breakfast before Mrs. Palmer's barouche stopped at the door, and in a few minutes she came laughing into the room: so delighted to see them all, that it was hard to say whether she received most pleasure from meeting her mother or the Miss Dashwoods again. END
BEGIN NOW So surprised at their coming to town, though it was what she had rather expected all along; so angry at their accepting her mother's invitation after having declined her own, though at the same time she would never have forgiven them if they had not come! END
BEGIN NOW Mr. Palmer will be so happy to see you, said she; What do you think he said when he heard of your coming with Mama? END
BEGIN NOW I forget what it was now, but it was something so droll! END
BEGIN NOW After an hour or two spent in what her mother called comfortable chat, or in other words, in every variety of inquiry concerning all their acquaintance on Mrs. Jennings's side, and in laughter without cause on Mrs. Palmer's, it was proposed by the latter that they should all accompany her to some shops where she had business that morning, to which Mrs. Jennings and Elinor readily consented, as having likewise some purchases to make themselves; and Marianne, though declining it at first was induced to go likewise. END
BEGIN NOW Wherever they went, she was evidently always on the watch. END
BEGIN NOW In Bond Street especially, where much of their business lay, her eyes were in constant inquiry; and in whatever shop the party were engaged, her mind was equally abstracted from every thing actually before them, from all that interested and occupied the others. END
BEGIN NOW Restless and dissatisfied every where, her sister could never obtain her opinion of any article of purchase, however it might equally concern them both: she received no pleasure from anything; was only impatient to be at home again, and could with difficulty govern her vexation at the tediousness of Mrs. Palmer, whose eye was caught by every thing pretty, expensive, or new; who was wild to buy all, could determine on none, and dawdled away her time in rapture and indecision. END
BEGIN NOW It was late in the morning before they returned home; and no sooner had they entered the house than Marianne flew eagerly up stairs, and when Elinor followed, she found her turning from the table with a sorrowful countenance, which declared that no Willoughby had been there. END
BEGIN NOW Has no letter been left here for me since we went out? END
BEGIN NOW said she to the footman who then entered with the parcels. END
BEGIN NOW She was answered in the negative. END
BEGIN NOW Are you quite sure of it? END
BEGIN NOW she replied. END
BEGIN NOW Are you certain that no servant, no porter has left any letter or note? END
BEGIN NOW The man replied that none had. END
BEGIN NOW How very odd! END
BEGIN NOW said she, in a low and disappointed voice, as she turned away to the window. END
BEGIN NOW How odd, indeed! END
BEGIN NOW repeated Elinor within herself, regarding her sister with uneasiness. END
BEGIN NOW If she had not known him to be in town she would not have written to him, as she did; she would have written to Combe Magna; and if he is in town, how odd that he should neither come nor write! END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW my dear mother, you must be wrong in permitting an engagement between a daughter so young, a man so little known, to be carried on in so doubtful, so mysterious a manner! END
BEGIN NOW I long to inquire; and how will MY interference be borne. END
BEGIN NOW She determined, after some consideration, that if appearances continued many days longer as unpleasant as they now were, she would represent in the strongest manner to her mother the necessity of some serious enquiry into the affair. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Palmer and two elderly ladies of Mrs. Jennings's intimate acquaintance, whom she had met and invited in the morning, dined with them. END
BEGIN NOW The former left them soon after tea to fulfill her evening engagements; and Elinor was obliged to assist in making a whist table for the others. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne was of no use on these occasions, as she would never learn the game; but though her time was therefore at her own disposal, the evening was by no means more productive of pleasure to her than to Elinor, for it was spent in all the anxiety of expectation and the pain of disappointment. END
BEGIN NOW She sometimes endeavoured for a few minutes to read; but the book was soon thrown aside, and she returned to the more interesting employment of walking backwards and forwards across the room, pausing for a moment whenever she came to the window, in hopes of distinguishing the long-expected rap. END
BEGIN NOW If this open weather holds much longer, said Mrs. Jennings, when they met at breakfast the following morning, Sir John will not like leaving Barton next week; 'tis a sad thing for sportsmen to lose a day's pleasure. END
BEGIN NOW Poor souls! END
BEGIN NOW I always pity them when they do; they seem to take it so much to heart. END
BEGIN NOW That is true, cried Marianne, in a cheerful voice, and walking to the window as she spoke, to examine the day. END
BEGIN NOW I had not thought of that. END
BEGIN NOW This weather will keep many sportsmen in the country. END
BEGIN NOW It was a lucky recollection, all her good spirits were restored by it. END
BEGIN NOW It is charming weather for THEM indeed, she continued, as she sat down to the breakfast table with a happy countenance. END
BEGIN NOW How much they must enjoy it! END
BEGIN NOW But (with a little return of anxiety) it cannot be expected to last long. END
BEGIN NOW At this time of the year, and after such a series of rain, we shall certainly have very little more of it. END
BEGIN NOW Frosts will soon set in, and in all probability with severity. END
BEGIN NOW In another day or two perhaps; this extreme mildness can hardly last longer&mdash;nay, perhaps it may freeze tonight! END
BEGIN NOW At any rate, said Elinor, wishing to prevent Mrs. Jennings from seeing her sister's thoughts as clearly as she did, I dare say we shall have Sir John and Lady Middleton in town by the end of next week. END
BEGIN NOW Ay, my dear, I'll warrant you we do. END
BEGIN NOW Mary always has her own way. END
BEGIN NOW And now, silently conjectured Elinor, she will write to Combe by this day's post. END
BEGIN NOW But if she DID, the letter was written and sent away with a privacy which eluded all her watchfulness to ascertain the fact. END
BEGIN NOW Whatever the truth of it might be, and far as Elinor was from feeling thorough contentment about it, yet while she saw Marianne in spirits, she could not be very uncomfortable herself. END
BEGIN NOW And Marianne was in spirits; happy in the mildness of the weather, and still happier in her expectation of a frost. END
BEGIN NOW The morning was chiefly spent in leaving cards at the houses of Mrs. Jennings's acquaintance to inform them of her being in town; and Marianne was all the time busy in observing the direction of the wind, watching the variations of the sky and imagining an alteration in the air. END
BEGIN NOW Don't you find it colder than it was in the morning, Elinor? END
BEGIN NOW There seems to me a very decided difference. END
BEGIN NOW I can hardly keep my hands warm even in my muff. END
BEGIN NOW It was not so yesterday, I think. END
BEGIN NOW The clouds seem parting too, the sun will be out in a moment, and we shall have a clear afternoon. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor was alternately diverted and pained; but Marianne persevered, and saw every night in the brightness of the fire, and every morning in the appearance of the atmosphere, the certain symptoms of approaching frost. END
BEGIN NOW The Miss Dashwoods had no greater reason to be dissatisfied with Mrs. Jennings's style of living, and set of acquaintance, than with her behaviour to themselves, which was invariably kind. END
BEGIN NOW Every thing in her household arrangements was conducted on the most liberal plan, and excepting a few old city friends, whom, to Lady Middleton's regret, she had never dropped, she visited no one to whom an introduction could at all discompose the feelings of her young companions. END
BEGIN NOW Pleased to find herself more comfortably situated in that particular than she had expected, Elinor was very willing to compound for the want of much real enjoyment from any of their evening parties, which, whether at home or abroad, formed only for cards, could have little to amuse her. END
BEGIN NOW Colonel Brandon, who had a general invitation to the house, was with them almost every day; he came to look at Marianne and talk to Elinor, who often derived more satisfaction from conversing with him than from any other daily occurrence, but who saw at the same time with much concern his continued regard for her sister. END
BEGIN NOW She feared it was a strengthening regard. END
BEGIN NOW It grieved her to see the earnestness with which he often watched Marianne, and his spirits were certainly worse than when at Barton. END
BEGIN NOW About a week after their arrival, it became certain that Willoughby was also arrived. END
BEGIN NOW His card was on the table when they came in from the morning's drive. END
BEGIN NOW Good God! END
BEGIN NOW cried Marianne, he has been here while we were out. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor, rejoiced to be assured of his being in London, now ventured to say, Depend upon it, he will call again tomorrow. END
BEGIN NOW But Marianne seemed hardly to hear her, and on Mrs. Jennings's entrance, escaped with the precious card. END
BEGIN NOW This event, while it raised the spirits of Elinor, restored to those of her sister all, and more than all, their former agitation. END
BEGIN NOW From this moment her mind was never quiet; the expectation of seeing him every hour of the day, made her unfit for any thing. END
BEGIN NOW She insisted on being left behind, the next morning, when the others went out. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor's thoughts were full of what might be passing in Berkeley Street during their absence; but a moment's glance at her sister when they returned was enough to inform her, that Willoughby had paid no second visit there. END
BEGIN NOW A note was just then brought in, and laid on the table. END
BEGIN NOW For me! END
BEGIN NOW cried Marianne, stepping hastily forward. END
BEGIN NOW No, ma'am, for my mistress. END
BEGIN NOW But Marianne, not convinced, took it instantly up. END
BEGIN NOW It is indeed for Mrs. Jennings; how provoking! END
BEGIN NOW You are expecting a letter, then? END
BEGIN NOW said Elinor, unable to be longer silent. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, a little&mdash;not much. END
BEGIN NOW After a short pause. END
BEGIN NOW You have no confidence in me, Marianne. END
BEGIN NOW Nay, Elinor, this reproach from YOU&mdash;you who have confidence in no one! END
BEGIN NOW Me! END
BEGIN NOW returned Elinor in some confusion; indeed, Marianne, I have nothing to tell. END
BEGIN NOW Nor I, answered Marianne with energy, our situations then are alike. END
BEGIN NOW We have neither of us any thing to tell; you, because you do not communicate, and I, because I conceal nothing. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor, distressed by this charge of reserve in herself, which she was not at liberty to do away, knew not how, under such circumstances, to press for greater openness in Marianne. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Jennings soon appeared, and the note being given her, she read it aloud. END
BEGIN NOW It was from Lady Middleton, announcing their arrival in Conduit Street the night before, and requesting the company of her mother and cousins the following evening. END
BEGIN NOW Business on Sir John's part, and a violent cold on her own, prevented their calling in Berkeley Street. END
BEGIN NOW The invitation was accepted; but when the hour of appointment drew near, necessary as it was in common civility to Mrs. Jennings, that they should both attend her on such a visit, Elinor had some difficulty in persuading her sister to go, for still she had seen nothing of Willoughby; and therefore was not more indisposed for amusement abroad, than unwilling to run the risk of his calling again in her absence. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor found, when the evening was over, that disposition is not materially altered by a change of abode, for although scarcely settled in town, Sir John had contrived to collect around him, nearly twenty young people, and to amuse them with a ball. END
BEGIN NOW This was an affair, however, of which Lady Middleton did not approve. END
BEGIN NOW In the country, an unpremeditated dance was very allowable; but in London, where the reputation of elegance was more important and less easily attained, it was risking too much for the gratification of a few girls, to have it known that Lady Middleton had given a small dance of eight or nine couple, with two violins, and a mere side-board collation. END
BEGIN NOW Mr. and Mrs. Palmer were of the party; from the former, whom they had not seen before since their arrival in town, as he was careful to avoid the appearance of any attention to his mother-in-law, and therefore never came near her, they received no mark of recognition on their entrance. END
BEGIN NOW He looked at them slightly, without seeming to know who they were, and merely nodded to Mrs. Jennings from the other side of the room. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne gave one glance round the apartment as she entered: it was enough&mdash;HE was not there&mdash;and she sat down, equally ill-disposed to receive or communicate pleasure. END
BEGIN NOW After they had been assembled about an hour, Mr. Palmer sauntered towards the Miss Dashwoods to express his surprise on seeing them in town, though Colonel Brandon had been first informed of their arrival at his house, and he had himself said something very droll on hearing that they were to come. END
BEGIN NOW I thought you were both in Devonshire, said he. END
BEGIN NOW Did you? END
BEGIN NOW replied Elinor. END
BEGIN NOW When do you go back again? END
BEGIN NOW I do not know. END
BEGIN NOW And thus ended their discourse. END
BEGIN NOW Never had Marianne been so unwilling to dance in her life, as she was that evening, and never so much fatigued by the exercise. END
BEGIN NOW She complained of it as they returned to Berkeley Street. END
BEGIN NOW Aye, aye, said Mrs. Jennings, we know the reason of all that very well; if a certain person who shall be nameless, had been there, you would not have been a bit tired: and to say the truth it was not very pretty of him not to give you the meeting when he was invited. END
BEGIN NOW Invited! END
BEGIN NOW cried Marianne. END
BEGIN NOW So my daughter Middleton told me, for it seems Sir John met him somewhere in the street this morning. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne said no more, but looked exceedingly hurt. END
BEGIN NOW Impatient in this situation to be doing something that might lead to her sister's relief, Elinor resolved to write the next morning to her mother, and hoped by awakening her fears for the health of Marianne, to procure those inquiries which had been so long delayed; and she was still more eagerly bent on this measure by perceiving after breakfast on the morrow, that Marianne was again writing to Willoughby, for she could not suppose it to be to any other person. END
BEGIN NOW About the middle of the day, Mrs. Jennings went out by herself on business, and Elinor began her letter directly, while Marianne, too restless for employment, too anxious for conversation, walked from one window to the other, or sat down by the fire in melancholy meditation. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor was very earnest in her application to her mother, relating all that had passed, her suspicions of Willoughby's inconstancy, urging her by every plea of duty and affection to demand from Marianne an account of her real situation with respect to him. END
BEGIN NOW Her letter was scarcely finished, when a rap foretold a visitor, and Colonel Brandon was announced. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne, who had seen him from the window, and who hated company of any kind, left the room before he entered it. END
BEGIN NOW He looked more than usually grave, and though expressing satisfaction at finding Miss Dashwood alone, as if he had somewhat in particular to tell her, sat for some time without saying a word. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor, persuaded that he had some communication to make in which her sister was concerned, impatiently expected its opening. END
BEGIN NOW It was not the first time of her feeling the same kind of conviction; for, more than once before, beginning with the observation of your sister looks unwell to-day, or your sister seems out of spirits, he had appeared on the point, either of disclosing, or of inquiring, something particular about her. END
BEGIN NOW After a pause of several minutes, their silence was broken, by his asking her in a voice of some agitation, when he was to congratulate her on the acquisition of a brother? END
BEGIN NOW Elinor was not prepared for such a question, and having no answer ready, was obliged to adopt the simple and common expedient, of asking what he meant? END
BEGIN NOW He tried to smile as he replied, your sister's engagement to Mr. Willoughby is very generally known. END
BEGIN NOW It cannot be generally known, returned Elinor, for her own family do not know it. END
BEGIN NOW He looked surprised and said, I beg your pardon, I am afraid my inquiry has been impertinent; but I had not supposed any secrecy intended, as they openly correspond, and their marriage is universally talked of. END
BEGIN NOW How can that be? END
BEGIN NOW By whom can you have heard it mentioned? END
BEGIN NOW By many&mdash;by some of whom you know nothing, by others with whom you are most intimate, Mrs. Jennings, Mrs. Palmer, and the Middletons. END
BEGIN NOW But still I might not have believed it, for where the mind is perhaps rather unwilling to be convinced, it will always find something to support its doubts, if I had not, when the servant let me in today, accidentally seen a letter in his hand, directed to Mr. Willoughby in your sister's writing. END
BEGIN NOW I came to inquire, but I was convinced before I could ask the question. END
BEGIN NOW Is every thing finally settled? END
BEGIN NOW Is it impossible to-? END
BEGIN NOW But I have no right, and I could have no chance of succeeding. END
BEGIN NOW Excuse me, Miss Dashwood. END
BEGIN NOW I believe I have been wrong in saying so much, but I hardly know what to do, and on your prudence I have the strongest dependence. END
BEGIN NOW Tell me that it is all absolutely resolved on, that any attempt, that in short concealment, if concealment be possible, is all that remains. END
BEGIN NOW These words, which conveyed to Elinor a direct avowal of his love for her sister, affected her very much. END
BEGIN NOW She was not immediately able to say anything, and even when her spirits were recovered, she debated for a short time, on the answer it would be most proper to give. END
BEGIN NOW The real state of things between Willoughby and her sister was so little known to herself, that in endeavouring to explain it, she might be as liable to say too much as too little. END
BEGIN NOW Yet as she was convinced that Marianne's affection for Willoughby, could leave no hope of Colonel Brandon's success, whatever the event of that affection might be, and at the same time wished to shield her conduct from censure, she thought it most prudent and kind, after some consideration, to say more than she really knew or believed. END
BEGIN NOW She acknowledged, therefore, that though she had never been informed by themselves of the terms on which they stood with each other, of their mutual affection she had no doubt, and of their correspondence she was not astonished to hear. END
BEGIN NOW He listened to her with silent attention, and on her ceasing to speak, rose directly from his seat, and after saying in a voice of emotion, to your sister I wish all imaginable happiness; to Willoughby that he may endeavour to deserve her, &mdash;took leave, and went away. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor derived no comfortable feelings from this conversation, to lessen the uneasiness of her mind on other points; she was left, on the contrary, with a melancholy impression of Colonel Brandon's unhappiness, and was prevented even from wishing it removed, by her anxiety for the very event that must confirm it. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing occurred during the next three or four days, to make Elinor regret what she had done, in applying to her mother; for Willoughby neither came nor wrote. END
BEGIN NOW They were engaged about the end of that time to attend Lady Middleton to a party, from which Mrs. Jennings was kept away by the indisposition of her youngest daughter; and for this party, Marianne, wholly dispirited, careless of her appearance, and seeming equally indifferent whether she went or staid, prepared, without one look of hope or one expression of pleasure. END
BEGIN NOW She sat by the drawing-room fire after tea, till the moment of Lady Middleton's arrival, without once stirring from her seat, or altering her attitude, lost in her own thoughts, and insensible of her sister's presence; and when at last they were told that Lady Middleton waited for them at the door, she started as if she had forgotten that any one was expected. END
BEGIN NOW They arrived in due time at the place of destination, and as soon as the string of carriages before them would allow, alighted, ascended the stairs, heard their names announced from one landing-place to another in an audible voice, and entered a room splendidly lit up, quite full of company, and insufferably hot. END
BEGIN NOW When they had paid their tribute of politeness by curtsying to the lady of the house, they were permitted to mingle in the crowd, and take their share of the heat and inconvenience, to which their arrival must necessarily add. END
BEGIN NOW After some time spent in saying little or doing less, Lady Middleton sat down to Cassino, and as Marianne was not in spirits for moving about, she and Elinor luckily succeeding to chairs, placed themselves at no great distance from the table. END
BEGIN NOW They had not remained in this manner long, before Elinor perceived Willoughby, standing within a few yards of them, in earnest conversation with a very fashionable looking young woman. END
BEGIN NOW She soon caught his eye, and he immediately bowed, but without attempting to speak to her, or to approach Marianne, though he could not but see her; and then continued his discourse with the same lady. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor turned involuntarily to Marianne, to see whether it could be unobserved by her. END
BEGIN NOW At that moment she first perceived him, and her whole countenance glowing with sudden delight, she would have moved towards him instantly, had not her sister caught hold of her. END
BEGIN NOW Good heavens! END
BEGIN NOW she exclaimed, he is there&mdash;he is there&mdash;Oh! END
BEGIN NOW why does he not look at me? END
BEGIN NOW why cannot I speak to him? END
BEGIN NOW Pray, pray be composed, cried Elinor, and do not betray what you feel to every body present. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps he has not observed you yet. END
BEGIN NOW This however was more than she could believe herself; and to be composed at such a moment was not only beyond the reach of Marianne, it was beyond her wish. END
BEGIN NOW She sat in an agony of impatience which affected every feature. END
BEGIN NOW At last he turned round again, and regarded them both; she started up, and pronouncing his name in a tone of affection, held out her hand to him. END
BEGIN NOW He approached, and addressing himself rather to Elinor than Marianne, as if wishing to avoid her eye, and determined not to observe her attitude, inquired in a hurried manner after Mrs. Dashwood, and asked how long they had been in town. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor was robbed of all presence of mind by such an address, and was unable to say a word. END
BEGIN NOW But the feelings of her sister were instantly expressed. END
BEGIN NOW Her face was crimsoned over, and she exclaimed, in a voice of the greatest emotion, Good God! END
BEGIN NOW Willoughby, what is the meaning of this? END
BEGIN NOW Have you not received my letters? END
BEGIN NOW Will you not shake hands with me? END
BEGIN NOW He could not then avoid it, but her touch seemed painful to him, and he held her hand only for a moment. END
BEGIN NOW During all this time he was evidently struggling for composure. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor watched his countenance and saw its expression becoming more tranquil. END
BEGIN NOW After a moment's pause, he spoke with calmness. END
BEGIN NOW I did myself the honour of calling in Berkeley Street last Tuesday, and very much regretted that I was not fortunate enough to find yourselves and Mrs. Jennings at home. END
BEGIN NOW My card was not lost, I hope. END
BEGIN NOW But have you not received my notes? END
BEGIN NOW cried Marianne in the wildest anxiety. END
BEGIN NOW Here is some mistake I am sure&mdash;some dreadful mistake. END
BEGIN NOW What can be the meaning of it? END
BEGIN NOW Tell me, Willoughby; for heaven's sake tell me, what is the matter? END
BEGIN NOW He made no reply; his complexion changed and all his embarrassment returned; but as if, on catching the eye of the young lady with whom he had been previously talking, he felt the necessity of instant exertion, he recovered himself again, and after saying, Yes, I had the pleasure of receiving the information of your arrival in town, which you were so good as to send me, turned hastily away with a slight bow and joined his friend. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne, now looking dreadfully white, and unable to stand, sunk into her chair, and Elinor, expecting every moment to see her faint, tried to screen her from the observation of others, while reviving her with lavender water. END
BEGIN NOW Go to him, Elinor, she cried, as soon as she could speak, and force him to come to me. END
BEGIN NOW Tell him I must see him again&mdash;must speak to him instantly.&mdash; I cannot rest&mdash;I shall not have a moment's peace till this is explained&mdash;some dreadful misapprehension or other.&mdash; Oh go to him this moment. END
BEGIN NOW How can that be done? END
BEGIN NOW No, my dearest Marianne, you must wait. END
BEGIN NOW This is not the place for explanations. END
BEGIN NOW Wait only till tomorrow. END
BEGIN NOW With difficulty however could she prevent her from following him herself; and to persuade her to check her agitation, to wait, at least, with the appearance of composure, till she might speak to him with more privacy and more effect, was impossible; for Marianne continued incessantly to give way in a low voice to the misery of her feelings, by exclamations of wretchedness. END
BEGIN NOW In a short time Elinor saw Willoughby quit the room by the door towards the staircase, and telling Marianne that he was gone, urged the impossibility of speaking to him again that evening, as a fresh argument for her to be calm. END
BEGIN NOW She instantly begged her sister would entreat Lady Middleton to take them home, as she was too miserable to stay a minute longer. END
BEGIN NOW Lady Middleton, though in the middle of a rubber, on being informed that Marianne was unwell, was too polite to object for a moment to her wish of going away, and making over her cards to a friend, they departed as soon the carriage could be found. END
BEGIN NOW Scarcely a word was spoken during their return to Berkeley Street. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne was in a silent agony, too much oppressed even for tears; but as Mrs. Jennings was luckily not come home, they could go directly to their own room, where hartshorn restored her a little to herself. END
BEGIN NOW She was soon undressed and in bed, and as she seemed desirous of being alone, her sister then left her, and while she waited the return of Mrs. Jennings, had leisure enough for thinking over the past. END
BEGIN NOW That some kind of engagement had subsisted between Willoughby and Marianne she could not doubt, and that Willoughby was weary of it, seemed equally clear; for however Marianne might still feed her own wishes, SHE could not attribute such behaviour to mistake or misapprehension of any kind. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing but a thorough change of sentiment could account for it. END
BEGIN NOW Her indignation would have been still stronger than it was, had she not witnessed that embarrassment which seemed to speak a consciousness of his own misconduct, and prevented her from believing him so unprincipled as to have been sporting with the affections of her sister from the first, without any design that would bear investigation. END
BEGIN NOW Absence might have weakened his regard, and convenience might have determined him to overcome it, but that such a regard had formerly existed she could not bring herself to doubt. END
BEGIN NOW As for Marianne, on the pangs which so unhappy a meeting must already have given her, and on those still more severe which might await her in its probable consequence, she could not reflect without the deepest concern. END
BEGIN NOW Her own situation gained in the comparison; for while she could ESTEEM Edward as much as ever, however they might be divided in future, her mind might be always supported. END
BEGIN NOW But every circumstance that could embitter such an evil seemed uniting to heighten the misery of Marianne in a final separation from Willoughby&mdash;in an immediate and irreconcilable rupture with him. END
BEGIN NOW Before the house-maid had lit their fire the next day, or the sun gained any power over a cold, gloomy morning in January, Marianne, only half dressed, was kneeling against one of the window-seats for the sake of all the little light she could command from it, and writing as fast as a continual flow of tears would permit her. END
BEGIN NOW In this situation, Elinor, roused from sleep by her agitation and sobs, first perceived her; and after observing her for a few moments with silent anxiety, said, in a tone of the most considerate gentleness, Marianne, may I ask-? END
BEGIN NOW No, Elinor, she replied, ask nothing; you will soon know all. END
BEGIN NOW The sort of desperate calmness with which this was said, lasted no longer than while she spoke, and was immediately followed by a return of the same excessive affliction. END
BEGIN NOW It was some minutes before she could go on with her letter, and the frequent bursts of grief which still obliged her, at intervals, to withhold her pen, were proofs enough of her feeling how more than probable it was that she was writing for the last time to Willoughby. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor paid her every quiet and unobtrusive attention in her power; and she would have tried to sooth and tranquilize her still more, had not Marianne entreated her, with all the eagerness of the most nervous irritability, not to speak to her for the world. END
BEGIN NOW In such circumstances, it was better for both that they should not be long together; and the restless state of Marianne's mind not only prevented her from remaining in the room a moment after she was dressed, but requiring at once solitude and continual change of place, made her wander about the house till breakfast time, avoiding the sight of every body. END
BEGIN NOW At breakfast she neither ate, nor attempted to eat any thing; and Elinor's attention was then all employed, not in urging her, not in pitying her, nor in appearing to regard her, but in endeavouring to engage Mrs. Jennings's notice entirely to herself. END
BEGIN NOW As this was a favourite meal with Mrs. Jennings, it lasted a considerable time, and they were just setting themselves, after it, round the common working table, when a letter was delivered to Marianne, which she eagerly caught from the servant, and, turning of a death-like paleness, instantly ran out of the room. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor, who saw as plainly by this, as if she had seen the direction, that it must come from Willoughby, felt immediately such a sickness at heart as made her hardly able to hold up her head, and sat in such a general tremour as made her fear it impossible to escape Mrs. Jennings's notice. END
BEGIN NOW That good lady, however, saw only that Marianne had received a letter from Willoughby, which appeared to her a very good joke, and which she treated accordingly, by hoping, with a laugh, that she would find it to her liking. END
BEGIN NOW Of Elinor's distress, she was too busily employed in measuring lengths of worsted for her rug, to see any thing at all; and calmly continuing her talk, as soon as Marianne disappeared, she said, Upon my word, I never saw a young woman so desperately in love in my life! END
BEGIN NOW MY girls were nothing to her, and yet they used to be foolish enough; but as for Miss Marianne, she is quite an altered creature. END
BEGIN NOW I hope, from the bottom of my heart, he won't keep her waiting much longer, for it is quite grievous to see her look so ill and forlorn. END
BEGIN NOW Pray, when are they to be married? END
BEGIN NOW Elinor, though never less disposed to speak than at that moment, obliged herself to answer such an attack as this, and, therefore, trying to smile, replied, And have you really, Ma'am, talked yourself into a persuasion of my sister's being engaged to Mr. Willoughby? END
BEGIN NOW I thought it had been only a joke, but so serious a question seems to imply more; and I must beg, therefore, that you will not deceive yourself any longer. END
BEGIN NOW I do assure you that nothing would surprise me more than to hear of their being going to be married. END
BEGIN NOW For shame, for shame, Miss Dashwood! END
BEGIN NOW how can you talk so? END
BEGIN NOW Don't we all know that it must be a match, that they were over head and ears in love with each other from the first moment they met? END
BEGIN NOW Did not I see them together in Devonshire every day, and all day long; and did not I know that your sister came to town with me on purpose to buy wedding clothes? END
BEGIN NOW Come, come, this won't do. END
BEGIN NOW Because you are so sly about it yourself, you think nobody else has any senses; but it is no such thing, I can tell you, for it has been known all over town this ever so long. END
BEGIN NOW I tell every body of it and so does Charlotte. END
BEGIN NOW Indeed, Ma'am, said Elinor, very seriously, you are mistaken. END
BEGIN NOW Indeed, you are doing a very unkind thing in spreading the report, and you will find that you have though you will not believe me now. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Jennings laughed again, but Elinor had not spirits to say more, and eager at all events to know what Willoughby had written, hurried away to their room, where, on opening the door, she saw Marianne stretched on the bed, almost choked by grief, one letter in her hand, and two or three others laying by her. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor drew near, but without saying a word; and seating herself on the bed, took her hand, kissed her affectionately several times, and then gave way to a burst of tears, which at first was scarcely less violent than Marianne's. END
BEGIN NOW The latter, though unable to speak, seemed to feel all the tenderness of this behaviour, and after some time thus spent in joint affliction, she put all the letters into Elinor's hands; and then covering her face with her handkerchief, almost screamed with agony. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor, who knew that such grief, shocking as it was to witness it, must have its course, watched by her till this excess of suffering had somewhat spent itself, and then turning eagerly to Willoughby's letter, read as follows: Bond Street, January. END
BEGIN NOW MY DEAR MADAM, I have just had the honour of receiving your letter, for which I beg to return my sincere acknowledgments. END
BEGIN NOW I am much concerned to find there was anything in my behaviour last night that did not meet your approbation; and though I am quite at a loss to discover in what point I could be so unfortunate as to offend you, I entreat your forgiveness of what I can assure you to have been perfectly unintentional. END
BEGIN NOW I shall never reflect on my former acquaintance with your family in Devonshire without the most grateful pleasure, and flatter myself it will not be broken by any mistake or misapprehension of my actions. END
BEGIN NOW My esteem for your whole family is very sincere; but if I have been so unfortunate as to give rise to a belief of more than I felt, or meant to express, I shall reproach myself for not having been more guarded in my professions of that esteem. END
BEGIN NOW That I should ever have meant more you will allow to be impossible, when you understand that my affections have been long engaged elsewhere, and it will not be many weeks, I believe, before this engagement is fulfilled. END
BEGIN NOW It is with great regret that I obey your commands in returning the letters with which I have been honoured from you, and the lock of hair, which you so obligingly bestowed on me. END
BEGIN NOW I am, dear Madam, Your most obedient humble servant, JOHN WILLOUGHBY. END
BEGIN NOW With what indignation such a letter as this must be read by Miss Dashwood, may be imagined. END
BEGIN NOW Though aware, before she began it, that it must bring a confession of his inconstancy, and confirm their separation for ever, she was not aware that such language could be suffered to announce it; nor could she have supposed Willoughby capable of departing so far from the appearance of every honourable and delicate feeling&mdash;so far from the common decorum of a gentleman, as to send a letter so impudently cruel: a letter which, instead of bringing with his desire of a release any professions of regret, acknowledged no breach of faith, denied all peculiar affection whatever&mdash;a letter of which every line was an insult, and which proclaimed its writer to be deep in hardened villainy. END
BEGIN NOW She paused over it for some time with indignant astonishment; then read it again and again; but every perusal only served to increase her abhorrence of the man, and so bitter were her feelings against him, that she dared not trust herself to speak, lest she might wound Marianne still deeper by treating their disengagement, not as a loss to her of any possible good but as an escape from the worst and most irremediable of all evils, a connection, for life, with an unprincipled man, as a deliverance the most real, a blessing the most important. END
BEGIN NOW In her earnest meditations on the contents of the letter, on the depravity of that mind which could dictate it, and probably, on the very different mind of a very different person, who had no other connection whatever with the affair than what her heart gave him with every thing that passed, Elinor forgot the immediate distress of her sister, forgot that she had three letters on her lap yet unread, and so entirely forgot how long she had been in the room, that when on hearing a carriage drive up to the door, she went to the window to see who could be coming so unreasonably early, she was all astonishment to perceive Mrs. Jennings's chariot, which she knew had not been ordered till one. END
BEGIN NOW Determined not to quit Marianne, though hopeless of contributing, at present, to her ease, she hurried away to excuse herself from attending Mrs. Jennings, on account of her sister being indisposed. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Jennings, with a thoroughly good-humoured concern for its cause, admitted the excuse most readily, and Elinor, after seeing her safe off, returned to Marianne, whom she found attempting to rise from the bed, and whom she reached just in time to prevent her from falling on the floor, faint and giddy from a long want of proper rest and food; for it was many days since she had any appetite, and many nights since she had really slept; and now, when her mind was no longer supported by the fever of suspense, the consequence of all this was felt in an aching head, a weakened stomach, and a general nervous faintness. END
BEGIN NOW A glass of wine, which Elinor procured for her directly, made her more comfortable, and she was at last able to express some sense of her kindness, by saying, Poor Elinor! END
BEGIN NOW how unhappy I make you! END
BEGIN NOW I only wish, replied her sister, there were any thing I COULD do, which might be of comfort to you. END
BEGIN NOW This, as every thing else would have been, was too much for Marianne, who could only exclaim, in the anguish of her heart, Oh! END
BEGIN NOW Elinor, I am miserable, indeed, before her voice was entirely lost in sobs. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor could no longer witness this torrent of unresisted grief in silence. END
BEGIN NOW Exert yourself, dear Marianne, she cried, if you would not kill yourself and all who love you. END
BEGIN NOW Think of your mother; think of her misery while YOU suffer: for her sake you must exert yourself. END
BEGIN NOW I cannot, I cannot, cried Marianne; leave me, leave me, if I distress you; leave me, hate me, forget me! END
BEGIN NOW but do not torture me so. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW how easy for those, who have no sorrow of their own to talk of exertion! END
BEGIN NOW Happy, happy Elinor, YOU cannot have an idea of what I suffer. END
BEGIN NOW Do you call ME happy, Marianne? END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW if you knew!&mdash;And can you believe me to be so, while I see you so wretched! END
BEGIN NOW Forgive me, forgive me, throwing her arms round her sister's neck; I know you feel for me; I know what a heart you have; but yet you are&mdash;you must be happy; Edward loves you&mdash;what, oh what, can do away such happiness as that? END
BEGIN NOW Many, many circumstances, said Elinor, solemnly. END
BEGIN NOW No, no, no, cried Marianne wildly, he loves you, and only you. END
BEGIN NOW You CAN have no grief. END
BEGIN NOW I can have no pleasure while I see you in this state. END
BEGIN NOW And you will never see me otherwise. END
BEGIN NOW Mine is a misery which nothing can do away. END
BEGIN NOW You must not talk so, Marianne. END
BEGIN NOW Have you no comforts? END
BEGIN NOW no friends? END
BEGIN NOW Is your loss such as leaves no opening for consolation? END
BEGIN NOW Much as you suffer now, think of what you would have suffered if the discovery of his character had been delayed to a later period&mdash;if your engagement had been carried on for months and months, as it might have been, before he chose to put an end to it. END
BEGIN NOW Every additional day of unhappy confidence, on your side, would have made the blow more dreadful. END
BEGIN NOW Engagement! END
BEGIN NOW cried Marianne, there has been no engagement. END
BEGIN NOW No engagement! END
BEGIN NOW No, he is not so unworthy as you believe him. END
BEGIN NOW He has broken no faith with me. END
BEGIN NOW But he told you that he loved you. END
BEGIN NOW Yes&mdash;no&mdash;never absolutely. END
BEGIN NOW It was every day implied, but never professedly declared. END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes I thought it had been&mdash;but it never was. END
BEGIN NOW Yet you wrote to him? END
BEGIN NOW &mdash; Yes&mdash;could that be wrong after all that had passed?&mdash; But I cannot talk. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor said no more, and turning again to the three letters which now raised a much stronger curiosity than before, directly ran over the contents of all. END
BEGIN NOW The first, which was what her sister had sent him on their arrival in town, was to this effect. END
BEGIN NOW Berkeley Street, January. END
BEGIN NOW How surprised you will be, Willoughby, on receiving this; and I think you will feel something more than surprise, when you know that I am in town. END
BEGIN NOW An opportunity of coming hither, though with Mrs. Jennings, was a temptation we could not resist. END
BEGIN NOW I wish you may receive this in time to come here to-night, but I will not depend on it. END
BEGIN NOW At any rate I shall expect you to-morrow. END
BEGIN NOW For the present, adieu. END
BEGIN NOW M.D. END
BEGIN NOW Her second note, which had been written on the morning after the dance at the Middletons', was in these words:&mdash; I cannot express my disappointment in having missed you the day before yesterday, nor my astonishment at not having received any answer to a note which I sent you above a week ago. END
BEGIN NOW I have been expecting to hear from you, and still more to see you, every hour of the day. END
BEGIN NOW Pray call again as soon as possible, and explain the reason of my having expected this in vain. END
BEGIN NOW You had better come earlier another time, because we are generally out by one. END
BEGIN NOW We were last night at Lady Middleton's, where there was a dance. END
BEGIN NOW I have been told that you were asked to be of the party. END
BEGIN NOW But could it be so? END
BEGIN NOW You must be very much altered indeed since we parted, if that could be the case, and you not there. END
BEGIN NOW But I will not suppose this possible, and I hope very soon to receive your personal assurance of its being otherwise. END
BEGIN NOW M.D. END
BEGIN NOW The contents of her last note to him were these:&mdash; What am I to imagine, Willoughby, by your behaviour last night? END
BEGIN NOW Again I demand an explanation of it. END
BEGIN NOW I was prepared to meet you with the pleasure which our separation naturally produced, with the familiarity which our intimacy at Barton appeared to me to justify. END
BEGIN NOW I was repulsed indeed! END
BEGIN NOW I have passed a wretched night in endeavouring to excuse a conduct which can scarcely be called less than insulting; but though I have not yet been able to form any reasonable apology for your behaviour, I am perfectly ready to hear your justification of it. END
BEGIN NOW You have perhaps been misinformed, or purposely deceived, in something concerning me, which may have lowered me in your opinion. END
BEGIN NOW Tell me what it is, explain the grounds on which you acted, and I shall be satisfied, in being able to satisfy you. END
BEGIN NOW It would grieve me indeed to be obliged to think ill of you; but if I am to do it, if I am to learn that you are not what we have hitherto believed you, that your regard for us all was insincere, that your behaviour to me was intended only to deceive, let it be told as soon as possible. END
BEGIN NOW My feelings are at present in a state of dreadful indecision; I wish to acquit you, but certainty on either side will be ease to what I now suffer. END
BEGIN NOW If your sentiments are no longer what they were, you will return my notes, and the lock of my hair which is in your possession. END
BEGIN NOW M.D. END
BEGIN NOW That such letters, so full of affection and confidence, could have been so answered, Elinor, for Willoughby's sake, would have been unwilling to believe. END
BEGIN NOW But her condemnation of him did not blind her to the impropriety of their having been written at all; and she was silently grieving over the imprudence which had hazarded such unsolicited proofs of tenderness, not warranted by anything preceding, and most severely condemned by the event, when Marianne, perceiving that she had finished the letters, observed to her that they contained nothing but what any one would have written in the same situation. END
BEGIN NOW I felt myself, she added, to be as solemnly engaged to him, as if the strictest legal covenant had bound us to each other. END
BEGIN NOW I can believe it, said Elinor; but unfortunately he did not feel the same. END
BEGIN NOW He DID feel the same, Elinor&mdash;for weeks and weeks he felt it. END
BEGIN NOW I know he did. END
BEGIN NOW Whatever may have changed him now, (and nothing but the blackest art employed against me can have done it), I was once as dear to him as my own soul could wish. END
BEGIN NOW This lock of hair, which now he can so readily give up, was begged of me with the most earnest supplication. END
BEGIN NOW Had you seen his look, his manner, had you heard his voice at that moment! END
BEGIN NOW Have you forgot the last evening of our being together at Barton? END
BEGIN NOW The morning that we parted too! END
BEGIN NOW When he told me that it might be many weeks before we met again&mdash;his distress&mdash;can I ever forget his distress? END
BEGIN NOW For a moment or two she could say no more; but when this emotion had passed away, she added, in a firmer tone, Elinor, I have been cruelly used; but not by Willoughby. END
BEGIN NOW Dearest Marianne, who but himself? END
BEGIN NOW By whom can he have been instigated? END
BEGIN NOW By all the world, rather than by his own heart. END
BEGIN NOW I could rather believe every creature of my acquaintance leagued together to ruin me in his opinion, than believe his nature capable of such cruelty. END
BEGIN NOW This woman of whom he writes&mdash;whoever she be&mdash;or any one, in short, but your own dear self, mama, and Edward, may have been so barbarous to bely me. END
BEGIN NOW Beyond you three, is there a creature in the world whom I would not rather suspect of evil than Willoughby, whose heart I know so well? END
BEGIN NOW Elinor would not contend, and only replied, Whoever may have been so detestably your enemy, let them be cheated of their malignant triumph, my dear sister, by seeing how nobly the consciousness of your own innocence and good intentions supports your spirits. END
BEGIN NOW It is a reasonable and laudable pride which resists such malevolence. END
BEGIN NOW No, no, cried Marianne, misery such as mine has no pride. END
BEGIN NOW I care not who knows that I am wretched. END
BEGIN NOW The triumph of seeing me so may be open to all the world. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor, Elinor, they who suffer little may be proud and independent as they like&mdash;may resist insult, or return mortification&mdash;but I cannot. END
BEGIN NOW I must feel&mdash;I must be wretched&mdash;and they are welcome to enjoy the consciousness of it that can. END
BEGIN NOW But for my mother's sake and mine&mdash; I would do more than for my own. END
BEGIN NOW But to appear happy when I am so miserable&mdash;Oh! END
BEGIN NOW who can require it? END
BEGIN NOW Again they were both silent. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor was employed in walking thoughtfully from the fire to the window, from the window to the fire, without knowing that she received warmth from one, or discerning objects through the other; and Marianne, seated at the foot of the bed, with her head leaning against one of its posts, again took up Willoughby's letter, and, after shuddering over every sentence, exclaimed&mdash; It is too much! END
BEGIN NOW Oh, Willoughby, Willoughby, could this be yours! END
BEGIN NOW Cruel, cruel&mdash;nothing can acquit you. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor, nothing can. END
BEGIN NOW Whatever he might have heard against me&mdash;ought he not to have suspended his belief? END
BEGIN NOW ought he not to have told me of it, to have given me the power of clearing myself? END
BEGIN NOW 'The lock of hair, (repeating it from the letter,) which you so obligingly bestowed on me'&mdash;That is unpardonable. END
BEGIN NOW Willoughby, where was your heart when you wrote those words? END
BEGIN NOW Oh, barbarously insolent!&mdash;Elinor, can he be justified? END
BEGIN NOW No, Marianne, in no possible way. END
BEGIN NOW And yet this woman&mdash;who knows what her art may have been?&mdash;how long it may have been premeditated, and how deeply contrived by her!&mdash;Who is she?&mdash;Who can she be?&mdash;Whom did I ever hear him talk of as young and attractive among his female acquaintance?&mdash;Oh! END
BEGIN NOW no one, no one&mdash;he talked to me only of myself. END
BEGIN NOW Another pause ensued; Marianne was greatly agitated, and it ended thus. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor, I must go home. END
BEGIN NOW I must go and comfort mama. END
BEGIN NOW Can not we be gone to-morrow? END
BEGIN NOW To-morrow, Marianne! END
BEGIN NOW Yes, why should I stay here? END
BEGIN NOW I came only for Willoughby's sake&mdash;and now who cares for me? END
BEGIN NOW Who regards me? END
BEGIN NOW It would be impossible to go to-morrow. END
BEGIN NOW We owe Mrs. Jennings much more than civility; and civility of the commonest kind must prevent such a hasty removal as that. END
BEGIN NOW Well then, another day or two, perhaps; but I cannot stay here long, I cannot stay to endure the questions and remarks of all these people. END
BEGIN NOW The Middletons and Palmers&mdash;how am I to bear their pity? END
BEGIN NOW The pity of such a woman as Lady Middleton! END
BEGIN NOW Oh, what would HE say to that! END
BEGIN NOW Elinor advised her to lie down again, and for a moment she did so; but no attitude could give her ease; and in restless pain of mind and body she moved from one posture to another, till growing more and more hysterical, her sister could with difficulty keep her on the bed at all, and for some time was fearful of being constrained to call for assistance. END
BEGIN NOW Some lavender drops, however, which she was at length persuaded to take, were of use; and from that time till Mrs. Jennings returned, she continued on the bed quiet and motionless. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Jennings came immediately to their room on her return, and without waiting to have her request of admittance answered, opened the door and walked in with a look of real concern. END
BEGIN NOW How do you do my dear? END
BEGIN NOW &mdash;said she in a voice of great compassion to Marianne, who turned away her face without attempting to answer. END
BEGIN NOW How is she, Miss Dashwood?&mdash;Poor thing! END
BEGIN NOW she looks very bad.&mdash; No wonder. END
BEGIN NOW Ay, it is but too true. END
BEGIN NOW He is to be married very soon&mdash;a good-for-nothing fellow! END
BEGIN NOW I have no patience with him. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Taylor told me of it half an hour ago, and she was told it by a particular friend of Miss Grey herself, else I am sure I should not have believed it; and I was almost ready to sink as it was. END
BEGIN NOW Well, said I, all I can say is, that if this be true, he has used a young lady of my acquaintance abominably ill, and I wish with all my soul his wife may plague his heart out. END
BEGIN NOW And so I shall always say, my dear, you may depend on it. END
BEGIN NOW I have no notion of men's going on in this way; and if ever I meet him again, I will give him such a dressing as he has not had this many a day. END
BEGIN NOW But there is one comfort, my dear Miss Marianne; he is not the only young man in the world worth having; and with your pretty face you will never want admirers. END
BEGIN NOW Well, poor thing! END
BEGIN NOW I won't disturb her any longer, for she had better have her cry out at once and have done with. END
BEGIN NOW The Parrys and Sandersons luckily are coming tonight you know, and that will amuse her. END
BEGIN NOW She then went away, walking on tiptoe out of the room, as if she supposed her young friend's affliction could be increased by noise. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne, to the surprise of her sister, determined on dining with them. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor even advised her against it. END
BEGIN NOW But no, she would go down; she could bear it very well, and the bustle about her would be less. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor, pleased to have her governed for a moment by such a motive, though believing it hardly possible that she could sit out the dinner, said no more; and adjusting her dress for her as well as she could, while Marianne still remained on the bed, was ready to assist her into the dining room as soon as they were summoned to it. END
BEGIN NOW When there, though looking most wretchedly, she ate more and was calmer than her sister had expected. END
BEGIN NOW Had she tried to speak, or had she been conscious of half Mrs. Jennings's well-meant but ill-judged attentions to her, this calmness could not have been maintained; but not a syllable escaped her lips; and the abstraction of her thoughts preserved her in ignorance of every thing that was passing before her. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor, who did justice to Mrs. Jennings's kindness, though its effusions were often distressing, and sometimes almost ridiculous, made her those acknowledgments, and returned her those civilities, which her sister could not make or return for herself. END
BEGIN NOW Their good friend saw that Marianne was unhappy, and felt that every thing was due to her which might make her at all less so. END
BEGIN NOW She treated her therefore, with all the indulgent fondness of a parent towards a favourite child on the last day of its holidays. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne was to have the best place by the fire, was to be tempted to eat by every delicacy in the house, and to be amused by the relation of all the news of the day. END
BEGIN NOW Had not Elinor, in the sad countenance of her sister, seen a check to all mirth, she could have been entertained by Mrs. Jennings's endeavours to cure a disappointment in love, by a variety of sweetmeats and olives, and a good fire. END
BEGIN NOW As soon, however, as the consciousness of all this was forced by continual repetition on Marianne, she could stay no longer. END
BEGIN NOW With a hasty exclamation of Misery, and a sign to her sister not to follow her, she directly got up and hurried out of the room. END
BEGIN NOW Poor soul! END
BEGIN NOW cried Mrs. Jennings, as soon as she was gone, how it grieves me to see her! END
BEGIN NOW And I declare if she is not gone away without finishing her wine! END
BEGIN NOW And the dried cherries too! END
BEGIN NOW Lord! END
BEGIN NOW nothing seems to do her any good. END
BEGIN NOW I am sure if I knew of any thing she would like, I would send all over the town for it. END
BEGIN NOW Well, it is the oddest thing to me, that a man should use such a pretty girl so ill! END
BEGIN NOW But when there is plenty of money on one side, and next to none on the other, Lord bless you! END
BEGIN NOW they care no more about such things!&mdash; The lady then&mdash;Miss Grey I think you called her&mdash;is very rich? END
BEGIN NOW Fifty thousand pounds, my dear. END
BEGIN NOW Did you ever see her? END
BEGIN NOW a smart, stylish girl they say, but not handsome. END
BEGIN NOW I remember her aunt very well, Biddy Henshawe; she married a very wealthy man. END
BEGIN NOW But the family are all rich together. END
BEGIN NOW Fifty thousand pounds! END
BEGIN NOW and by all accounts, it won't come before it's wanted; for they say he is all to pieces. END
BEGIN NOW No wonder! END
BEGIN NOW dashing about with his curricle and hunters! END
BEGIN NOW Well, it don't signify talking; but when a young man, be who he will, comes and makes love to a pretty girl, and promises marriage, he has no business to fly off from his word only because he grows poor, and a richer girl is ready to have him. END
BEGIN NOW Why don't he, in such a case, sell his horses, let his house, turn off his servants, and make a thorough reform at once? END
BEGIN NOW I warrant you, Miss Marianne would have been ready to wait till matters came round. END
BEGIN NOW But that won't do now-a-days; nothing in the way of pleasure can ever be given up by the young men of this age. END
BEGIN NOW Do you know what kind of a girl Miss Grey is? END
BEGIN NOW Is she said to be amiable? END
BEGIN NOW I never heard any harm of her; indeed I hardly ever heard her mentioned; except that Mrs. Taylor did say this morning, that one day Miss Walker hinted to her, that she believed Mr. and Mrs. Ellison would not be sorry to have Miss Grey married, for she and Mrs. Ellison could never agree. END
BEGIN NOW &mdash; And who are the Ellisons? END
BEGIN NOW Her guardians, my dear. END
BEGIN NOW But now she is of age and may choose for herself; and a pretty choice she has made!&mdash;What now, after pausing a moment&mdash; your poor sister is gone to her own room, I suppose, to moan by herself. END
BEGIN NOW Is there nothing one can get to comfort her? END
BEGIN NOW Poor dear, it seems quite cruel to let her be alone. END
BEGIN NOW Well, by-and-by we shall have a few friends, and that will amuse her a little. END
BEGIN NOW What shall we play at? END
BEGIN NOW She hates whist I know; but is there no round game she cares for? END
BEGIN NOW Dear ma'am, this kindness is quite unnecessary. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne, I dare say, will not leave her room again this evening. END
BEGIN NOW I shall persuade her if I can to go early to bed, for I am sure she wants rest. END
BEGIN NOW Aye, I believe that will be best for her. END
BEGIN NOW Let her name her own supper, and go to bed. END
BEGIN NOW Lord! END
BEGIN NOW no wonder she has been looking so bad and so cast down this last week or two, for this matter I suppose has been hanging over her head as long as that. END
BEGIN NOW And so the letter that came today finished it! END
BEGIN NOW Poor soul! END
BEGIN NOW I am sure if I had had a notion of it, I would not have joked her about it for all my money. END
BEGIN NOW But then you know, how should I guess such a thing? END
BEGIN NOW I made sure of its being nothing but a common love letter, and you know young people like to be laughed at about them. END
BEGIN NOW Lord! END
BEGIN NOW how concerned Sir John and my daughters will be when they hear it! END
BEGIN NOW If I had my senses about me I might have called in Conduit Street in my way home, and told them of it. END
BEGIN NOW But I shall see them tomorrow. END
BEGIN NOW It would be unnecessary I am sure, for you to caution Mrs. Palmer and Sir John against ever naming Mr. Willoughby, or making the slightest allusion to what has passed, before my sister. END
BEGIN NOW Their own good-nature must point out to them the real cruelty of appearing to know any thing about it when she is present; and the less that may ever be said to myself on the subject, the more my feelings will be spared, as you my dear madam will easily believe. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW Lord! END
BEGIN NOW yes, that I do indeed. END
BEGIN NOW It must be terrible for you to hear it talked of; and as for your sister, I am sure I would not mention a word about it to her for the world. END
BEGIN NOW You saw I did not all dinner time. END
BEGIN NOW No more would Sir John, nor my daughters, for they are all very thoughtful and considerate; especially if I give them a hint, as I certainly will. END
BEGIN NOW For my part, I think the less that is said about such things, the better, the sooner 'tis blown over and forgot. END
BEGIN NOW And what does talking ever do you know? END
BEGIN NOW In this affair it can only do harm; more so perhaps than in many cases of a similar kind, for it has been attended by circumstances which, for the sake of every one concerned in it, make it unfit to become the public conversation. END
BEGIN NOW I must do THIS justice to Mr. Willoughby&mdash;he has broken no positive engagement with my sister. END
BEGIN NOW Law, my dear! END
BEGIN NOW Don't pretend to defend him. END
BEGIN NOW No positive engagement indeed! END
BEGIN NOW after taking her all over Allenham House, and fixing on the very rooms they were to live in hereafter! END
BEGIN NOW Elinor, for her sister's sake, could not press the subject farther, and she hoped it was not required of her for Willoughby's; since, though Marianne might lose much, he could gain very little by the enforcement of the real truth. END
BEGIN NOW After a short silence on both sides, Mrs. Jennings, with all her natural hilarity, burst forth again. END
BEGIN NOW Well, my dear, 'tis a true saying about an ill-wind, for it will be all the better for Colonel Brandon. END
BEGIN NOW He will have her at last; aye, that he will. END
BEGIN NOW Mind me, now, if they an't married by Mid-summer. END
BEGIN NOW Lord! END
BEGIN NOW how he'll chuckle over this news! END
BEGIN NOW I hope he will come tonight. END
BEGIN NOW It will be all to one a better match for your sister. END
BEGIN NOW Two thousand a year without debt or drawback&mdash;except the little love-child, indeed; aye, I had forgot her; but she may be 'prenticed out at a small cost, and then what does it signify? END
BEGIN NOW Delaford is a nice place, I can tell you; exactly what I call a nice old fashioned place, full of comforts and conveniences; quite shut in with great garden walls that are covered with the best fruit-trees in the country; and such a mulberry tree in one corner! END
BEGIN NOW Lord! END
BEGIN NOW how Charlotte and I did stuff the only time we were there! END
BEGIN NOW Then, there is a dove-cote, some delightful stew-ponds, and a very pretty canal; and every thing, in short, that one could wish for; and, moreover, it is close to the church, and only a quarter of a mile from the turnpike-road, so 'tis never dull, for if you only go and sit up in an old yew arbour behind the house, you may see all the carriages that pass along. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW 'tis a nice place! END
BEGIN NOW A butcher hard by in the village, and the parsonage-house within a stone's throw. END
BEGIN NOW To my fancy, a thousand times prettier than Barton Park, where they are forced to send three miles for their meat, and have not a neighbour nearer than your mother. END
BEGIN NOW Well, I shall spirit up the Colonel as soon as I can. END
BEGIN NOW One shoulder of mutton, you know, drives another down. END
BEGIN NOW If we CAN but put Willoughby out of her head! END
BEGIN NOW Ay, if we can do THAT, Ma'am, said Elinor, we shall do very well with or without Colonel Brandon. END
BEGIN NOW And then rising, she went away to join Marianne, whom she found, as she expected, in her own room, leaning, in silent misery, over the small remains of a fire, which, till Elinor's entrance, had been her only light. END
BEGIN NOW You had better leave me, was all the notice that her sister received from her. END
BEGIN NOW I will leave you, said Elinor, if you will go to bed. END
BEGIN NOW But this, from the momentary perverseness of impatient suffering, she at first refused to do. END
BEGIN NOW Her sister's earnest, though gentle persuasion, however, soon softened her to compliance, and Elinor saw her lay her aching head on the pillow, and as she hoped, in a way to get some quiet rest before she left her. END
BEGIN NOW In the drawing-room, whither she then repaired, she was soon joined by Mrs. Jennings, with a wine-glass, full of something, in her hand. END
BEGIN NOW My dear, said she, entering, I have just recollected that I have some of the finest old Constantia wine in the house that ever was tasted, so I have brought a glass of it for your sister. END
BEGIN NOW My poor husband! END
BEGIN NOW how fond he was of it! END
BEGIN NOW Whenever he had a touch of his old colicky gout, he said it did him more good than any thing else in the world. END
BEGIN NOW Do take it to your sister. END
BEGIN NOW Dear Ma'am, replied Elinor, smiling at the difference of the complaints for which it was recommended, how good you are! END
BEGIN NOW But I have just left Marianne in bed, and, I hope, almost asleep; and as I think nothing will be of so much service to her as rest, if you will give me leave, I will drink the wine myself. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Jennings, though regretting that she had not been five minutes earlier, was satisfied with the compromise; and Elinor, as she swallowed the chief of it, reflected, that though its effects on a colicky gout were, at present, of little importance to her, its healing powers, on a disappointed heart might be as reasonably tried on herself as on her sister. END
BEGIN NOW Colonel Brandon came in while the party were at tea, and by his manner of looking round the room for Marianne, Elinor immediately fancied that he neither expected nor wished to see her there, and, in short, that he was already aware of what occasioned her absence. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Jennings was not struck by the same thought; for soon after his entrance, she walked across the room to the tea-table where Elinor presided, and whispered&mdash; The Colonel looks as grave as ever you see. END
BEGIN NOW He knows nothing of it; do tell him, my dear. END
BEGIN NOW He shortly afterwards drew a chair close to hers, and, with a look which perfectly assured her of his good information, inquired after her sister. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne is not well, said she. END
BEGIN NOW She has been indisposed all day, and we have persuaded her to go to bed. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps, then, he hesitatingly replied, what I heard this morning may be&mdash;there may be more truth in it than I could believe possible at first. END
BEGIN NOW What did you hear? END
BEGIN NOW That a gentleman, whom I had reason to think&mdash;in short, that a man, whom I KNEW to be engaged&mdash;but how shall I tell you? END
BEGIN NOW If you know it already, as surely you must, I may be spared. END
BEGIN NOW You mean, answered Elinor, with forced calmness, Mr. Willoughby's marriage with Miss Grey. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, we DO know it all. END
BEGIN NOW This seems to have been a day of general elucidation, for this very morning first unfolded it to us. END
BEGIN NOW Mr. Willoughby is unfathomable! END
BEGIN NOW Where did you hear it? END
BEGIN NOW In a stationer's shop in Pall Mall, where I had business. END
BEGIN NOW Two ladies were waiting for their carriage, and one of them was giving the other an account of the intended match, in a voice so little attempting concealment, that it was impossible for me not to hear all. END
BEGIN NOW The name of Willoughby, John Willoughby, frequently repeated, first caught my attention; and what followed was a positive assertion that every thing was now finally settled respecting his marriage with Miss Grey&mdash;it was no longer to be a secret&mdash;it would take place even within a few weeks, with many particulars of preparations and other matters. END
BEGIN NOW One thing, especially, I remember, because it served to identify the man still more:&mdash;as soon as the ceremony was over, they were to go to Combe Magna, his seat in Somersetshire. END
BEGIN NOW My astonishment!&mdash;but it would be impossible to describe what I felt. END
BEGIN NOW The communicative lady I learnt, on inquiry, for I stayed in the shop till they were gone, was a Mrs. Ellison, and that, as I have been since informed, is the name of Miss Grey's guardian. END
BEGIN NOW It is. END
BEGIN NOW But have you likewise heard that Miss Grey has fifty thousand pounds? END
BEGIN NOW In that, if in any thing, we may find an explanation. END
BEGIN NOW It may be so; but Willoughby is capable&mdash;at least I think &mdash;he stopped a moment; then added in a voice which seemed to distrust itself, And your sister&mdash;how did she&mdash; Her sufferings have been very severe. END
BEGIN NOW I have only to hope that they may be proportionately short. END
BEGIN NOW It has been, it is a most cruel affliction. END
BEGIN NOW Till yesterday, I believe, she never doubted his regard; and even now, perhaps&mdash;but I am almost convinced that he never was really attached to her. END
BEGIN NOW He has been very deceitful! END
BEGIN NOW and, in some points, there seems a hardness of heart about him. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW said Colonel Brandon, there is, indeed! END
BEGIN NOW But your sister does not&mdash;I think you said so&mdash;she does not consider quite as you do? END
BEGIN NOW You know her disposition, and may believe how eagerly she would still justify him if she could. END
BEGIN NOW He made no answer; and soon afterwards, by the removal of the tea-things, and the arrangement of the card parties, the subject was necessarily dropped. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Jennings, who had watched them with pleasure while they were talking, and who expected to see the effect of Miss Dashwood's communication, in such an instantaneous gaiety on Colonel Brandon's side, as might have become a man in the bloom of youth, of hope and happiness, saw him, with amazement, remain the whole evening more serious and thoughtful than usual. END
BEGIN NOW From a night of more sleep than she had expected, Marianne awoke the next morning to the same consciousness of misery in which she had closed her eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor encouraged her as much as possible to talk of what she felt; and before breakfast was ready, they had gone through the subject again and again; and with the same steady conviction and affectionate counsel on Elinor's side, the same impetuous feelings and varying opinions on Marianne's, as before. END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes she could believe Willoughby to be as unfortunate and as innocent as herself, and at others, lost every consolation in the impossibility of acquitting him. END
BEGIN NOW At one moment she was absolutely indifferent to the observation of all the world, at another she would seclude herself from it for ever, and at a third could resist it with energy. END
BEGIN NOW In one thing, however, she was uniform, when it came to the point, in avoiding, where it was possible, the presence of Mrs. Jennings, and in a determined silence when obliged to endure it. END
BEGIN NOW Her heart was hardened against the belief of Mrs. Jennings's entering into her sorrows with any compassion. END
BEGIN NOW No, no, no, it cannot be, she cried; she cannot feel. END
BEGIN NOW Her kindness is not sympathy; her good-nature is not tenderness. END
BEGIN NOW All that she wants is gossip, and she only likes me now because I supply it. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor had not needed this to be assured of the injustice to which her sister was often led in her opinion of others, by the irritable refinement of her own mind, and the too great importance placed by her on the delicacies of a strong sensibility, and the graces of a polished manner. END
BEGIN NOW Like half the rest of the world, if more than half there be that are clever and good, Marianne, with excellent abilities and an excellent disposition, was neither reasonable nor candid. END
BEGIN NOW She expected from other people the same opinions and feelings as her own, and she judged of their motives by the immediate effect of their actions on herself. END
BEGIN NOW Thus a circumstance occurred, while the sisters were together in their own room after breakfast, which sunk the heart of Mrs. Jennings still lower in her estimation; because, through her own weakness, it chanced to prove a source of fresh pain to herself, though Mrs. Jennings was governed in it by an impulse of the utmost goodwill. END
BEGIN NOW With a letter in her outstretched hand, and countenance gaily smiling, from the persuasion of bringing comfort, she entered their room, saying, Now, my dear, I bring you something that I am sure will do you good. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne heard enough. END
BEGIN NOW In one moment her imagination placed before her a letter from Willoughby, full of tenderness and contrition, explanatory of all that had passed, satisfactory, convincing; and instantly followed by Willoughby himself, rushing eagerly into the room to inforce, at her feet, by the eloquence of his eyes, the assurances of his letter. END
BEGIN NOW The work of one moment was destroyed by the next. END
BEGIN NOW The hand writing of her mother, never till then unwelcome, was before her; and, in the acuteness of the disappointment which followed such an ecstasy of more than hope, she felt as if, till that instant, she had never suffered. END
BEGIN NOW The cruelty of Mrs. Jennings no language, within her reach in her moments of happiest eloquence, could have expressed; and now she could reproach her only by the tears which streamed from her eyes with passionate violence&mdash;a reproach, however, so entirely lost on its object, that after many expressions of pity, she withdrew, still referring her to the letter of comfort. END
BEGIN NOW But the letter, when she was calm enough to read it, brought little comfort. END
BEGIN NOW Willoughby filled every page. END
BEGIN NOW Her mother, still confident of their engagement, and relying as warmly as ever on his constancy, had only been roused by Elinor's application, to intreat from Marianne greater openness towards them both; and this, with such tenderness towards her, such affection for Willoughby, and such a conviction of their future happiness in each other, that she wept with agony through the whole of it. END
BEGIN NOW All her impatience to be at home again now returned; her mother was dearer to her than ever; dearer through the very excess of her mistaken confidence in Willoughby, and she was wildly urgent to be gone. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor, unable herself to determine whether it were better for Marianne to be in London or at Barton, offered no counsel of her own except of patience till their mother's wishes could be known; and at length she obtained her sister's consent to wait for that knowledge. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Jennings left them earlier than usual; for she could not be easy till the Middletons and Palmers were able to grieve as much as herself; and positively refusing Elinor's offered attendance, went out alone for the rest of the morning. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor, with a very heavy heart, aware of the pain she was going to communicate, and perceiving, by Marianne's letter, how ill she had succeeded in laying any foundation for it, then sat down to write her mother an account of what had passed, and entreat her directions for the future; while Marianne, who came into the drawing-room on Mrs. Jennings's going away, remained fixed at the table where Elinor wrote, watching the advancement of her pen, grieving over her for the hardship of such a task, and grieving still more fondly over its effect on her mother. END
BEGIN NOW In this manner they had continued about a quarter of an hour, when Marianne, whose nerves could not then bear any sudden noise, was startled by a rap at the door. END
BEGIN NOW Who can this be? END
BEGIN NOW cried Elinor. END
BEGIN NOW So early too! END
BEGIN NOW I thought we HAD been safe. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne moved to the window&mdash; It is Colonel Brandon! END
BEGIN NOW said she, with vexation. END
BEGIN NOW We are never safe from HIM. END
BEGIN NOW He will not come in, as Mrs. Jennings is from home. END
BEGIN NOW I will not trust to THAT, retreating to her own room. END
BEGIN NOW A man who has nothing to do with his own time has no conscience in his intrusion on that of others. END
BEGIN NOW The event proved her conjecture right, though it was founded on injustice and error; for Colonel Brandon DID come in; and Elinor, who was convinced that solicitude for Marianne brought him thither, and who saw THAT solicitude in his disturbed and melancholy look, and in his anxious though brief inquiry after her, could not forgive her sister for esteeming him so lightly. END
BEGIN NOW I met Mrs. Jennings in Bond Street, said he, after the first salutation, and she encouraged me to come on; and I was the more easily encouraged, because I thought it probable that I might find you alone, which I was very desirous of doing. END
BEGIN NOW My object&mdash;my wish&mdash;my sole wish in desiring it&mdash;I hope, I believe it is&mdash;is to be a means of giving comfort;&mdash;no, I must not say comfort&mdash;not present comfort&mdash;but conviction, lasting conviction to your sister's mind. END
BEGIN NOW My regard for her, for yourself, for your mother&mdash;will you allow me to prove it, by relating some circumstances which nothing but a VERY sincere regard&mdash;nothing but an earnest desire of being useful&mdash;I think I am justified&mdash;though where so many hours have been spent in convincing myself that I am right, is there not some reason to fear I may be wrong? END
BEGIN NOW He stopped. END
BEGIN NOW I understand you, said Elinor. END
BEGIN NOW You have something to tell me of Mr. Willoughby, that will open his character farther. END
BEGIN NOW Your telling it will be the greatest act of friendship that can be shewn Marianne. END
BEGIN NOW MY gratitude will be insured immediately by any information tending to that end, and HERS must be gained by it in time. END
BEGIN NOW Pray, pray let me hear it. END
BEGIN NOW You shall; and, to be brief, when I quitted Barton last October,&mdash;but this will give you no idea&mdash;I must go farther back. END
BEGIN NOW You will find me a very awkward narrator, Miss Dashwood; I hardly know where to begin. END
BEGIN NOW A short account of myself, I believe, will be necessary, and it SHALL be a short one. END
BEGIN NOW On such a subject, sighing heavily, can I have little temptation to be diffuse. END
BEGIN NOW He stopt a moment for recollection, and then, with another sigh, went on. END
BEGIN NOW You have probably entirely forgotten a conversation&mdash;(it is not to be supposed that it could make any impression on you)&mdash;a conversation between us one evening at Barton Park&mdash;it was the evening of a dance&mdash;in which I alluded to a lady I had once known, as resembling, in some measure, your sister Marianne. END
BEGIN NOW Indeed, answered Elinor, I have NOT forgotten it. END
BEGIN NOW He looked pleased by this remembrance, and added, If I am not deceived by the uncertainty, the partiality of tender recollection, there is a very strong resemblance between them, as well in mind as person. END
BEGIN NOW The same warmth of heart, the same eagerness of fancy and spirits. END
BEGIN NOW This lady was one of my nearest relations, an orphan from her infancy, and under the guardianship of my father. END
BEGIN NOW Our ages were nearly the same, and from our earliest years we were playfellows and friends. END
BEGIN NOW I cannot remember the time when I did not love Eliza; and my affection for her, as we grew up, was such, as perhaps, judging from my present forlorn and cheerless gravity, you might think me incapable of having ever felt. END
BEGIN NOW Hers, for me, was, I believe, fervent as the attachment of your sister to Mr. Willoughby and it was, though from a different cause, no less unfortunate. END
BEGIN NOW At seventeen she was lost to me for ever. END
BEGIN NOW She was married&mdash;married against her inclination to my brother. END
BEGIN NOW Her fortune was large, and our family estate much encumbered. END
BEGIN NOW And this, I fear, is all that can be said for the conduct of one, who was at once her uncle and guardian. END
BEGIN NOW My brother did not deserve her; he did not even love her. END
BEGIN NOW I had hoped that her regard for me would support her under any difficulty, and for some time it did; but at last the misery of her situation, for she experienced great unkindness, overcame all her resolution, and though she had promised me that nothing&mdash;but how blindly I relate! END
BEGIN NOW I have never told you how this was brought on. END
BEGIN NOW We were within a few hours of eloping together for Scotland. END
BEGIN NOW The treachery, or the folly, of my cousin's maid betrayed us. END
BEGIN NOW I was banished to the house of a relation far distant, and she was allowed no liberty, no society, no amusement, till my father's point was gained. END
BEGIN NOW I had depended on her fortitude too far, and the blow was a severe one&mdash;but had her marriage been happy, so young as I then was, a few months must have reconciled me to it, or at least I should not have now to lament it. END
BEGIN NOW This however was not the case. END
BEGIN NOW My brother had no regard for her; his pleasures were not what they ought to have been, and from the first he treated her unkindly. END
BEGIN NOW The consequence of this, upon a mind so young, so lively, so inexperienced as Mrs. Brandon's, was but too natural. END
BEGIN NOW She resigned herself at first to all the misery of her situation; and happy had it been if she had not lived to overcome those regrets which the remembrance of me occasioned. END
BEGIN NOW But can we wonder that, with such a husband to provoke inconstancy, and without a friend to advise or restrain her (for my father lived only a few months after their marriage, and I was with my regiment in the East Indies) she should fall? END
BEGIN NOW Had I remained in England, perhaps&mdash;but I meant to promote the happiness of both by removing from her for years, and for that purpose had procured my exchange. END
BEGIN NOW The shock which her marriage had given me, he continued, in a voice of great agitation, was of trifling weight&mdash;was nothing to what I felt when I heard, about two years afterwards, of her divorce. END
BEGIN NOW It was THAT which threw this gloom,&mdash;even now the recollection of what I suffered&mdash; He could say no more, and rising hastily walked for a few minutes about the room. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor, affected by his relation, and still more by his distress, could not speak. END
BEGIN NOW He saw her concern, and coming to her, took her hand, pressed it, and kissed it with grateful respect. END
BEGIN NOW A few minutes more of silent exertion enabled him to proceed with composure. END
BEGIN NOW It was nearly three years after this unhappy period before I returned to England. END
BEGIN NOW My first care, when I DID arrive, was of course to seek for her; but the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy. END
BEGIN NOW I could not trace her beyond her first seducer, and there was every reason to fear that she had removed from him only to sink deeper in a life of sin. END
BEGIN NOW Her legal allowance was not adequate to her fortune, nor sufficient for her comfortable maintenance, and I learnt from my brother that the power of receiving it had been made over some months before to another person. END
BEGIN NOW He imagined, and calmly could he imagine it, that her extravagance, and consequent distress, had obliged her to dispose of it for some immediate relief. END
BEGIN NOW At last, however, and after I had been six months in England, I DID find her. END
BEGIN NOW Regard for a former servant of my own, who had since fallen into misfortune, carried me to visit him in a spunging-house, where he was confined for debt; and there, in the same house, under a similar confinement, was my unfortunate sister. END
BEGIN NOW So altered&mdash;so faded&mdash;worn down by acute suffering of every kind! END
BEGIN NOW hardly could I believe the melancholy and sickly figure before me, to be the remains of the lovely, blooming, healthful girl, on whom I had once doted. END
BEGIN NOW What I endured in so beholding her&mdash;but I have no right to wound your feelings by attempting to describe it&mdash;I have pained you too much already. END
BEGIN NOW That she was, to all appearance, in the last stage of a consumption, was&mdash;yes, in such a situation it was my greatest comfort. END
BEGIN NOW Life could do nothing for her, beyond giving time for a better preparation for death; and that was given. END
BEGIN NOW I saw her placed in comfortable lodgings, and under proper attendants; I visited her every day during the rest of her short life: I was with her in her last moments. END
BEGIN NOW Again he stopped to recover himself; and Elinor spoke her feelings in an exclamation of tender concern, at the fate of his unfortunate friend. END
BEGIN NOW Your sister, I hope, cannot be offended, said he, by the resemblance I have fancied between her and my poor disgraced relation. END
BEGIN NOW Their fates, their fortunes, cannot be the same; and had the natural sweet disposition of the one been guarded by a firmer mind, or a happier marriage, she might have been all that you will live to see the other be. END
BEGIN NOW But to what does all this lead? END
BEGIN NOW I seem to have been distressing you for nothing. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW Miss Dashwood&mdash;a subject such as this&mdash;untouched for fourteen years&mdash;it is dangerous to handle it at all! END
BEGIN NOW I WILL be more collected&mdash;more concise. END
BEGIN NOW She left to my care her only child, a little girl, the offspring of her first guilty connection, who was then about three years old. END
BEGIN NOW She loved the child, and had always kept it with her. END
BEGIN NOW It was a valued, a precious trust to me; and gladly would I have discharged it in the strictest sense, by watching over her education myself, had the nature of our situations allowed it; but I had no family, no home; and my little Eliza was therefore placed at school. END
BEGIN NOW I saw her there whenever I could, and after the death of my brother, (which happened about five years ago, and which left to me the possession of the family property,) she visited me at Delaford. END
BEGIN NOW I called her a distant relation; but I am well aware that I have in general been suspected of a much nearer connection with her. END
BEGIN NOW It is now three years ago (she had just reached her fourteenth year,) that I removed her from school, to place her under the care of a very respectable woman, residing in Dorsetshire, who had the charge of four or five other girls of about the same time of life; and for two years I had every reason to be pleased with her situation. END
BEGIN NOW But last February, almost a twelvemonth back, she suddenly disappeared. END
BEGIN NOW I had allowed her, (imprudently, as it has since turned out,) at her earnest desire, to go to Bath with one of her young friends, who was attending her father there for his health. END
BEGIN NOW I knew him to be a very good sort of man, and I thought well of his daughter&mdash;better than she deserved, for, with a most obstinate and ill-judged secrecy, she would tell nothing, would give no clue, though she certainly knew all. END
BEGIN NOW He, her father, a well-meaning, but not a quick-sighted man, could really, I believe, give no information; for he had been generally confined to the house, while the girls were ranging over the town and making what acquaintance they chose; and he tried to convince me, as thoroughly as he was convinced himself, of his daughter's being entirely unconcerned in the business. END
BEGIN NOW In short, I could learn nothing but that she was gone; all the rest, for eight long months, was left to conjecture. END
BEGIN NOW What I thought, what I feared, may be imagined; and what I suffered too. END
BEGIN NOW Good heavens! END
BEGIN NOW cried Elinor, could it be&mdash;could Willoughby! END
BEGIN NOW &mdash; The first news that reached me of her, he continued, came in a letter from herself, last October. END
BEGIN NOW It was forwarded to me from Delaford, and I received it on the very morning of our intended party to Whitwell; and this was the reason of my leaving Barton so suddenly, which I am sure must at the time have appeared strange to every body, and which I believe gave offence to some. END
BEGIN NOW Little did Mr. Willoughby imagine, I suppose, when his looks censured me for incivility in breaking up the party, that I was called away to the relief of one whom he had made poor and miserable; but HAD he known it, what would it have availed? END
BEGIN NOW Would he have been less gay or less happy in the smiles of your sister? END
BEGIN NOW No, he had already done that, which no man who CAN feel for another would do. END
BEGIN NOW He had left the girl whose youth and innocence he had seduced, in a situation of the utmost distress, with no creditable home, no help, no friends, ignorant of his address! END
BEGIN NOW He had left her, promising to return; he neither returned, nor wrote, nor relieved her. END
BEGIN NOW This is beyond every thing! END
BEGIN NOW exclaimed Elinor. END
BEGIN NOW His character is now before you; expensive, dissipated, and worse than both. END
BEGIN NOW Knowing all this, as I have now known it many weeks, guess what I must have felt on seeing your sister as fond of him as ever, and on being assured that she was to marry him: guess what I must have felt for all your sakes. END
BEGIN NOW When I came to you last week and found you alone, I came determined to know the truth; though irresolute what to do when it WAS known. END
BEGIN NOW My behaviour must have seemed strange to you then; but now you will comprehend it. END
BEGIN NOW To suffer you all to be so deceived; to see your sister&mdash;but what could I do? END
BEGIN NOW I had no hope of interfering with success; and sometimes I thought your sister's influence might yet reclaim him. END
BEGIN NOW But now, after such dishonorable usage, who can tell what were his designs on her. END
BEGIN NOW Whatever they may have been, however, she may now, and hereafter doubtless WILL turn with gratitude towards her own condition, when she compares it with that of my poor Eliza, when she considers the wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl, and pictures her to herself, with an affection for him so strong, still as strong as her own, and with a mind tormented by self-reproach, which must attend her through life. END
BEGIN NOW Surely this comparison must have its use with her. END
BEGIN NOW She will feel her own sufferings to be nothing. END
BEGIN NOW They proceed from no misconduct, and can bring no disgrace. END
BEGIN NOW On the contrary, every friend must be made still more her friend by them. END
BEGIN NOW Concern for her unhappiness, and respect for her fortitude under it, must strengthen every attachment. END
BEGIN NOW Use your own discretion, however, in communicating to her what I have told you. END
BEGIN NOW You must know best what will be its effect; but had I not seriously, and from my heart believed it might be of service, might lessen her regrets, I would not have suffered myself to trouble you with this account of my family afflictions, with a recital which may seem to have been intended to raise myself at the expense of others. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor's thanks followed this speech with grateful earnestness; attended too with the assurance of her expecting material advantage to Marianne, from the communication of what had passed. END
BEGIN NOW I have been more pained, said she, by her endeavors to acquit him than by all the rest; for it irritates her mind more than the most perfect conviction of his unworthiness can do. END
BEGIN NOW Now, though at first she will suffer much, I am sure she will soon become easier. END
BEGIN NOW Have you, she continued, after a short silence, ever seen Mr. Willoughby since you left him at Barton? END
BEGIN NOW Yes, he replied gravely, once I have. END
BEGIN NOW One meeting was unavoidable. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor, startled by his manner, looked at him anxiously, saying, What? END
BEGIN NOW have you met him to&mdash; I could meet him no other way. END
BEGIN NOW Eliza had confessed to me, though most reluctantly, the name of her lover; and when he returned to town, which was within a fortnight after myself, we met by appointment, he to defend, I to punish his conduct. END
BEGIN NOW We returned unwounded, and the meeting, therefore, never got abroad. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor sighed over the fancied necessity of this; but to a man and a soldier she presumed not to censure it. END
BEGIN NOW Such, said Colonel Brandon, after a pause, has been the unhappy resemblance between the fate of mother and daughter! END
BEGIN NOW and so imperfectly have I discharged my trust! END
BEGIN NOW Is she still in town? END
BEGIN NOW No; as soon as she recovered from her lying-in, for I found her near her delivery, I removed her and her child into the country, and there she remains. END
BEGIN NOW Recollecting, soon afterwards, that he was probably dividing Elinor from her sister, he put an end to his visit, receiving from her again the same grateful acknowledgments, and leaving her full of compassion and esteem for him. END
BEGIN NOW When the particulars of this conversation were repeated by Miss Dashwood to her sister, as they very soon were, the effect on her was not entirely such as the former had hoped to see. END
BEGIN NOW Not that Marianne appeared to distrust the truth of any part of it, for she listened to it all with the most steady and submissive attention, made neither objection nor remark, attempted no vindication of Willoughby, and seemed to shew by her tears that she felt it to be impossible. END
BEGIN NOW But though this behaviour assured Elinor that the conviction of this guilt WAS carried home to her mind, though she saw with satisfaction the effect of it, in her no longer avoiding Colonel Brandon when he called, in her speaking to him, even voluntarily speaking, with a kind of compassionate respect, and though she saw her spirits less violently irritated than before, she did not see her less wretched. END
BEGIN NOW Her mind did become settled, but it was settled in a gloomy dejection. END
BEGIN NOW She felt the loss of Willoughby's character yet more heavily than she had felt the loss of his heart; his seduction and desertion of Miss Williams, the misery of that poor girl, and the doubt of what his designs might ONCE have been on herself, preyed altogether so much on her spirits, that she could not bring herself to speak of what she felt even to Elinor; and, brooding over her sorrows in silence, gave more pain to her sister than could have been communicated by the most open and most frequent confession of them. END
BEGIN NOW To give the feelings or the language of Mrs. Dashwood on receiving and answering Elinor's letter would be only to give a repetition of what her daughters had already felt and said; of a disappointment hardly less painful than Marianne's, and an indignation even greater than Elinor's. END
BEGIN NOW Long letters from her, quickly succeeding each other, arrived to tell all that she suffered and thought; to express her anxious solicitude for Marianne, and entreat she would bear up with fortitude under this misfortune. END
BEGIN NOW Bad indeed must the nature of Marianne's affliction be, when her mother could talk of fortitude! END
BEGIN NOW mortifying and humiliating must be the origin of those regrets, which SHE could wish her not to indulge! END
BEGIN NOW Against the interest of her own individual comfort, Mrs. Dashwood had determined that it would be better for Marianne to be any where, at that time, than at Barton, where every thing within her view would be bringing back the past in the strongest and most afflicting manner, by constantly placing Willoughby before her, such as she had always seen him there. END
BEGIN NOW She recommended it to her daughters, therefore, by all means not to shorten their visit to Mrs. Jennings; the length of which, though never exactly fixed, had been expected by all to comprise at least five or six weeks. END
BEGIN NOW A variety of occupations, of objects, and of company, which could not be procured at Barton, would be inevitable there, and might yet, she hoped, cheat Marianne, at times, into some interest beyond herself, and even into some amusement, much as the ideas of both might now be spurned by her. END
BEGIN NOW From all danger of seeing Willoughby again, her mother considered her to be at least equally safe in town as in the country, since his acquaintance must now be dropped by all who called themselves her friends. END
BEGIN NOW Design could never bring them in each other's way: negligence could never leave them exposed to a surprise; and chance had less in its favour in the crowd of London than even in the retirement of Barton, where it might force him before her while paying that visit at Allenham on his marriage, which Mrs. Dashwood, from foreseeing at first as a probable event, had brought herself to expect as a certain one. END
BEGIN NOW She had yet another reason for wishing her children to remain where they were; a letter from her son-in-law had told her that he and his wife were to be in town before the middle of February, and she judged it right that they should sometimes see their brother. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne had promised to be guided by her mother's opinion, and she submitted to it therefore without opposition, though it proved perfectly different from what she wished and expected, though she felt it to be entirely wrong, formed on mistaken grounds, and that by requiring her longer continuance in London it deprived her of the only possible alleviation of her wretchedness, the personal sympathy of her mother, and doomed her to such society and such scenes as must prevent her ever knowing a moment's rest. END
BEGIN NOW But it was a matter of great consolation to her, that what brought evil to herself would bring good to her sister; and Elinor, on the other hand, suspecting that it would not be in her power to avoid Edward entirely, comforted herself by thinking, that though their longer stay would therefore militate against her own happiness, it would be better for Marianne than an immediate return into Devonshire. END
BEGIN NOW Her carefulness in guarding her sister from ever hearing Willoughby's name mentioned, was not thrown away. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne, though without knowing it herself, reaped all its advantage; for neither Mrs. Jennings, nor Sir John, nor even Mrs. Palmer herself, ever spoke of him before her. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor wished that the same forbearance could have extended towards herself, but that was impossible, and she was obliged to listen day after day to the indignation of them all. END
BEGIN NOW Sir John, could not have thought it possible. END
BEGIN NOW A man of whom he had always had such reason to think well! END
BEGIN NOW Such a good-natured fellow! END
BEGIN NOW He did not believe there was a bolder rider in England! END
BEGIN NOW It was an unaccountable business. END
BEGIN NOW He wished him at the devil with all his heart. END
BEGIN NOW He would not speak another word to him, meet him where he might, for all the world! END
BEGIN NOW No, not if it were to be by the side of Barton covert, and they were kept watching for two hours together. END
BEGIN NOW Such a scoundrel of a fellow! END
BEGIN NOW such a deceitful dog! END
BEGIN NOW It was only the last time they met that he had offered him one of Folly's puppies! END
BEGIN NOW and this was the end of it! END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Palmer, in her way, was equally angry. END
BEGIN NOW She was determined to drop his acquaintance immediately, and she was very thankful that she had never been acquainted with him at all. END
BEGIN NOW She wished with all her heart Combe Magna was not so near Cleveland; but it did not signify, for it was a great deal too far off to visit; she hated him so much that she was resolved never to mention his name again, and she should tell everybody she saw, how good-for-nothing he was. END
BEGIN NOW The rest of Mrs. Palmer's sympathy was shewn in procuring all the particulars in her power of the approaching marriage, and communicating them to Elinor. END
BEGIN NOW She could soon tell at what coachmaker's the new carriage was building, by what painter Mr. Willoughby's portrait was drawn, and at what warehouse Miss Grey's clothes might be seen. END
BEGIN NOW The calm and polite unconcern of Lady Middleton on the occasion was a happy relief to Elinor's spirits, oppressed as they often were by the clamorous kindness of the others. END
BEGIN NOW It was a great comfort to her to be sure of exciting no interest in ONE person at least among their circle of friends: a great comfort to know that there was ONE who would meet her without feeling any curiosity after particulars, or any anxiety for her sister's health. END
BEGIN NOW Every qualification is raised at times, by the circumstances of the moment, to more than its real value; and she was sometimes worried down by officious condolence to rate good-breeding as more indispensable to comfort than good-nature. END
BEGIN NOW Lady Middleton expressed her sense of the affair about once every day, or twice, if the subject occurred very often, by saying, It is very shocking, indeed! END
BEGIN NOW and by the means of this continual though gentle vent, was able not only to see the Miss Dashwoods from the first without the smallest emotion, but very soon to see them without recollecting a word of the matter; and having thus supported the dignity of her own sex, and spoken her decided censure of what was wrong in the other, she thought herself at liberty to attend to the interest of her own assemblies, and therefore determined (though rather against the opinion of Sir John) that as Mrs. Willoughby would at once be a woman of elegance and fortune, to leave her card with her as soon as she married. END
BEGIN NOW Colonel Brandon's delicate, unobtrusive enquiries were never unwelcome to Miss Dashwood. END
BEGIN NOW He had abundantly earned the privilege of intimate discussion of her sister's disappointment, by the friendly zeal with which he had endeavoured to soften it, and they always conversed with confidence. END
BEGIN NOW His chief reward for the painful exertion of disclosing past sorrows and present humiliations, was given in the pitying eye with which Marianne sometimes observed him, and the gentleness of her voice whenever (though it did not often happen) she was obliged, or could oblige herself to speak to him. END
BEGIN NOW THESE assured him that his exertion had produced an increase of good-will towards himself, and THESE gave Elinor hopes of its being farther augmented hereafter; but Mrs. Jennings, who knew nothing of all this, who knew only that the Colonel continued as grave as ever, and that she could neither prevail on him to make the offer himself, nor commission her to make it for him, began, at the end of two days, to think that, instead of Midsummer, they would not be married till Michaelmas, and by the end of a week that it would not be a match at all. END
BEGIN NOW The good understanding between the Colonel and Miss Dashwood seemed rather to declare that the honours of the mulberry-tree, the canal, and the yew arbour, would all be made over to HER; and Mrs. Jennings had, for some time ceased to think at all of Mrs. Ferrars. END
BEGIN NOW Early in February, within a fortnight from the receipt of Willoughby's letter, Elinor had the painful office of informing her sister that he was married. END
BEGIN NOW She had taken care to have the intelligence conveyed to herself, as soon as it was known that the ceremony was over, as she was desirous that Marianne should not receive the first notice of it from the public papers, which she saw her eagerly examining every morning. END
BEGIN NOW She received the news with resolute composure; made no observation on it, and at first shed no tears; but after a short time they would burst out, and for the rest of the day, she was in a state hardly less pitiable than when she first learnt to expect the event. END
BEGIN NOW The Willoughbys left town as soon as they were married; and Elinor now hoped, as there could be no danger of her seeing either of them, to prevail on her sister, who had never yet left the house since the blow first fell, to go out again by degrees as she had done before. END
BEGIN NOW About this time the two Miss Steeles, lately arrived at their cousin's house in Bartlett's Buildings, Holburn, presented themselves again before their more grand relations in Conduit and Berkeley Streets; and were welcomed by them all with great cordiality. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor only was sorry to see them. END
BEGIN NOW Their presence always gave her pain, and she hardly knew how to make a very gracious return to the overpowering delight of Lucy in finding her STILL in town. END
BEGIN NOW I should have been quite disappointed if I had not found you here STILL, said she repeatedly, with a strong emphasis on the word. END
BEGIN NOW But I always thought I SHOULD. END
BEGIN NOW I was almost sure you would not leave London yet awhile; though you TOLD me, you know, at Barton, that you should not stay above a MONTH. END
BEGIN NOW But I thought, at the time, that you would most likely change your mind when it came to the point. END
BEGIN NOW It would have been such a great pity to have went away before your brother and sister came. END
BEGIN NOW And now to be sure you will be in no hurry to be gone. END
BEGIN NOW I am amazingly glad you did not keep to YOUR WORD. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor perfectly understood her, and was forced to use all her self-command to make it appear that she did NOT. END
BEGIN NOW Well, my dear, said Mrs. Jennings, and how did you travel? END
BEGIN NOW Not in the stage, I assure you, replied Miss Steele, with quick exultation; we came post all the way, and had a very smart beau to attend us. END
BEGIN NOW Dr. Davies was coming to town, and so we thought we'd join him in a post-chaise; and he behaved very genteelly, and paid ten or twelve shillings more than we did. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, oh! END
BEGIN NOW cried Mrs. Jennings; very pretty, indeed! END
BEGIN NOW and the Doctor is a single man, I warrant you. END
BEGIN NOW There now, said Miss Steele, affectedly simpering, everybody laughs at me so about the Doctor, and I cannot think why. END
BEGIN NOW My cousins say they are sure I have made a conquest; but for my part I declare I never think about him from one hour's end to another. END
BEGIN NOW 'Lord! END
BEGIN NOW here comes your beau, Nancy,' my cousin said t'other day, when she saw him crossing the street to the house. END
BEGIN NOW My beau, indeed! END
BEGIN NOW said I&mdash;I cannot think who you mean. END
BEGIN NOW The Doctor is no beau of mine. END
BEGIN NOW Aye, aye, that is very pretty talking&mdash;but it won't do&mdash;the Doctor is the man, I see. END
BEGIN NOW No, indeed! END
BEGIN NOW replied her cousin, with affected earnestness, and I beg you will contradict it, if you ever hear it talked of. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Jennings directly gave her the gratifying assurance that she certainly would NOT, and Miss Steele was made completely happy. END
BEGIN NOW I suppose you will go and stay with your brother and sister, Miss Dashwood, when they come to town, said Lucy, returning, after a cessation of hostile hints, to the charge. END
BEGIN NOW No, I do not think we shall. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, yes, I dare say you will. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor would not humour her by farther opposition. END
BEGIN NOW What a charming thing it is that Mrs. Dashwood can spare you both for so long a time together! END
BEGIN NOW Long a time, indeed! END
BEGIN NOW interposed Mrs. Jennings. END
BEGIN NOW Why, their visit is but just begun! END
BEGIN NOW Lucy was silenced. END
BEGIN NOW I am sorry we cannot see your sister, Miss Dashwood, said Miss Steele. END
BEGIN NOW I am sorry she is not well&mdash; for Marianne had left the room on their arrival. END
BEGIN NOW You are very good. END
BEGIN NOW My sister will be equally sorry to miss the pleasure of seeing you; but she has been very much plagued lately with nervous head-aches, which make her unfit for company or conversation. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, dear, that is a great pity! END
BEGIN NOW but such old friends as Lucy and me!&mdash;I think she might see US; and I am sure we would not speak a word. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor, with great civility, declined the proposal. END
BEGIN NOW Her sister was perhaps laid down upon the bed, or in her dressing gown, and therefore not able to come to them. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, if that's all, cried Miss Steele, we can just as well go and see HER. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor began to find this impertinence too much for her temper; but she was saved the trouble of checking it, by Lucy's sharp reprimand, which now, as on many occasions, though it did not give much sweetness to the manners of one sister, was of advantage in governing those of the other. END
BEGIN NOW After some opposition, Marianne yielded to her sister's entreaties, and consented to go out with her and Mrs. Jennings one morning for half an hour. END
BEGIN NOW She expressly conditioned, however, for paying no visits, and would do no more than accompany them to Gray's in Sackville Street, where Elinor was carrying on a negotiation for the exchange of a few old-fashioned jewels of her mother. END
BEGIN NOW When they stopped at the door, Mrs. Jennings recollected that there was a lady at the other end of the street on whom she ought to call; and as she had no business at Gray's, it was resolved, that while her young friends transacted their's, she should pay her visit and return for them. END
BEGIN NOW On ascending the stairs, the Miss Dashwoods found so many people before them in the room, that there was not a person at liberty to tend to their orders; and they were obliged to wait. END
BEGIN NOW All that could be done was, to sit down at that end of the counter which seemed to promise the quickest succession; one gentleman only was standing there, and it is probable that Elinor was not without hope of exciting his politeness to a quicker despatch. END
BEGIN NOW But the correctness of his eye, and the delicacy of his taste, proved to be beyond his politeness. END
BEGIN NOW He was giving orders for a toothpick-case for himself, and till its size, shape, and ornaments were determined, all of which, after examining and debating for a quarter of an hour over every toothpick-case in the shop, were finally arranged by his own inventive fancy, he had no leisure to bestow any other attention on the two ladies, than what was comprised in three or four very broad stares; a kind of notice which served to imprint on Elinor the remembrance of a person and face, of strong, natural, sterling insignificance, though adorned in the first style of fashion. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne was spared from the troublesome feelings of contempt and resentment, on this impertinent examination of their features, and on the puppyism of his manner in deciding on all the different horrors of the different toothpick-cases presented to his inspection, by remaining unconscious of it all; for she was as well able to collect her thoughts within herself, and be as ignorant of what was passing around her, in Mr. Gray's shop, as in her own bedroom. END
BEGIN NOW At last the affair was decided. END
BEGIN NOW The ivory, the gold, and the pearls, all received their appointment, and the gentleman having named the last day on which his existence could be continued without the possession of the toothpick-case, drew on his gloves with leisurely care, and bestowing another glance on the Miss Dashwoods, but such a one as seemed rather to demand than express admiration, walked off with a happy air of real conceit and affected indifference. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor lost no time in bringing her business forward, was on the point of concluding it, when another gentleman presented himself at her side. END
BEGIN NOW She turned her eyes towards his face, and found him with some surprise to be her brother. END
BEGIN NOW Their affection and pleasure in meeting was just enough to make a very creditable appearance in Mr. Gray's shop. END
BEGIN NOW John Dashwood was really far from being sorry to see his sisters again; it rather gave them satisfaction; and his inquiries after their mother were respectful and attentive. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor found that he and Fanny had been in town two days. END
BEGIN NOW I wished very much to call upon you yesterday, said he, but it was impossible, for we were obliged to take Harry to see the wild beasts at Exeter Exchange; and we spent the rest of the day with Mrs. Ferrars. END
BEGIN NOW Harry was vastly pleased. END
BEGIN NOW THIS morning I had fully intended to call on you, if I could possibly find a spare half hour, but one has always so much to do on first coming to town. END
BEGIN NOW I am come here to bespeak Fanny a seal. END
BEGIN NOW But tomorrow I think I shall certainly be able to call in Berkeley Street, and be introduced to your friend Mrs. Jennings. END
BEGIN NOW I understand she is a woman of very good fortune. END
BEGIN NOW And the Middletons too, you must introduce me to THEM. END
BEGIN NOW As my mother-in-law's relations, I shall be happy to show them every respect. END
BEGIN NOW They are excellent neighbours to you in the country, I understand. END
BEGIN NOW Excellent indeed. END
BEGIN NOW Their attention to our comfort, their friendliness in every particular, is more than I can express. END
BEGIN NOW I am extremely glad to hear it, upon my word; extremely glad indeed. END
BEGIN NOW But so it ought to be; they are people of large fortune, they are related to you, and every civility and accommodation that can serve to make your situation pleasant might be reasonably expected. END
BEGIN NOW And so you are most comfortably settled in your little cottage and want for nothing! END
BEGIN NOW Edward brought us a most charming account of the place: the most complete thing of its kind, he said, that ever was, and you all seemed to enjoy it beyond any thing. END
BEGIN NOW It was a great satisfaction to us to hear it, I assure you. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor did feel a little ashamed of her brother; and was not sorry to be spared the necessity of answering him, by the arrival of Mrs. Jennings's servant, who came to tell her that his mistress waited for them at the door. END
BEGIN NOW Mr. Dashwood attended them down stairs, was introduced to Mrs. Jennings at the door of her carriage, and repeating his hope of being able to call on them the next day, took leave. END
BEGIN NOW His visit was duly paid. END
BEGIN NOW He came with a pretence at an apology from their sister-in-law, for not coming too; but she was so much engaged with her mother, that really she had no leisure for going any where. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Jennings, however, assured him directly, that she should not stand upon ceremony, for they were all cousins, or something like it, and she should certainly wait on Mrs. John Dashwood very soon, and bring her sisters to see her. END
BEGIN NOW His manners to THEM, though calm, were perfectly kind; to Mrs. Jennings, most attentively civil; and on Colonel Brandon's coming in soon after himself, he eyed him with a curiosity which seemed to say, that he only wanted to know him to be rich, to be equally civil to HIM. END
BEGIN NOW After staying with them half an hour, he asked Elinor to walk with him to Conduit Street, and introduce him to Sir John and Lady Middleton. END
BEGIN NOW The weather was remarkably fine, and she readily consented. END
BEGIN NOW As soon as they were out of the house, his enquiries began. END
BEGIN NOW Who is Colonel Brandon? END
BEGIN NOW Is he a man of fortune? END
BEGIN NOW Yes; he has very good property in Dorsetshire. END
BEGIN NOW I am glad of it. END
BEGIN NOW He seems a most gentlemanlike man; and I think, Elinor, I may congratulate you on the prospect of a very respectable establishment in life. END
BEGIN NOW Me, brother! END
BEGIN NOW what do you mean? END
BEGIN NOW He likes you. END
BEGIN NOW I observed him narrowly, and am convinced of it. END
BEGIN NOW What is the amount of his fortune? END
BEGIN NOW I believe about two thousand a year. END
BEGIN NOW Two thousand a-year; and then working himself up to a pitch of enthusiastic generosity, he added, Elinor, I wish with all my heart it were TWICE as much, for your sake. END
BEGIN NOW Indeed I believe you, replied Elinor; but I am very sure that Colonel Brandon has not the smallest wish of marrying ME. END
BEGIN NOW You are mistaken, Elinor; you are very much mistaken. END
BEGIN NOW A very little trouble on your side secures him. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps just at present he may be undecided; the smallness of your fortune may make him hang back; his friends may all advise him against it. END
BEGIN NOW But some of those little attentions and encouragements which ladies can so easily give will fix him, in spite of himself. END
BEGIN NOW And there can be no reason why you should not try for him. END
BEGIN NOW It is not to be supposed that any prior attachment on your side&mdash;in short, you know as to an attachment of that kind, it is quite out of the question, the objections are insurmountable&mdash;you have too much sense not to see all that. END
BEGIN NOW Colonel Brandon must be the man; and no civility shall be wanting on my part to make him pleased with you and your family. END
BEGIN NOW It is a match that must give universal satisfaction. END
BEGIN NOW In short, it is a kind of thing that &mdash;lowering his voice to an important whisper&mdash; will be exceedingly welcome to ALL PARTIES. END
BEGIN NOW Recollecting himself, however, he added, That is, I mean to say&mdash;your friends are all truly anxious to see you well settled; Fanny particularly, for she has your interest very much at heart, I assure you. END
BEGIN NOW And her mother too, Mrs. Ferrars, a very good-natured woman, I am sure it would give her great pleasure; she said as much the other day. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor would not vouchsafe any answer. END
BEGIN NOW It would be something remarkable, now, he continued, something droll, if Fanny should have a brother and I a sister settling at the same time. END
BEGIN NOW And yet it is not very unlikely. END
BEGIN NOW Is Mr. Edward Ferrars, said Elinor, with resolution, going to be married? END
BEGIN NOW It is not actually settled, but there is such a thing in agitation. END
BEGIN NOW He has a most excellent mother. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Ferrars, with the utmost liberality, will come forward, and settle on him a thousand a year, if the match takes place. END
BEGIN NOW The lady is the Hon. END
BEGIN NOW Miss Morton, only daughter of the late Lord Morton, with thirty thousand pounds. END
BEGIN NOW A very desirable connection on both sides, and I have not a doubt of its taking place in time. END
BEGIN NOW A thousand a-year is a great deal for a mother to give away, to make over for ever; but Mrs. Ferrars has a noble spirit. END
BEGIN NOW To give you another instance of her liberality:&mdash;The other day, as soon as we came to town, aware that money could not be very plenty with us just now, she put bank-notes into Fanny's hands to the amount of two hundred pounds. END
BEGIN NOW And extremely acceptable it is, for we must live at a great expense while we are here. END
BEGIN NOW He paused for her assent and compassion; and she forced herself to say, Your expenses both in town and country must certainly be considerable; but your income is a large one. END
BEGIN NOW Not so large, I dare say, as many people suppose. END
BEGIN NOW I do not mean to complain, however; it is undoubtedly a comfortable one, and I hope will in time be better. END
BEGIN NOW The enclosure of Norland Common, now carrying on, is a most serious drain. END
BEGIN NOW And then I have made a little purchase within this half year; East Kingham Farm, you must remember the place, where old Gibson used to live. END
BEGIN NOW The land was so very desirable for me in every respect, so immediately adjoining my own property, that I felt it my duty to buy it. END
BEGIN NOW I could not have answered it to my conscience to let it fall into any other hands. END
BEGIN NOW A man must pay for his convenience; and it HAS cost me a vast deal of money. END
BEGIN NOW More than you think it really and intrinsically worth. END
BEGIN NOW Why, I hope not that. END
BEGIN NOW I might have sold it again, the next day, for more than I gave: but, with regard to the purchase-money, I might have been very unfortunate indeed; for the stocks were at that time so low, that if I had not happened to have the necessary sum in my banker's hands, I must have sold out to very great loss. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor could only smile. END
BEGIN NOW Other great and inevitable expenses too we have had on first coming to Norland. END
BEGIN NOW Our respected father, as you well know, bequeathed all the Stanhill effects that remained at Norland (and very valuable they were) to your mother. END
BEGIN NOW Far be it from me to repine at his doing so; he had an undoubted right to dispose of his own property as he chose, but, in consequence of it, we have been obliged to make large purchases of linen, china, &c. to supply the place of what was taken away. END
BEGIN NOW You may guess, after all these expenses, how very far we must be from being rich, and how acceptable Mrs. Ferrars's kindness is. END
BEGIN NOW Certainly, said Elinor; and assisted by her liberality, I hope you may yet live to be in easy circumstances. END
BEGIN NOW Another year or two may do much towards it, he gravely replied; but however there is still a great deal to be done. END
BEGIN NOW There is not a stone laid of Fanny's green-house, and nothing but the plan of the flower-garden marked out. END
BEGIN NOW Where is the green-house to be? END
BEGIN NOW Upon the knoll behind the house. END
BEGIN NOW The old walnut trees are all come down to make room for it. END
BEGIN NOW It will be a very fine object from many parts of the park, and the flower-garden will slope down just before it, and be exceedingly pretty. END
BEGIN NOW We have cleared away all the old thorns that grew in patches over the brow. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor kept her concern and her censure to herself; and was very thankful that Marianne was not present, to share the provocation. END
BEGIN NOW Having now said enough to make his poverty clear, and to do away the necessity of buying a pair of ear-rings for each of his sisters, in his next visit at Gray's his thoughts took a cheerfuller turn, and he began to congratulate Elinor on having such a friend as Mrs. Jennings. END
BEGIN NOW She seems a most valuable woman indeed&mdash;Her house, her style of living, all bespeak an exceeding good income; and it is an acquaintance that has not only been of great use to you hitherto, but in the end may prove materially advantageous.&mdash;Her inviting you to town is certainly a vast thing in your favour; and indeed, it speaks altogether so great a regard for you, that in all probability when she dies you will not be forgotten.&mdash; She must have a great deal to leave. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing at all, I should rather suppose; for she has only her jointure, which will descend to her children. END
BEGIN NOW But it is not to be imagined that she lives up to her income. END
BEGIN NOW Few people of common prudence will do THAT; and whatever she saves, she will be able to dispose of. END
BEGIN NOW And do you not think it more likely that she should leave it to her daughters, than to us? END
BEGIN NOW Her daughters are both exceedingly well married, and therefore I cannot perceive the necessity of her remembering them farther. END
BEGIN NOW Whereas, in my opinion, by her taking so much notice of you, and treating you in this kind of way, she has given you a sort of claim on her future consideration, which a conscientious woman would not disregard. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing can be kinder than her behaviour; and she can hardly do all this, without being aware of the expectation it raises. END
BEGIN NOW But she raises none in those most concerned. END
BEGIN NOW Indeed, brother, your anxiety for our welfare and prosperity carries you too far. END
BEGIN NOW Why, to be sure, said he, seeming to recollect himself, people have little, have very little in their power. END
BEGIN NOW But, my dear Elinor, what is the matter with Marianne?&mdash; she looks very unwell, has lost her colour, and is grown quite thin. END
BEGIN NOW Is she ill? END
BEGIN NOW She is not well, she has had a nervous complaint on her for several weeks. END
BEGIN NOW I am sorry for that. END
BEGIN NOW At her time of life, any thing of an illness destroys the bloom for ever! END
BEGIN NOW Hers has been a very short one! END
BEGIN NOW She was as handsome a girl last September, as I ever saw; and as likely to attract the man. END
BEGIN NOW There was something in her style of beauty, to please them particularly. END
BEGIN NOW I remember Fanny used to say that she would marry sooner and better than you did; not but what she is exceedingly fond of YOU, but so it happened to strike her. END
BEGIN NOW She will be mistaken, however. END
BEGIN NOW I question whether Marianne NOW, will marry a man worth more than five or six hundred a-year, at the utmost, and I am very much deceived if YOU do not do better. END
BEGIN NOW Dorsetshire! END
BEGIN NOW I know very little of Dorsetshire; but, my dear Elinor, I shall be exceedingly glad to know more of it; and I think I can answer for your having Fanny and myself among the earliest and best pleased of your visitors. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor tried very seriously to convince him that there was no likelihood of her marrying Colonel Brandon; but it was an expectation of too much pleasure to himself to be relinquished, and he was really resolved on seeking an intimacy with that gentleman, and promoting the marriage by every possible attention. END
BEGIN NOW He had just compunction enough for having done nothing for his sisters himself, to be exceedingly anxious that everybody else should do a great deal; and an offer from Colonel Brandon, or a legacy from Mrs. Jennings, was the easiest means of atoning for his own neglect. END
BEGIN NOW They were lucky enough to find Lady Middleton at home, and Sir John came in before their visit ended. END
BEGIN NOW Abundance of civilities passed on all sides. END
BEGIN NOW Sir John was ready to like anybody, and though Mr. Dashwood did not seem to know much about horses, he soon set him down as a very good-natured fellow: while Lady Middleton saw enough of fashion in his appearance to think his acquaintance worth having; and Mr. Dashwood went away delighted with both. END
BEGIN NOW I shall have a charming account to carry to Fanny, said he, as he walked back with his sister. END
BEGIN NOW Lady Middleton is really a most elegant woman! END
BEGIN NOW Such a woman as I am sure Fanny will be glad to know. END
BEGIN NOW And Mrs. Jennings too, an exceedingly well-behaved woman, though not so elegant as her daughter. END
BEGIN NOW Your sister need not have any scruple even of visiting HER, which, to say the truth, has been a little the case, and very naturally; for we only knew that Mrs. Jennings was the widow of a man who had got all his money in a low way; and Fanny and Mrs. Ferrars were both strongly prepossessed, that neither she nor her daughters were such kind of women as Fanny would like to associate with. END
BEGIN NOW But now I can carry her a most satisfactory account of both. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. John Dashwood had so much confidence in her husband's judgment, that she waited the very next day both on Mrs. Jennings and her daughter; and her confidence was rewarded by finding even the former, even the woman with whom her sisters were staying, by no means unworthy her notice; and as for Lady Middleton, she found her one of the most charming women in the world! END
BEGIN NOW Lady Middleton was equally pleased with Mrs. Dashwood. END
BEGIN NOW There was a kind of cold hearted selfishness on both sides, which mutually attracted them; and they sympathised with each other in an insipid propriety of demeanor, and a general want of understanding. END
BEGIN NOW The same manners, however, which recommended Mrs. John Dashwood to the good opinion of Lady Middleton did not suit the fancy of Mrs. Jennings, and to HER she appeared nothing more than a little proud-looking woman of uncordial address, who met her husband's sisters without any affection, and almost without having anything to say to them; for of the quarter of an hour bestowed on Berkeley Street, she sat at least seven minutes and a half in silence. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor wanted very much to know, though she did not chuse to ask, whether Edward was then in town; but nothing would have induced Fanny voluntarily to mention his name before her, till able to tell her that his marriage with Miss Morton was resolved on, or till her husband's expectations on Colonel Brandon were answered; because she believed them still so very much attached to each other, that they could not be too sedulously divided in word and deed on every occasion. END
BEGIN NOW The intelligence however, which SHE would not give, soon flowed from another quarter. END
BEGIN NOW Lucy came very shortly to claim Elinor's compassion on being unable to see Edward, though he had arrived in town with Mr. and Mrs. Dashwood. END
BEGIN NOW He dared not come to Bartlett's Buildings for fear of detection, and though their mutual impatience to meet, was not to be told, they could do nothing at present but write. END
BEGIN NOW Edward assured them himself of his being in town, within a very short time, by twice calling in Berkeley Street. END
BEGIN NOW Twice was his card found on the table, when they returned from their morning's engagements. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor was pleased that he had called; and still more pleased that she had missed him. END
BEGIN NOW The Dashwoods were so prodigiously delighted with the Middletons, that, though not much in the habit of giving anything, they determined to give them&mdash;a dinner; and soon after their acquaintance began, invited them to dine in Harley Street, where they had taken a very good house for three months. END
BEGIN NOW Their sisters and Mrs. Jennings were invited likewise, and John Dashwood was careful to secure Colonel Brandon, who, always glad to be where the Miss Dashwoods were, received his eager civilities with some surprise, but much more pleasure. END
BEGIN NOW They were to meet Mrs. Ferrars; but Elinor could not learn whether her sons were to be of the party. END
BEGIN NOW The expectation of seeing HER, however, was enough to make her interested in the engagement; for though she could now meet Edward's mother without that strong anxiety which had once promised to attend such an introduction, though she could now see her with perfect indifference as to her opinion of herself, her desire of being in company with Mrs. Ferrars, her curiosity to know what she was like, was as lively as ever. END
BEGIN NOW The interest with which she thus anticipated the party, was soon afterwards increased, more powerfully than pleasantly, by her hearing that the Miss Steeles were also to be at it. END
BEGIN NOW So well had they recommended themselves to Lady Middleton, so agreeable had their assiduities made them to her, that though Lucy was certainly not so elegant, and her sister not even genteel, she was as ready as Sir John to ask them to spend a week or two in Conduit Street; and it happened to be particularly convenient to the Miss Steeles, as soon as the Dashwoods' invitation was known, that their visit should begin a few days before the party took place. END
BEGIN NOW Their claims to the notice of Mrs. John Dashwood, as the nieces of the gentleman who for many years had had the care of her brother, might not have done much, however, towards procuring them seats at her table; but as Lady Middleton's guests they must be welcome; and Lucy, who had long wanted to be personally known to the family, to have a nearer view of their characters and her own difficulties, and to have an opportunity of endeavouring to please them, had seldom been happier in her life, than she was on receiving Mrs. John Dashwood's card. END
BEGIN NOW On Elinor its effect was very different. END
BEGIN NOW She began immediately to determine, that Edward who lived with his mother, must be asked as his mother was, to a party given by his sister; and to see him for the first time, after all that passed, in the company of Lucy!&mdash;she hardly knew how she could bear it! END
BEGIN NOW These apprehensions, perhaps, were not founded entirely on reason, and certainly not at all on truth. END
BEGIN NOW They were relieved however, not by her own recollection, but by the good will of Lucy, who believed herself to be inflicting a severe disappointment when she told her that Edward certainly would not be in Harley Street on Tuesday, and even hoped to be carrying the pain still farther by persuading her that he was kept away by the extreme affection for herself, which he could not conceal when they were together. END
BEGIN NOW The important Tuesday came that was to introduce the two young ladies to this formidable mother-in-law. END
BEGIN NOW Pity me, dear Miss Dashwood! END
BEGIN NOW said Lucy, as they walked up the stairs together&mdash;for the Middletons arrived so directly after Mrs. Jennings, that they all followed the servant at the same time&mdash; There is nobody here but you, that can feel for me.&mdash;I declare I can hardly stand. END
BEGIN NOW Good gracious!&mdash;In a moment I shall see the person that all my happiness depends on&mdash;that is to be my mother! END
BEGIN NOW &mdash; Elinor could have given her immediate relief by suggesting the possibility of its being Miss Morton's mother, rather than her own, whom they were about to behold; but instead of doing that, she assured her, and with great sincerity, that she did pity her&mdash;to the utter amazement of Lucy, who, though really uncomfortable herself, hoped at least to be an object of irrepressible envy to Elinor. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Ferrars was a little, thin woman, upright, even to formality, in her figure, and serious, even to sourness, in her aspect. END
BEGIN NOW Her complexion was sallow; and her features small, without beauty, and naturally without expression; but a lucky contraction of the brow had rescued her countenance from the disgrace of insipidity, by giving it the strong characters of pride and ill nature. END
BEGIN NOW She was not a woman of many words; for, unlike people in general, she proportioned them to the number of her ideas; and of the few syllables that did escape her, not one fell to the share of Miss Dashwood, whom she eyed with the spirited determination of disliking her at all events. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor could not NOW be made unhappy by this behaviour.&mdash; A few months ago it would have hurt her exceedingly; but it was not in Mrs. Ferrars' power to distress her by it now;&mdash;and the difference of her manners to the Miss Steeles, a difference which seemed purposely made to humble her more, only amused her. END
BEGIN NOW She could not but smile to see the graciousness of both mother and daughter towards the very person&mdash; for Lucy was particularly distinguished&mdash;whom of all others, had they known as much as she did, they would have been most anxious to mortify; while she herself, who had comparatively no power to wound them, sat pointedly slighted by both. END
BEGIN NOW But while she smiled at a graciousness so misapplied, she could not reflect on the mean-spirited folly from which it sprung, nor observe the studied attentions with which the Miss Steeles courted its continuance, without thoroughly despising them all four. END
BEGIN NOW Lucy was all exultation on being so honorably distinguished; and Miss Steele wanted only to be teazed about Dr. Davies to be perfectly happy. END
BEGIN NOW The dinner was a grand one, the servants were numerous, and every thing bespoke the Mistress's inclination for show, and the Master's ability to support it. END
BEGIN NOW In spite of the improvements and additions which were making to the Norland estate, and in spite of its owner having once been within some thousand pounds of being obliged to sell out at a loss, nothing gave any symptom of that indigence which he had tried to infer from it;&mdash;no poverty of any kind, except of conversation, appeared&mdash;but there, the deficiency was considerable. END
BEGIN NOW John Dashwood had not much to say for himself that was worth hearing, and his wife had still less. END
BEGIN NOW But there was no peculiar disgrace in this; for it was very much the case with the chief of their visitors, who almost all laboured under one or other of these disqualifications for being agreeable&mdash;Want of sense, either natural or improved&mdash;want of elegance&mdash;want of spirits&mdash;or want of temper. END
BEGIN NOW When the ladies withdrew to the drawing-room after dinner, this poverty was particularly evident, for the gentlemen HAD supplied the discourse with some variety&mdash;the variety of politics, inclosing land, and breaking horses&mdash;but then it was all over; and one subject only engaged the ladies till coffee came in, which was the comparative heights of Harry Dashwood, and Lady Middleton's second son William, who were nearly of the same age. END
BEGIN NOW Had both the children been there, the affair might have been determined too easily by measuring them at once; but as Harry only was present, it was all conjectural assertion on both sides; and every body had a right to be equally positive in their opinion, and to repeat it over and over again as often as they liked. END
BEGIN NOW The parties stood thus: The two mothers, though each really convinced that her own son was the tallest, politely decided in favour of the other. END
BEGIN NOW The two grandmothers, with not less partiality, but more sincerity, were equally earnest in support of their own descendant. END
BEGIN NOW Lucy, who was hardly less anxious to please one parent than the other, thought the boys were both remarkably tall for their age, and could not conceive that there could be the smallest difference in the world between them; and Miss Steele, with yet greater address gave it, as fast as she could, in favour of each. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor, having once delivered her opinion on William's side, by which she offended Mrs. Ferrars and Fanny still more, did not see the necessity of enforcing it by any farther assertion; and Marianne, when called on for hers, offended them all, by declaring that she had no opinion to give, as she had never thought about it. END
BEGIN NOW Before her removing from Norland, Elinor had painted a very pretty pair of screens for her sister-in-law, which being now just mounted and brought home, ornamented her present drawing room; and these screens, catching the eye of John Dashwood on his following the other gentlemen into the room, were officiously handed by him to Colonel Brandon for his admiration. END
BEGIN NOW These are done by my eldest sister, said he; and you, as a man of taste, will, I dare say, be pleased with them. END
BEGIN NOW I do not know whether you have ever happened to see any of her performances before, but she is in general reckoned to draw extremely well. END
BEGIN NOW The Colonel, though disclaiming all pretensions to connoisseurship, warmly admired the screens, as he would have done any thing painted by Miss Dashwood; and on the curiosity of the others being of course excited, they were handed round for general inspection. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Ferrars, not aware of their being Elinor's work, particularly requested to look at them; and after they had received gratifying testimony of Lady Middletons's approbation, Fanny presented them to her mother, considerately informing her, at the same time, that they were done by Miss Dashwood. END
BEGIN NOW Hum &mdash;said Mrs. Ferrars&mdash; very pretty, &mdash;and without regarding them at all, returned them to her daughter. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps Fanny thought for a moment that her mother had been quite rude enough,&mdash;for, colouring a little, she immediately said, They are very pretty, ma'am&mdash;an't they? END
BEGIN NOW But then again, the dread of having been too civil, too encouraging herself, probably came over her, for she presently added, Do you not think they are something in Miss Morton's style of painting, Ma'am?&mdash;She DOES paint most delightfully!&mdash;How beautifully her last landscape is done! END
BEGIN NOW Beautifully indeed! END
BEGIN NOW But SHE does every thing well. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne could not bear this.&mdash;She was already greatly displeased with Mrs. Ferrars; and such ill-timed praise of another, at Elinor's expense, though she had not any notion of what was principally meant by it, provoked her immediately to say with warmth, This is admiration of a very particular kind!&mdash;what is Miss Morton to us?&mdash;who knows, or who cares, for her?&mdash;it is Elinor of whom WE think and speak. END
BEGIN NOW And so saying, she took the screens out of her sister-in-law's hands, to admire them herself as they ought to be admired. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Ferrars looked exceedingly angry, and drawing herself up more stiffly than ever, pronounced in retort this bitter philippic, Miss Morton is Lord Morton's daughter. END
BEGIN NOW Fanny looked very angry too, and her husband was all in a fright at his sister's audacity. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor was much more hurt by Marianne's warmth than she had been by what produced it; but Colonel Brandon's eyes, as they were fixed on Marianne, declared that he noticed only what was amiable in it, the affectionate heart which could not bear to see a sister slighted in the smallest point. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne's feelings did not stop here. END
BEGIN NOW The cold insolence of Mrs. Ferrars's general behaviour to her sister, seemed, to her, to foretell such difficulties and distresses to Elinor, as her own wounded heart taught her to think of with horror; and urged by a strong impulse of affectionate sensibility, she moved after a moment, to her sister's chair, and putting one arm round her neck, and one cheek close to hers, said in a low, but eager, voice, Dear, dear Elinor, don't mind them. END
BEGIN NOW Don't let them make YOU unhappy. END
BEGIN NOW She could say no more; her spirits were quite overcome, and hiding her face on Elinor's shoulder, she burst into tears. END
BEGIN NOW Every body's attention was called, and almost every body was concerned.&mdash;Colonel Brandon rose up and went to them without knowing what he did.&mdash;Mrs. Jennings, with a very intelligent Ah! END
BEGIN NOW poor dear, immediately gave her her salts; and Sir John felt so desperately enraged against the author of this nervous distress, that he instantly changed his seat to one close by Lucy Steele, and gave her, in a whisper, a brief account of the whole shocking affair. END
BEGIN NOW In a few minutes, however, Marianne was recovered enough to put an end to the bustle, and sit down among the rest; though her spirits retained the impression of what had passed, the whole evening. END
BEGIN NOW Poor Marianne! END
BEGIN NOW said her brother to Colonel Brandon, in a low voice, as soon as he could secure his attention,&mdash; She has not such good health as her sister,&mdash;she is very nervous,&mdash;she has not Elinor's constitution;&mdash;and one must allow that there is something very trying to a young woman who HAS BEEN a beauty in the loss of her personal attractions. END
BEGIN NOW You would not think it perhaps, but Marianne WAS remarkably handsome a few months ago; quite as handsome as Elinor.&mdash; Now you see it is all gone. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor's curiosity to see Mrs. Ferrars was satisfied.&mdash; She had found in her every thing that could tend to make a farther connection between the families undesirable.&mdash; She had seen enough of her pride, her meanness, and her determined prejudice against herself, to comprehend all the difficulties that must have perplexed the engagement, and retarded the marriage, of Edward and herself, had he been otherwise free;&mdash;and she had seen almost enough to be thankful for her OWN sake, that one greater obstacle preserved her from suffering under any other of Mrs. Ferrars's creation, preserved her from all dependence upon her caprice, or any solicitude for her good opinion. END
BEGIN NOW Or at least, if she did not bring herself quite to rejoice in Edward's being fettered to Lucy, she determined, that had Lucy been more amiable, she OUGHT to have rejoiced. END
BEGIN NOW She wondered that Lucy's spirits could be so very much elevated by the civility of Mrs. Ferrars;&mdash;that her interest and her vanity should so very much blind her as to make the attention which seemed only paid her because she was NOT ELINOR, appear a compliment to herself&mdash;or to allow her to derive encouragement from a preference only given her, because her real situation was unknown. END
BEGIN NOW But that it was so, had not only been declared by Lucy's eyes at the time, but was declared over again the next morning more openly, for at her particular desire, Lady Middleton set her down in Berkeley Street on the chance of seeing Elinor alone, to tell her how happy she was. END
BEGIN NOW The chance proved a lucky one, for a message from Mrs. Palmer soon after she arrived, carried Mrs. Jennings away. END
BEGIN NOW My dear friend, cried Lucy, as soon as they were by themselves, I come to talk to you of my happiness. END
BEGIN NOW Could anything be so flattering as Mrs. Ferrars's way of treating me yesterday? END
BEGIN NOW So exceeding affable as she was!&mdash;You know how I dreaded the thoughts of seeing her;&mdash;but the very moment I was introduced, there was such an affability in her behaviour as really should seem to say, she had quite took a fancy to me. END
BEGIN NOW Now was not it so?&mdash; You saw it all; and was not you quite struck with it? END
BEGIN NOW She was certainly very civil to you. END
BEGIN NOW Civil!&mdash;Did you see nothing but only civility?&mdash; I saw a vast deal more. END
BEGIN NOW Such kindness as fell to the share of nobody but me!&mdash;No pride, no hauteur, and your sister just the same&mdash;all sweetness and affability! END
BEGIN NOW Elinor wished to talk of something else, but Lucy still pressed her to own that she had reason for her happiness; and Elinor was obliged to go on.&mdash; Undoubtedly, if they had known your engagement, said she, nothing could be more flattering than their treatment of you;&mdash;but as that was not the case &mdash; I guessed you would say so, &mdash;replied Lucy quickly&mdash; but there was no reason in the world why Mrs. Ferrars should seem to like me, if she did not, and her liking me is every thing. END
BEGIN NOW You shan't talk me out of my satisfaction. END
BEGIN NOW I am sure it will all end well, and there will be no difficulties at all, to what I used to think. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Ferrars is a charming woman, and so is your sister. END
BEGIN NOW They are both delightful women, indeed!&mdash;I wonder I should never hear you say how agreeable Mrs. Dashwood was! END
BEGIN NOW To this Elinor had no answer to make, and did not attempt any. END
BEGIN NOW Are you ill, Miss Dashwood?&mdash;you seem low&mdash;you don't speak;&mdash;sure you an't well. END
BEGIN NOW I never was in better health. END
BEGIN NOW I am glad of it with all my heart; but really you did not look it. END
BEGIN NOW I should be sorry to have YOU ill; you, that have been the greatest comfort to me in the world!&mdash;Heaven knows what I should have done without your friendship. END
BEGIN NOW &mdash; Elinor tried to make a civil answer, though doubting her own success. END
BEGIN NOW But it seemed to satisfy Lucy, for she directly replied, Indeed I am perfectly convinced of your regard for me, and next to Edward's love, it is the greatest comfort I have.&mdash;Poor Edward!&mdash;But now there is one good thing, we shall be able to meet, and meet pretty often, for Lady Middleton's delighted with Mrs. Dashwood, so we shall be a good deal in Harley Street, I dare say, and Edward spends half his time with his sister&mdash;besides, Lady Middleton and Mrs. Ferrars will visit now;&mdash;and Mrs. Ferrars and your sister were both so good to say more than once, they should always be glad to see me.&mdash; They are such charming women!&mdash;I am sure if ever you tell your sister what I think of her, you cannot speak too high. END
BEGIN NOW But Elinor would not give her any encouragement to hope that she SHOULD tell her sister. END
BEGIN NOW Lucy continued. END
BEGIN NOW I am sure I should have seen it in a moment, if Mrs. Ferrars had took a dislike to me. END
BEGIN NOW If she had only made me a formal courtesy, for instance, without saying a word, and never after had took any notice of me, and never looked at me in a pleasant way&mdash;you know what I mean&mdash;if I had been treated in that forbidding sort of way, I should have gave it all up in despair. END
BEGIN NOW I could not have stood it. END
BEGIN NOW For where she DOES dislike, I know it is most violent. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor was prevented from making any reply to this civil triumph, by the door's being thrown open, the servant's announcing Mr. Ferrars, and Edward's immediately walking in. END
BEGIN NOW It was a very awkward moment; and the countenance of each shewed that it was so. END
BEGIN NOW They all looked exceedingly foolish; and Edward seemed to have as great an inclination to walk out of the room again, as to advance farther into it. END
BEGIN NOW The very circumstance, in its unpleasantest form, which they would each have been most anxious to avoid, had fallen on them.&mdash;They were not only all three together, but were together without the relief of any other person. END
BEGIN NOW The ladies recovered themselves first. END
BEGIN NOW It was not Lucy's business to put herself forward, and the appearance of secrecy must still be kept up. END
BEGIN NOW She could therefore only LOOK her tenderness, and after slightly addressing him, said no more. END
BEGIN NOW But Elinor had more to do; and so anxious was she, for his sake and her own, to do it well, that she forced herself, after a moment's recollection, to welcome him, with a look and manner that were almost easy, and almost open; and another struggle, another effort still improved them. END
BEGIN NOW She would not allow the presence of Lucy, nor the consciousness of some injustice towards herself, to deter her from saying that she was happy to see him, and that she had very much regretted being from home, when he called before in Berkeley Street. END
BEGIN NOW She would not be frightened from paying him those attentions which, as a friend and almost a relation, were his due, by the observant eyes of Lucy, though she soon perceived them to be narrowly watching her. END
BEGIN NOW Her manners gave some re-assurance to Edward, and he had courage enough to sit down; but his embarrassment still exceeded that of the ladies in a proportion, which the case rendered reasonable, though his sex might make it rare; for his heart had not the indifference of Lucy's, nor could his conscience have quite the ease of Elinor's. END
BEGIN NOW Lucy, with a demure and settled air, seemed determined to make no contribution to the comfort of the others, and would not say a word; and almost every thing that WAS said, proceeded from Elinor, who was obliged to volunteer all the information about her mother's health, their coming to town, &c. which Edward ought to have inquired about, but never did. END
BEGIN NOW Her exertions did not stop here; for she soon afterwards felt herself so heroically disposed as to determine, under pretence of fetching Marianne, to leave the others by themselves; and she really did it, and THAT in the handsomest manner, for she loitered away several minutes on the landing-place, with the most high-minded fortitude, before she went to her sister. END
BEGIN NOW When that was once done, however, it was time for the raptures of Edward to cease; for Marianne's joy hurried her into the drawing-room immediately. END
BEGIN NOW Her pleasure in seeing him was like every other of her feelings, strong in itself, and strongly spoken. END
BEGIN NOW She met him with a hand that would be taken, and a voice that expressed the affection of a sister. END
BEGIN NOW Dear Edward! END
BEGIN NOW she cried, this is a moment of great happiness!&mdash;This would almost make amends for every thing! END
BEGIN NOW Edward tried to return her kindness as it deserved, but before such witnesses he dared not say half what he really felt. END
BEGIN NOW Again they all sat down, and for a moment or two all were silent; while Marianne was looking with the most speaking tenderness, sometimes at Edward and sometimes at Elinor, regretting only that their delight in each other should be checked by Lucy's unwelcome presence. END
BEGIN NOW Edward was the first to speak, and it was to notice Marianne's altered looks, and express his fear of her not finding London agree with her. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, don't think of me! END
BEGIN NOW she replied with spirited earnestness, though her eyes were filled with tears as she spoke, don't think of MY health. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor is well, you see. END
BEGIN NOW That must be enough for us both. END
BEGIN NOW This remark was not calculated to make Edward or Elinor more easy, nor to conciliate the good will of Lucy, who looked up at Marianne with no very benignant expression. END
BEGIN NOW Do you like London? END
BEGIN NOW said Edward, willing to say any thing that might introduce another subject. END
BEGIN NOW Not at all. END
BEGIN NOW I expected much pleasure in it, but I have found none. END
BEGIN NOW The sight of you, Edward, is the only comfort it has afforded; and thank Heaven! END
BEGIN NOW you are what you always were! END
BEGIN NOW She paused&mdash;no one spoke. END
BEGIN NOW I think, Elinor, she presently added, we must employ Edward to take care of us in our return to Barton. END
BEGIN NOW In a week or two, I suppose, we shall be going; and, I trust, Edward will not be very unwilling to accept the charge. END
BEGIN NOW Poor Edward muttered something, but what it was, nobody knew, not even himself. END
BEGIN NOW But Marianne, who saw his agitation, and could easily trace it to whatever cause best pleased herself, was perfectly satisfied, and soon talked of something else. END
BEGIN NOW We spent such a day, Edward, in Harley Street yesterday! END
BEGIN NOW So dull, so wretchedly dull!&mdash;But I have much to say to you on that head, which cannot be said now. END
BEGIN NOW And with this admirable discretion did she defer the assurance of her finding their mutual relatives more disagreeable than ever, and of her being particularly disgusted with his mother, till they were more in private. END
BEGIN NOW But why were you not there, Edward?&mdash;Why did you not come? END
BEGIN NOW I was engaged elsewhere. END
BEGIN NOW Engaged! END
BEGIN NOW But what was that, when such friends were to be met? END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps, Miss Marianne, cried Lucy, eager to take some revenge on her, you think young men never stand upon engagements, if they have no mind to keep them, little as well as great. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor was very angry, but Marianne seemed entirely insensible of the sting; for she calmly replied, Not so, indeed; for, seriously speaking, I am very sure that conscience only kept Edward from Harley Street. END
BEGIN NOW And I really believe he HAS the most delicate conscience in the world; the most scrupulous in performing every engagement, however minute, and however it may make against his interest or pleasure. END
BEGIN NOW He is the most fearful of giving pain, of wounding expectation, and the most incapable of being selfish, of any body I ever saw. END
BEGIN NOW Edward, it is so, and I will say it. END
BEGIN NOW What! END
BEGIN NOW are you never to hear yourself praised!&mdash;Then you must be no friend of mine; for those who will accept of my love and esteem, must submit to my open commendation. END
BEGIN NOW The nature of her commendation, in the present case, however, happened to be particularly ill-suited to the feelings of two thirds of her auditors, and was so very unexhilarating to Edward, that he very soon got up to go away. END
BEGIN NOW Going so soon! END
BEGIN NOW said Marianne; my dear Edward, this must not be. END
BEGIN NOW And drawing him a little aside, she whispered her persuasion that Lucy could not stay much longer. END
BEGIN NOW But even this encouragement failed, for he would go; and Lucy, who would have outstaid him, had his visit lasted two hours, soon afterwards went away. END
BEGIN NOW What can bring her here so often? END
BEGIN NOW said Marianne, on her leaving them. END
BEGIN NOW Could not she see that we wanted her gone!&mdash;how teazing to Edward! END
BEGIN NOW Why so?&mdash;we were all his friends, and Lucy has been the longest known to him of any. END
BEGIN NOW It is but natural that he should like to see her as well as ourselves. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne looked at her steadily, and said, You know, Elinor, that this is a kind of talking which I cannot bear. END
BEGIN NOW If you only hope to have your assertion contradicted, as I must suppose to be the case, you ought to recollect that I am the last person in the world to do it. END
BEGIN NOW I cannot descend to be tricked out of assurances, that are not really wanted. END
BEGIN NOW She then left the room; and Elinor dared not follow her to say more, for bound as she was by her promise of secrecy to Lucy, she could give no information that would convince Marianne; and painful as the consequences of her still continuing in an error might be, she was obliged to submit to it. END
BEGIN NOW All that she could hope, was that Edward would not often expose her or himself to the distress of hearing Marianne's mistaken warmth, nor to the repetition of any other part of the pain that had attended their recent meeting&mdash;and this she had every reason to expect. END
BEGIN NOW Within a few days after this meeting, the newspapers announced to the world, that the lady of Thomas Palmer, Esq. END
BEGIN NOW was safely delivered of a son and heir; a very interesting and satisfactory paragraph, at least to all those intimate connections who knew it before. END
BEGIN NOW This event, highly important to Mrs. Jennings's happiness, produced a temporary alteration in the disposal of her time, and influenced, in a like degree, the engagements of her young friends; for as she wished to be as much as possible with Charlotte, she went thither every morning as soon as she was dressed, and did not return till late in the evening; and the Miss Dashwoods, at the particular request of the Middletons, spent the whole of every day in Conduit Street. END
BEGIN NOW For their own comfort they would much rather have remained, at least all the morning, in Mrs. Jennings's house; but it was not a thing to be urged against the wishes of everybody. END
BEGIN NOW Their hours were therefore made over to Lady Middleton and the two Miss Steeles, by whom their company, in fact was as little valued, as it was professedly sought. END
BEGIN NOW They had too much sense to be desirable companions to the former; and by the latter they were considered with a jealous eye, as intruding on THEIR ground, and sharing the kindness which they wanted to monopolize. END
BEGIN NOW Though nothing could be more polite than Lady Middleton's behaviour to Elinor and Marianne, she did not really like them at all. END
BEGIN NOW Because they neither flattered herself nor her children, she could not believe them good-natured; and because they were fond of reading, she fancied them satirical: perhaps without exactly knowing what it was to be satirical; but THAT did not signify. END
BEGIN NOW It was censure in common use, and easily given. END
BEGIN NOW Their presence was a restraint both on her and on Lucy. END
BEGIN NOW It checked the idleness of one, and the business of the other. END
BEGIN NOW Lady Middleton was ashamed of doing nothing before them, and the flattery which Lucy was proud to think of and administer at other times, she feared they would despise her for offering. END
BEGIN NOW Miss Steele was the least discomposed of the three, by their presence; and it was in their power to reconcile her to it entirely. END
BEGIN NOW Would either of them only have given her a full and minute account of the whole affair between Marianne and Mr. Willoughby, she would have thought herself amply rewarded for the sacrifice of the best place by the fire after dinner, which their arrival occasioned. END
BEGIN NOW But this conciliation was not granted; for though she often threw out expressions of pity for her sister to Elinor, and more than once dropt a reflection on the inconstancy of beaux before Marianne, no effect was produced, but a look of indifference from the former, or of disgust in the latter. END
BEGIN NOW An effort even yet lighter might have made her their friend. END
BEGIN NOW Would they only have laughed at her about the Doctor! END
BEGIN NOW But so little were they, anymore than the others, inclined to oblige her, that if Sir John dined from home, she might spend a whole day without hearing any other raillery on the subject, than what she was kind enough to bestow on herself. END
BEGIN NOW All these jealousies and discontents, however, were so totally unsuspected by Mrs. Jennings, that she thought it a delightful thing for the girls to be together; and generally congratulated her young friends every night, on having escaped the company of a stupid old woman so long. END
BEGIN NOW She joined them sometimes at Sir John's, sometimes at her own house; but wherever it was, she always came in excellent spirits, full of delight and importance, attributing Charlotte's well doing to her own care, and ready to give so exact, so minute a detail of her situation, as only Miss Steele had curiosity enough to desire. END
BEGIN NOW One thing DID disturb her; and of that she made her daily complaint. END
BEGIN NOW Mr. Palmer maintained the common, but unfatherly opinion among his sex, of all infants being alike; and though she could plainly perceive, at different times, the most striking resemblance between this baby and every one of his relations on both sides, there was no convincing his father of it; no persuading him to believe that it was not exactly like every other baby of the same age; nor could he even be brought to acknowledge the simple proposition of its being the finest child in the world. END
BEGIN NOW I come now to the relation of a misfortune, which about this time befell Mrs. John Dashwood. END
BEGIN NOW It so happened that while her two sisters with Mrs. Jennings were first calling on her in Harley Street, another of her acquaintance had dropt in&mdash;a circumstance in itself not apparently likely to produce evil to her. END
BEGIN NOW But while the imaginations of other people will carry them away to form wrong judgments of our conduct, and to decide on it by slight appearances, one's happiness must in some measure be always at the mercy of chance. END
BEGIN NOW In the present instance, this last-arrived lady allowed her fancy to so far outrun truth and probability, that on merely hearing the name of the Miss Dashwoods, and understanding them to be Mr. Dashwood's sisters, she immediately concluded them to be staying in Harley Street; and this misconstruction produced within a day or two afterwards, cards of invitation for them as well as for their brother and sister, to a small musical party at her house. END
BEGIN NOW The consequence of which was, that Mrs. John Dashwood was obliged to submit not only to the exceedingly great inconvenience of sending her carriage for the Miss Dashwoods, but, what was still worse, must be subject to all the unpleasantness of appearing to treat them with attention: and who could tell that they might not expect to go out with her a second time? END
BEGIN NOW The power of disappointing them, it was true, must always be hers. END
BEGIN NOW But that was not enough; for when people are determined on a mode of conduct which they know to be wrong, they feel injured by the expectation of any thing better from them. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne had now been brought by degrees, so much into the habit of going out every day, that it was become a matter of indifference to her, whether she went or not: and she prepared quietly and mechanically for every evening's engagement, though without expecting the smallest amusement from any, and very often without knowing, till the last moment, where it was to take her. END
BEGIN NOW To her dress and appearance she was grown so perfectly indifferent, as not to bestow half the consideration on it, during the whole of her toilet, which it received from Miss Steele in the first five minutes of their being together, when it was finished. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing escaped HER minute observation and general curiosity; she saw every thing, and asked every thing; was never easy till she knew the price of every part of Marianne's dress; could have guessed the number of her gowns altogether with better judgment than Marianne herself, and was not without hopes of finding out before they parted, how much her washing cost per week, and how much she had every year to spend upon herself. END
BEGIN NOW The impertinence of these kind of scrutinies, moreover, was generally concluded with a compliment, which though meant as its douceur, was considered by Marianne as the greatest impertinence of all; for after undergoing an examination into the value and make of her gown, the colour of her shoes, and the arrangement of her hair, she was almost sure of being told that upon her word she looked vastly smart, and she dared to say she would make a great many conquests. END
BEGIN NOW With such encouragement as this, was she dismissed on the present occasion, to her brother's carriage; which they were ready to enter five minutes after it stopped at the door, a punctuality not very agreeable to their sister-in-law, who had preceded them to the house of her acquaintance, and was there hoping for some delay on their part that might inconvenience either herself or her coachman. END
BEGIN NOW The events of this evening were not very remarkable. END
BEGIN NOW The party, like other musical parties, comprehended a great many people who had real taste for the performance, and a great many more who had none at all; and the performers themselves were, as usual, in their own estimation, and that of their immediate friends, the first private performers in England. END
BEGIN NOW As Elinor was neither musical, nor affecting to be so, she made no scruple of turning her eyes from the grand pianoforte, whenever it suited her, and unrestrained even by the presence of a harp, and violoncello, would fix them at pleasure on any other object in the room. END
BEGIN NOW In one of these excursive glances she perceived among a group of young men, the very he, who had given them a lecture on toothpick-cases at Gray's. END
BEGIN NOW She perceived him soon afterwards looking at herself, and speaking familiarly to her brother; and had just determined to find out his name from the latter, when they both came towards her, and Mr. Dashwood introduced him to her as Mr. Robert Ferrars. END
BEGIN NOW He addressed her with easy civility, and twisted his head into a bow which assured her as plainly as words could have done, that he was exactly the coxcomb she had heard him described to be by Lucy. END
BEGIN NOW Happy had it been for her, if her regard for Edward had depended less on his own merit, than on the merit of his nearest relations! END
BEGIN NOW For then his brother's bow must have given the finishing stroke to what the ill-humour of his mother and sister would have begun. END
BEGIN NOW But while she wondered at the difference of the two young men, she did not find that the emptiness of conceit of the one, put her out of all charity with the modesty and worth of the other. END
BEGIN NOW Why they WERE different, Robert exclaimed to her himself in the course of a quarter of an hour's conversation; for, talking of his brother, and lamenting the extreme GAUCHERIE which he really believed kept him from mixing in proper society, he candidly and generously attributed it much less to any natural deficiency, than to the misfortune of a private education; while he himself, though probably without any particular, any material superiority by nature, merely from the advantage of a public school, was as well fitted to mix in the world as any other man. END
BEGIN NOW Upon my soul, he added, I believe it is nothing more; and so I often tell my mother, when she is grieving about it. END
BEGIN NOW 'My dear Madam,' I always say to her, 'you must make yourself easy. END
BEGIN NOW The evil is now irremediable, and it has been entirely your own doing. END
BEGIN NOW Why would you be persuaded by my uncle, Sir Robert, against your own judgment, to place Edward under private tuition, at the most critical time of his life? END
BEGIN NOW If you had only sent him to Westminster as well as myself, instead of sending him to Mr. Pratt's, all this would have been prevented.' END
BEGIN NOW This is the way in which I always consider the matter, and my mother is perfectly convinced of her error. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor would not oppose his opinion, because, whatever might be her general estimation of the advantage of a public school, she could not think of Edward's abode in Mr. Pratt's family, with any satisfaction. END
BEGIN NOW You reside in Devonshire, I think, &mdash;was his next observation, in a cottage near Dawlish. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor set him right as to its situation; and it seemed rather surprising to him that anybody could live in Devonshire, without living near Dawlish. END
BEGIN NOW He bestowed his hearty approbation however on their species of house. END
BEGIN NOW For my own part, said he, I am excessively fond of a cottage; there is always so much comfort, so much elegance about them. END
BEGIN NOW And I protest, if I had any money to spare, I should buy a little land and build one myself, within a short distance of London, where I might drive myself down at any time, and collect a few friends about me, and be happy. END
BEGIN NOW I advise every body who is going to build, to build a cottage. END
BEGIN NOW My friend Lord Courtland came to me the other day on purpose to ask my advice, and laid before me three different plans of Bonomi's. END
BEGIN NOW I was to decide on the best of them. END
BEGIN NOW 'My dear Courtland,' said I, immediately throwing them all into the fire, 'do not adopt either of them, but by all means build a cottage.' END
BEGIN NOW And that I fancy, will be the end of it. END
BEGIN NOW Some people imagine that there can be no accommodations, no space in a cottage; but this is all a mistake. END
BEGIN NOW I was last month at my friend Elliott's, near Dartford. END
BEGIN NOW Lady Elliott wished to give a dance. END
BEGIN NOW 'But how can it be done?' END
BEGIN NOW said she; 'my dear Ferrars, do tell me how it is to be managed. END
BEGIN NOW There is not a room in this cottage that will hold ten couple, and where can the supper be?' END
BEGIN NOW I immediately saw that there could be no difficulty in it, so I said, 'My dear Lady Elliott, do not be uneasy. END
BEGIN NOW The dining parlour will admit eighteen couple with ease; card-tables may be placed in the drawing-room; the library may be open for tea and other refreshments; and let the supper be set out in the saloon.' END
BEGIN NOW Lady Elliott was delighted with the thought. END
BEGIN NOW We measured the dining-room, and found it would hold exactly eighteen couple, and the affair was arranged precisely after my plan. END
BEGIN NOW So that, in fact, you see, if people do but know how to set about it, every comfort may be as well enjoyed in a cottage as in the most spacious dwelling. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor agreed to it all, for she did not think he deserved the compliment of rational opposition. END
BEGIN NOW As John Dashwood had no more pleasure in music than his eldest sister, his mind was equally at liberty to fix on any thing else; and a thought struck him during the evening, which he communicated to his wife, for her approbation, when they got home. END
BEGIN NOW The consideration of Mrs. Dennison's mistake, in supposing his sisters their guests, had suggested the propriety of their being really invited to become such, while Mrs. Jennings's engagements kept her from home. END
BEGIN NOW The expense would be nothing, the inconvenience not more; and it was altogether an attention which the delicacy of his conscience pointed out to be requisite to its complete enfranchisement from his promise to his father. END
BEGIN NOW Fanny was startled at the proposal. END
BEGIN NOW I do not see how it can be done, said she, without affronting Lady Middleton, for they spend every day with her; otherwise I should be exceedingly glad to do it. END
BEGIN NOW You know I am always ready to pay them any attention in my power, as my taking them out this evening shews. END
BEGIN NOW But they are Lady Middleton's visitors. END
BEGIN NOW How can I ask them away from her? END
BEGIN NOW Her husband, but with great humility, did not see the force of her objection. END
BEGIN NOW They had already spent a week in this manner in Conduit Street, and Lady Middleton could not be displeased at their giving the same number of days to such near relations. END
BEGIN NOW Fanny paused a moment, and then, with fresh vigor, said, My love I would ask them with all my heart, if it was in my power. END
BEGIN NOW But I had just settled within myself to ask the Miss Steeles to spend a few days with us. END
BEGIN NOW They are very well behaved, good kind of girls; and I think the attention is due to them, as their uncle did so very well by Edward. END
BEGIN NOW We can ask your sisters some other year, you know; but the Miss Steeles may not be in town any more. END
BEGIN NOW I am sure you will like them; indeed, you DO like them, you know, very much already, and so does my mother; and they are such favourites with Harry! END
BEGIN NOW Mr. Dashwood was convinced. END
BEGIN NOW He saw the necessity of inviting the Miss Steeles immediately, and his conscience was pacified by the resolution of inviting his sisters another year; at the same time, however, slyly suspecting that another year would make the invitation needless, by bringing Elinor to town as Colonel Brandon's wife, and Marianne as THEIR visitor. END
BEGIN NOW Fanny, rejoicing in her escape, and proud of the ready wit that had procured it, wrote the next morning to Lucy, to request her company and her sister's, for some days, in Harley Street, as soon as Lady Middleton could spare them. END
BEGIN NOW This was enough to make Lucy really and reasonably happy. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Dashwood seemed actually working for her, herself; cherishing all her hopes, and promoting all her views! END
BEGIN NOW Such an opportunity of being with Edward and his family was, above all things, the most material to her interest, and such an invitation the most gratifying to her feelings! END
BEGIN NOW It was an advantage that could not be too gratefully acknowledged, nor too speedily made use of; and the visit to Lady Middleton, which had not before had any precise limits, was instantly discovered to have been always meant to end in two days' time. END
BEGIN NOW When the note was shown to Elinor, as it was within ten minutes after its arrival, it gave her, for the first time, some share in the expectations of Lucy; for such a mark of uncommon kindness, vouchsafed on so short an acquaintance, seemed to declare that the good-will towards her arose from something more than merely malice against herself; and might be brought, by time and address, to do every thing that Lucy wished. END
BEGIN NOW Her flattery had already subdued the pride of Lady Middleton, and made an entry into the close heart of Mrs. John Dashwood; and these were effects that laid open the probability of greater. END
BEGIN NOW The Miss Steeles removed to Harley Street, and all that reached Elinor of their influence there, strengthened her expectation of the event. END
BEGIN NOW Sir John, who called on them more than once, brought home such accounts of the favour they were in, as must be universally striking. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Dashwood had never been so much pleased with any young women in her life, as she was with them; had given each of them a needle book made by some emigrant; called Lucy by her Christian name; and did not know whether she should ever be able to part with them. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Palmer was so well at the end of a fortnight, that her mother felt it no longer necessary to give up the whole of her time to her; and, contenting herself with visiting her once or twice a day, returned from that period to her own home, and her own habits, in which she found the Miss Dashwoods very ready to resume their former share. END
BEGIN NOW About the third or fourth morning after their being thus resettled in Berkeley Street, Mrs. Jennings, on returning from her ordinary visit to Mrs. Palmer, entered the drawing-room, where Elinor was sitting by herself, with an air of such hurrying importance as prepared her to hear something wonderful; and giving her time only to form that idea, began directly to justify it, by saying, Lord! END
BEGIN NOW my dear Miss Dashwood! END
BEGIN NOW have you heard the news? END
BEGIN NOW No, ma'am. END
BEGIN NOW What is it? END
BEGIN NOW Something so strange! END
BEGIN NOW But you shall hear it all.&mdash; When I got to Mr. Palmer's, I found Charlotte quite in a fuss about the child. END
BEGIN NOW She was sure it was very ill&mdash;it cried, and fretted, and was all over pimples. END
BEGIN NOW So I looked at it directly, and, 'Lord! END
BEGIN NOW my dear,' says I, 'it is nothing in the world, but the red gum&mdash;' and nurse said just the same. END
BEGIN NOW But Charlotte, she would not be satisfied, so Mr. Donavan was sent for; and luckily he happened to just come in from Harley Street, so he stepped over directly, and as soon as ever Mama, he said just as we did, that it was nothing in the world but the red gum, and then Charlotte was easy. END
BEGIN NOW And so, just as he was going away again, it came into my head, I am sure I do not know how I happened to think of it, but it came into my head to ask him if there was any news. END
BEGIN NOW So upon that, he smirked, and simpered, and looked grave, and seemed to know something or other, and at last he said in a whisper, 'For fear any unpleasant report should reach the young ladies under your care as to their sister's indisposition, I think it advisable to say, that I believe there is no great reason for alarm; I hope Mrs. Dashwood will do very well.' END
BEGIN NOW What! END
BEGIN NOW is Fanny ill? END
BEGIN NOW That is exactly what I said, my dear. END
BEGIN NOW 'Lord!' END
BEGIN NOW says I, 'is Mrs. Dashwood ill?' END
BEGIN NOW So then it all came out; and the long and the short of the matter, by all I can learn, seems to be this. END
BEGIN NOW Mr. Edward Ferrars, the very young man I used to joke with you about (but however, as it turns out, I am monstrous glad there was never any thing in it), Mr. Edward Ferrars, it seems, has been engaged above this twelvemonth to my cousin Lucy!&mdash;There's for you, my dear!&mdash;And not a creature knowing a syllable of the matter, except Nancy!&mdash;Could you have believed such a thing possible?&mdash; There is no great wonder in their liking one another; but that matters should be brought so forward between them, and nobody suspect it!&mdash;THAT is strange!&mdash;I never happened to see them together, or I am sure I should have found it out directly. END
BEGIN NOW Well, and so this was kept a great secret, for fear of Mrs. Ferrars, and neither she nor your brother or sister suspected a word of the matter;&mdash;till this very morning, poor Nancy, who, you know, is a well-meaning creature, but no conjurer, popt it all out. END
BEGIN NOW 'Lord!' END
BEGIN NOW thinks she to herself, 'they are all so fond of Lucy, to be sure they will make no difficulty about it;' and so, away she went to your sister, who was sitting all alone at her carpet-work, little suspecting what was to come&mdash;for she had just been saying to your brother, only five minutes before, that she thought to make a match between Edward and some Lord's daughter or other, I forget who. END
BEGIN NOW So you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity and pride. END
BEGIN NOW She fell into violent hysterics immediately, with such screams as reached your brother's ears, as he was sitting in his own dressing-room down stairs, thinking about writing a letter to his steward in the country. END
BEGIN NOW So up he flew directly, and a terrible scene took place, for Lucy was come to them by that time, little dreaming what was going on. END
BEGIN NOW Poor soul! END
BEGIN NOW I pity HER. END
BEGIN NOW And I must say, I think she was used very hardly; for your sister scolded like any fury, and soon drove her into a fainting fit. END
BEGIN NOW Nancy, she fell upon her knees, and cried bitterly; and your brother, he walked about the room, and said he did not know what to do. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Dashwood declared they should not stay a minute longer in the house, and your brother was forced to go down upon HIS knees too, to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed up their clothes. END
BEGIN NOW THEN she fell into hysterics again, and he was so frightened that he would send for Mr. Donavan, and Mr. Donavan found the house in all this uproar. END
BEGIN NOW The carriage was at the door ready to take my poor cousins away, and they were just stepping in as he came off; poor Lucy in such a condition, he says, she could hardly walk; and Nancy, she was almost as bad. END
BEGIN NOW I declare, I have no patience with your sister; and I hope, with all my heart, it will be a match in spite of her. END
BEGIN NOW Lord! END
BEGIN NOW what a taking poor Mr. Edward will be in when he hears of it! END
BEGIN NOW To have his love used so scornfully! END
BEGIN NOW for they say he is monstrous fond of her, as well he may. END
BEGIN NOW I should not wonder, if he was to be in the greatest passion!&mdash;and Mr. Donavan thinks just the same. END
BEGIN NOW He and I had a great deal of talk about it; and the best of all is, that he is gone back again to Harley Street, that he may be within call when Mrs. Ferrars is told of it, for she was sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the house, for your sister was sure SHE would be in hysterics too; and so she may, for what I care. END
BEGIN NOW I have no pity for either of them. END
BEGIN NOW I have no notion of people's making such a to-do about money and greatness. END
BEGIN NOW There is no reason on earth why Mr. Edward and Lucy should not marry; for I am sure Mrs. Ferrars may afford to do very well by her son, and though Lucy has next to nothing herself, she knows better than any body how to make the most of every thing; I dare say, if Mrs. Ferrars would only allow him five hundred a-year, she would make as good an appearance with it as any body else would with eight. END
BEGIN NOW Lord! END
BEGIN NOW how snug they might live in such another cottage as yours&mdash;or a little bigger&mdash;with two maids, and two men; and I believe I could help them to a housemaid, for my Betty has a sister out of place, that would fit them exactly. END
BEGIN NOW Here Mrs. Jennings ceased, and as Elinor had had time enough to collect her thoughts, she was able to give such an answer, and make such observations, as the subject might naturally be supposed to produce. END
BEGIN NOW Happy to find that she was not suspected of any extraordinary interest in it; that Mrs. Jennings (as she had of late often hoped might be the case) had ceased to imagine her at all attached to Edward; and happy above all the rest, in the absence of Marianne, she felt very well able to speak of the affair without embarrassment, and to give her judgment, as she believed, with impartiality on the conduct of every one concerned in it. END
BEGIN NOW She could hardly determine what her own expectation of its event really was; though she earnestly tried to drive away the notion of its being possible to end otherwise at last, than in the marriage of Edward and Lucy. END
BEGIN NOW What Mrs. Ferrars would say and do, though there could not be a doubt of its nature, she was anxious to hear; and still more anxious to know how Edward would conduct himself. END
BEGIN NOW For HIM she felt much compassion;&mdash;for Lucy very little&mdash;and it cost her some pains to procure that little;&mdash;for the rest of the party none at all. END
BEGIN NOW As Mrs. Jennings could talk on no other subject, Elinor soon saw the necessity of preparing Marianne for its discussion. END
BEGIN NOW No time was to be lost in undeceiving her, in making her acquainted with the real truth, and in endeavouring to bring her to hear it talked of by others, without betraying that she felt any uneasiness for her sister, or any resentment against Edward. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor's office was a painful one.&mdash;She was going to remove what she really believed to be her sister's chief consolation,&mdash;to give such particulars of Edward as she feared would ruin him for ever in her good opinion,-and to make Marianne, by a resemblance in their situations, which to HER fancy would seem strong, feel all her own disappointment over again. END
BEGIN NOW But unwelcome as such a task must be, it was necessary to be done, and Elinor therefore hastened to perform it. END
BEGIN NOW She was very far from wishing to dwell on her own feelings, or to represent herself as suffering much, any otherwise than as the self-command she had practised since her first knowledge of Edward's engagement, might suggest a hint of what was practicable to Marianne. END
BEGIN NOW Her narration was clear and simple; and though it could not be given without emotion, it was not accompanied by violent agitation, nor impetuous grief.&mdash;THAT belonged rather to the hearer, for Marianne listened with horror, and cried excessively. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor was to be the comforter of others in her own distresses, no less than in theirs; and all the comfort that could be given by assurances of her own composure of mind, and a very earnest vindication of Edward from every charge but of imprudence, was readily offered. END
BEGIN NOW But Marianne for some time would give credit to neither. END
BEGIN NOW Edward seemed a second Willoughby; and acknowledging as Elinor did, that she HAD loved him most sincerely, could she feel less than herself! END
BEGIN NOW As for Lucy Steele, she considered her so totally unamiable, so absolutely incapable of attaching a sensible man, that she could not be persuaded at first to believe, and afterwards to pardon, any former affection of Edward for her. END
BEGIN NOW She would not even admit it to have been natural; and Elinor left her to be convinced that it was so, by that which only could convince her, a better knowledge of mankind. END
BEGIN NOW Her first communication had reached no farther than to state the fact of the engagement, and the length of time it had existed.&mdash;Marianne's feelings had then broken in, and put an end to all regularity of detail; and for some time all that could be done was to soothe her distress, lessen her alarms, and combat her resentment. END
BEGIN NOW The first question on her side, which led to farther particulars, was,&mdash; How long has this been known to you, Elinor? END
BEGIN NOW has he written to you? END
BEGIN NOW I have known it these four months. END
BEGIN NOW When Lucy first came to Barton Park last November, she told me in confidence of her engagement. END
BEGIN NOW At these words, Marianne's eyes expressed the astonishment which her lips could not utter. END
BEGIN NOW After a pause of wonder, she exclaimed&mdash; Four months!&mdash;Have you known of this four months? END
BEGIN NOW Elinor confirmed it. END
BEGIN NOW What!&mdash;while attending me in all my misery, has this been on your heart?&mdash;And I have reproached you for being happy! END
BEGIN NOW &mdash; It was not fit that you should then know how much I was the reverse! END
BEGIN NOW Four months! END
BEGIN NOW &mdash;cried Marianne again.&mdash; So calm!&mdash;so cheerful!&mdash;how have you been supported? END
BEGIN NOW &mdash; By feeling that I was doing my duty.&mdash;My promise to Lucy, obliged me to be secret. END
BEGIN NOW I owed it to her, therefore, to avoid giving any hint of the truth; and I owed it to my family and friends, not to create in them a solicitude about me, which it could not be in my power to satisfy. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne seemed much struck. END
BEGIN NOW I have very often wished to undeceive yourself and my mother, added Elinor; and once or twice I have attempted it;&mdash;but without betraying my trust, I never could have convinced you. END
BEGIN NOW Four months!&mdash;and yet you loved him! END
BEGIN NOW &mdash; Yes. END
BEGIN NOW But I did not love only him;&mdash;and while the comfort of others was dear to me, I was glad to spare them from knowing how much I felt. END
BEGIN NOW Now, I can think and speak of it with little emotion. END
BEGIN NOW I would not have you suffer on my account; for I assure you I no longer suffer materially myself. END
BEGIN NOW I have many things to support me. END
BEGIN NOW I am not conscious of having provoked the disappointment by any imprudence of my own, I have borne it as much as possible without spreading it farther. END
BEGIN NOW I acquit Edward of essential misconduct. END
BEGIN NOW I wish him very happy; and I am so sure of his always doing his duty, that though now he may harbour some regret, in the end he must become so. END
BEGIN NOW Lucy does not want sense, and that is the foundation on which every thing good may be built.&mdash;And after all, Marianne, after all that is bewitching in the idea of a single and constant attachment, and all that can be said of one's happiness depending entirely on any particular person, it is not meant&mdash;it is not fit&mdash;it is not possible that it should be so.&mdash; Edward will marry Lucy; he will marry a woman superior in person and understanding to half her sex; and time and habit will teach him to forget that he ever thought another superior to HER. END
BEGIN NOW &mdash; If such is your way of thinking, said Marianne, if the loss of what is most valued is so easily to be made up by something else, your resolution, your self-command, are, perhaps, a little less to be wondered at.&mdash;They are brought more within my comprehension. END
BEGIN NOW I understand you.&mdash;You do not suppose that I have ever felt much.&mdash;For four months, Marianne, I have had all this hanging on my mind, without being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature; knowing that it would make you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained to you, yet unable to prepare you for it in the least.&mdash; It was told me,&mdash;it was in a manner forced on me by the very person herself, whose prior engagement ruined all my prospects; and told me, as I thought, with triumph.&mdash; This person's suspicions, therefore, I have had to oppose, by endeavouring to appear indifferent where I have been most deeply interested;&mdash;and it has not been only once;&mdash;I have had her hopes and exultation to listen to again and again.&mdash; I have known myself to be divided from Edward for ever, without hearing one circumstance that could make me less desire the connection.&mdash;Nothing has proved him unworthy; nor has anything declared him indifferent to me.&mdash; I have had to contend against the unkindness of his sister, and the insolence of his mother; and have suffered the punishment of an attachment, without enjoying its advantages.&mdash; And all this has been going on at a time, when, as you know too well, it has not been my only unhappiness.&mdash; If you can think me capable of ever feeling&mdash;surely you may suppose that I have suffered NOW. END
BEGIN NOW The composure of mind with which I have brought myself at present to consider the matter, the consolation that I have been willing to admit, have been the effect of constant and painful exertion;&mdash;they did not spring up of themselves;&mdash;they did not occur to relieve my spirits at first.&mdash; No, Marianne.&mdash;THEN, if I had not been bound to silence, perhaps nothing could have kept me entirely&mdash;not even what I owed to my dearest friends&mdash;from openly shewing that I was VERY unhappy. END
BEGIN NOW &mdash; Marianne was quite subdued.&mdash; Oh! END
BEGIN NOW Elinor, she cried, you have made me hate myself for ever.&mdash;How barbarous have I been to you!&mdash;you, who have been my only comfort, who have borne with me in all my misery, who have seemed to be only suffering for me!&mdash;Is this my gratitude?&mdash;Is this the only return I can make you?&mdash;Because your merit cries out upon myself, I have been trying to do it away. END
BEGIN NOW The tenderest caresses followed this confession. END
BEGIN NOW In such a frame of mind as she was now in, Elinor had no difficulty in obtaining from her whatever promise she required; and at her request, Marianne engaged never to speak of the affair to any one with the least appearance of bitterness;&mdash;to meet Lucy without betraying the smallest increase of dislike to her;&mdash;and even to see Edward himself, if chance should bring them together, without any diminution of her usual cordiality.&mdash; These were great concessions;&mdash;but where Marianne felt that she had injured, no reparation could be too much for her to make. END
BEGIN NOW She performed her promise of being discreet, to admiration.&mdash;She attended to all that Mrs. Jennings had to say upon the subject, with an unchanging complexion, dissented from her in nothing, and was heard three times to say, Yes, ma'am. END
BEGIN NOW &mdash;She listened to her praise of Lucy with only moving from one chair to another, and when Mrs. Jennings talked of Edward's affection, it cost her only a spasm in her throat.&mdash;Such advances towards heroism in her sister, made Elinor feel equal to any thing herself. END
BEGIN NOW The next morning brought a farther trial of it, in a visit from their brother, who came with a most serious aspect to talk over the dreadful affair, and bring them news of his wife. END
BEGIN NOW You have heard, I suppose, said he with great solemnity, as soon as he was seated, of the very shocking discovery that took place under our roof yesterday. END
BEGIN NOW They all looked their assent; it seemed too awful a moment for speech. END
BEGIN NOW Your sister, he continued, has suffered dreadfully. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Ferrars too&mdash;in short it has been a scene of such complicated distress&mdash;but I will hope that the storm may be weathered without our being any of us quite overcome. END
BEGIN NOW Poor Fanny! END
BEGIN NOW she was in hysterics all yesterday. END
BEGIN NOW But I would not alarm you too much. END
BEGIN NOW Donavan says there is nothing materially to be apprehended; her constitution is a good one, and her resolution equal to any thing. END
BEGIN NOW She has borne it all, with the fortitude of an angel! END
BEGIN NOW She says she never shall think well of anybody again; and one cannot wonder at it, after being so deceived!&mdash;meeting with such ingratitude, where so much kindness had been shewn, so much confidence had been placed! END
BEGIN NOW It was quite out of the benevolence of her heart, that she had asked these young women to her house; merely because she thought they deserved some attention, were harmless, well-behaved girls, and would be pleasant companions; for otherwise we both wished very much to have invited you and Marianne to be with us, while your kind friend there, was attending her daughter. END
BEGIN NOW And now to be so rewarded! END
BEGIN NOW 'I wish, with all my heart,' says poor Fanny in her affectionate way, 'that we had asked your sisters instead of them.' END
BEGIN NOW Here he stopped to be thanked; which being done, he went on. END
BEGIN NOW What poor Mrs. Ferrars suffered, when first Fanny broke it to her, is not to be described. END
BEGIN NOW While she with the truest affection had been planning a most eligible connection for him, was it to be supposed that he could be all the time secretly engaged to another person!&mdash;such a suspicion could never have entered her head! END
BEGIN NOW If she suspected ANY prepossession elsewhere, it could not be in THAT quarter. END
BEGIN NOW 'THERE, to be sure,' said she, 'I might have thought myself safe.' END
BEGIN NOW She was quite in an agony. END
BEGIN NOW We consulted together, however, as to what should be done, and at last she determined to send for Edward. END
BEGIN NOW He came. END
BEGIN NOW But I am sorry to relate what ensued. END
BEGIN NOW All that Mrs. Ferrars could say to make him put an end to the engagement, assisted too as you may well suppose by my arguments, and Fanny's entreaties, was of no avail. END
BEGIN NOW Duty, affection, every thing was disregarded. END
BEGIN NOW I never thought Edward so stubborn, so unfeeling before. END
BEGIN NOW His mother explained to him her liberal designs, in case of his marrying Miss Morton; told him she would settle on him the Norfolk estate, which, clear of land-tax, brings in a good thousand a-year; offered even, when matters grew desperate, to make it twelve hundred; and in opposition to this, if he still persisted in this low connection, represented to him the certain penury that must attend the match. END
BEGIN NOW His own two thousand pounds she protested should be his all; she would never see him again; and so far would she be from affording him the smallest assistance, that if he were to enter into any profession with a view of better support, she would do all in her power to prevent him advancing in it. END
BEGIN NOW Here Marianne, in an ecstasy of indignation, clapped her hands together, and cried, Gracious God! END
BEGIN NOW can this be possible! END
BEGIN NOW Well may you wonder, Marianne, replied her brother, at the obstinacy which could resist such arguments as these. END
BEGIN NOW Your exclamation is very natural. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne was going to retort, but she remembered her promises, and forbore. END
BEGIN NOW All this, however, he continued, was urged in vain. END
BEGIN NOW Edward said very little; but what he did say, was in the most determined manner. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing should prevail on him to give up his engagement. END
BEGIN NOW He would stand to it, cost him what it might. END
BEGIN NOW Then, cried Mrs. Jennings with blunt sincerity, no longer able to be silent, he has acted like an honest man! END
BEGIN NOW I beg your pardon, Mr. Dashwood, but if he had done otherwise, I should have thought him a rascal. END
BEGIN NOW I have some little concern in the business, as well as yourself, for Lucy Steele is my cousin, and I believe there is not a better kind of girl in the world, nor one who more deserves a good husband. END
BEGIN NOW John Dashwood was greatly astonished; but his nature was calm, not open to provocation, and he never wished to offend anybody, especially anybody of good fortune. END
BEGIN NOW He therefore replied, without any resentment, I would by no means speak disrespectfully of any relation of yours, madam. END
BEGIN NOW Miss Lucy Steele is, I dare say, a very deserving young woman, but in the present case you know, the connection must be impossible. END
BEGIN NOW And to have entered into a secret engagement with a young man under her uncle's care, the son of a woman especially of such very large fortune as Mrs. Ferrars, is perhaps, altogether a little extraordinary. END
BEGIN NOW In short, I do not mean to reflect upon the behaviour of any person whom you have a regard for, Mrs. Jennings. END
BEGIN NOW We all wish her extremely happy; and Mrs. Ferrars's conduct throughout the whole, has been such as every conscientious, good mother, in like circumstances, would adopt. END
BEGIN NOW It has been dignified and liberal. END
BEGIN NOW Edward has drawn his own lot, and I fear it will be a bad one. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne sighed out her similar apprehension; and Elinor's heart wrung for the feelings of Edward, while braving his mother's threats, for a woman who could not reward him. END
BEGIN NOW Well, sir, said Mrs. Jennings, and how did it end? END
BEGIN NOW I am sorry to say, ma'am, in a most unhappy rupture:&mdash; Edward is dismissed for ever from his mother's notice. END
BEGIN NOW He left her house yesterday, but where he is gone, or whether he is still in town, I do not know; for WE of course can make no inquiry. END
BEGIN NOW Poor young man!&mdash;and what is to become of him? END
BEGIN NOW What, indeed, ma'am! END
BEGIN NOW It is a melancholy consideration. END
BEGIN NOW Born to the prospect of such affluence! END
BEGIN NOW I cannot conceive a situation more deplorable. END
BEGIN NOW The interest of two thousand pounds&mdash;how can a man live on it?&mdash;and when to that is added the recollection, that he might, but for his own folly, within three months have been in the receipt of two thousand, five hundred a-year (for Miss Morton has thirty thousand pounds,) I cannot picture to myself a more wretched condition. END
BEGIN NOW We must all feel for him; and the more so, because it is totally out of our power to assist him. END
BEGIN NOW Poor young man! END
BEGIN NOW cried Mrs. Jennings, I am sure he should be very welcome to bed and board at my house; and so I would tell him if I could see him. END
BEGIN NOW It is not fit that he should be living about at his own charge now, at lodgings and taverns. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor's heart thanked her for such kindness towards Edward, though she could not forbear smiling at the form of it. END
BEGIN NOW If he would only have done as well by himself, said John Dashwood, as all his friends were disposed to do by him, he might now have been in his proper situation, and would have wanted for nothing. END
BEGIN NOW But as it is, it must be out of anybody's power to assist him. END
BEGIN NOW And there is one thing more preparing against him, which must be worse than all&mdash;his mother has determined, with a very natural kind of spirit, to settle THAT estate upon Robert immediately, which might have been Edward's, on proper conditions. END
BEGIN NOW I left her this morning with her lawyer, talking over the business. END
BEGIN NOW Well! END
BEGIN NOW said Mrs. Jennings, that is HER revenge. END
BEGIN NOW Everybody has a way of their own. END
BEGIN NOW But I don't think mine would be, to make one son independent, because another had plagued me. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne got up and walked about the room. END
BEGIN NOW Can anything be more galling to the spirit of a man, continued John, than to see his younger brother in possession of an estate which might have been his own? END
BEGIN NOW Poor Edward! END
BEGIN NOW I feel for him sincerely. END
BEGIN NOW A few minutes more spent in the same kind of effusion, concluded his visit; and with repeated assurances to his sisters that he really believed there was no material danger in Fanny's indisposition, and that they need not therefore be very uneasy about it, he went away; leaving the three ladies unanimous in their sentiments on the present occasion, as far at least as it regarded Mrs. Ferrars's conduct, the Dashwoods', and Edward's. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne's indignation burst forth as soon as he quitted the room; and as her vehemence made reserve impossible in Elinor, and unnecessary in Mrs. Jennings, they all joined in a very spirited critique upon the party. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Jennings was very warm in her praise of Edward's conduct, but only Elinor and Marianne understood its true merit. END
BEGIN NOW THEY only knew how little he had had to tempt him to be disobedient, and how small was the consolation, beyond the consciousness of doing right, that could remain to him in the loss of friends and fortune. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor gloried in his integrity; and Marianne forgave all his offences in compassion for his punishment. END
BEGIN NOW But though confidence between them was, by this public discovery, restored to its proper state, it was not a subject on which either of them were fond of dwelling when alone. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor avoided it upon principle, as tending to fix still more upon her thoughts, by the too warm, too positive assurances of Marianne, that belief of Edward's continued affection for herself which she rather wished to do away; and Marianne's courage soon failed her, in trying to converse upon a topic which always left her more dissatisfied with herself than ever, by the comparison it necessarily produced between Elinor's conduct and her own. END
BEGIN NOW She felt all the force of that comparison; but not as her sister had hoped, to urge her to exertion now; she felt it with all the pain of continual self-reproach, regretted most bitterly that she had never exerted herself before; but it brought only the torture of penitence, without the hope of amendment. END
BEGIN NOW Her mind was so much weakened that she still fancied present exertion impossible, and therefore it only dispirited her more. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing new was heard by them, for a day or two afterwards, of affairs in Harley Street, or Bartlett's Buildings. END
BEGIN NOW But though so much of the matter was known to them already, that Mrs. Jennings might have had enough to do in spreading that knowledge farther, without seeking after more, she had resolved from the first to pay a visit of comfort and inquiry to her cousins as soon as she could; and nothing but the hindrance of more visitors than usual, had prevented her going to them within that time. END
BEGIN NOW The third day succeeding their knowledge of the particulars, was so fine, so beautiful a Sunday as to draw many to Kensington Gardens, though it was only the second week in March. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Jennings and Elinor were of the number; but Marianne, who knew that the Willoughbys were again in town, and had a constant dread of meeting them, chose rather to stay at home, than venture into so public a place. END
BEGIN NOW An intimate acquaintance of Mrs. Jennings joined them soon after they entered the Gardens, and Elinor was not sorry that by her continuing with them, and engaging all Mrs. Jennings's conversation, she was herself left to quiet reflection. END
BEGIN NOW She saw nothing of the Willoughbys, nothing of Edward, and for some time nothing of anybody who could by any chance whether grave or gay, be interesting to her. END
BEGIN NOW But at last she found herself with some surprise, accosted by Miss Steele, who, though looking rather shy, expressed great satisfaction in meeting them, and on receiving encouragement from the particular kindness of Mrs. Jennings, left her own party for a short time, to join their's. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Jennings immediately whispered to Elinor, Get it all out of her, my dear. END
BEGIN NOW She will tell you any thing if you ask. END
BEGIN NOW You see I cannot leave Mrs. Clarke. END
BEGIN NOW It was lucky, however, for Mrs. Jennings's curiosity and Elinor's too, that she would tell any thing WITHOUT being asked; for nothing would otherwise have been learnt. END
BEGIN NOW I am so glad to meet you; said Miss Steele, taking her familiarly by the arm&mdash; for I wanted to see you of all things in the world. END
BEGIN NOW And then lowering her voice, I suppose Mrs. Jennings has heard all about it. END
BEGIN NOW Is she angry? END
BEGIN NOW Not at all, I believe, with you. END
BEGIN NOW That is a good thing. END
BEGIN NOW And Lady Middleton, is SHE angry? END
BEGIN NOW I cannot suppose it possible that she should be. END
BEGIN NOW I am monstrous glad of it. END
BEGIN NOW Good gracious! END
BEGIN NOW I have had such a time of it! END
BEGIN NOW I never saw Lucy in such a rage in my life. END
BEGIN NOW She vowed at first she would never trim me up a new bonnet, nor do any thing else for me again, so long as she lived; but now she is quite come to, and we are as good friends as ever. END
BEGIN NOW Look, she made me this bow to my hat, and put in the feather last night. END
BEGIN NOW There now, YOU are going to laugh at me too. END
BEGIN NOW But why should not I wear pink ribbons? END
BEGIN NOW I do not care if it IS the Doctor's favourite colour. END
BEGIN NOW I am sure, for my part, I should never have known he DID like it better than any other colour, if he had not happened to say so. END
BEGIN NOW My cousins have been so plaguing me! END
BEGIN NOW I declare sometimes I do not know which way to look before them. END
BEGIN NOW She had wandered away to a subject on which Elinor had nothing to say, and therefore soon judged it expedient to find her way back again to the first. END
BEGIN NOW Well, but Miss Dashwood, speaking triumphantly, people may say what they chuse about Mr. Ferrars's declaring he would not have Lucy, for it is no such thing I can tell you; and it is quite a shame for such ill-natured reports to be spread abroad. END
BEGIN NOW Whatever Lucy might think about it herself, you know, it was no business of other people to set it down for certain. END
BEGIN NOW I never heard any thing of the kind hinted at before, I assure you, said Elinor. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, did not you? END
BEGIN NOW But it WAS said, I know, very well, and by more than one; for Miss Godby told Miss Sparks, that nobody in their senses could expect Mr. Ferrars to give up a woman like Miss Morton, with thirty thousand pounds to her fortune, for Lucy Steele that had nothing at all; and I had it from Miss Sparks myself. END
BEGIN NOW And besides that, my cousin Richard said himself, that when it came to the point he was afraid Mr. Ferrars would be off; and when Edward did not come near us for three days, I could not tell what to think myself; and I believe in my heart Lucy gave it up all for lost; for we came away from your brother's Wednesday, and we saw nothing of him not all Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, and did not know what was become of him. END
BEGIN NOW Once Lucy thought to write to him, but then her spirits rose against that. END
BEGIN NOW However this morning he came just as we came home from church; and then it all came out, how he had been sent for Wednesday to Harley Street, and been talked to by his mother and all of them, and how he had declared before them all that he loved nobody but Lucy, and nobody but Lucy would he have. END
BEGIN NOW And how he had been so worried by what passed, that as soon as he had went away from his mother's house, he had got upon his horse, and rid into the country, some where or other; and how he had stayed about at an inn all Thursday and Friday, on purpose to get the better of it. END
BEGIN NOW And after thinking it all over and over again, he said, it seemed to him as if, now he had no fortune, and no nothing at all, it would be quite unkind to keep her on to the engagement, because it must be for her loss, for he had nothing but two thousand pounds, and no hope of any thing else; and if he was to go into orders, as he had some thoughts, he could get nothing but a curacy, and how was they to live upon that?&mdash;He could not bear to think of her doing no better, and so he begged, if she had the least mind for it, to put an end to the matter directly, and leave him shift for himself. END
BEGIN NOW I heard him say all this as plain as could possibly be. END
BEGIN NOW And it was entirely for HER sake, and upon HER account, that he said a word about being off, and not upon his own. END
BEGIN NOW I will take my oath he never dropt a syllable of being tired of her, or of wishing to marry Miss Morton, or any thing like it. END
BEGIN NOW But, to be sure, Lucy would not give ear to such kind of talking; so she told him directly (with a great deal about sweet and love, you know, and all that&mdash;Oh, la! END
BEGIN NOW one can't repeat such kind of things you know)&mdash;she told him directly, she had not the least mind in the world to be off, for she could live with him upon a trifle, and how little so ever he might have, she should be very glad to have it all, you know, or something of the kind. END
BEGIN NOW So then he was monstrous happy, and talked on some time about what they should do, and they agreed he should take orders directly, and they must wait to be married till he got a living. END
BEGIN NOW And just then I could not hear any more, for my cousin called from below to tell me Mrs. Richardson was come in her coach, and would take one of us to Kensington Gardens; so I was forced to go into the room and interrupt them, to ask Lucy if she would like to go, but she did not care to leave Edward; so I just run up stairs and put on a pair of silk stockings and came off with the Richardsons. END
BEGIN NOW I do not understand what you mean by interrupting them, said Elinor; you were all in the same room together, were not you? END
BEGIN NOW No, indeed, not us. END
BEGIN NOW La! END
BEGIN NOW Miss Dashwood, do you think people make love when any body else is by? END
BEGIN NOW Oh, for shame!&mdash;To be sure you must know better than that. END
BEGIN NOW (Laughing affectedly. END
BEGIN NOW )&mdash;No, no; they were shut up in the drawing-room together, and all I heard was only by listening at the door. END
BEGIN NOW How! END
BEGIN NOW cried Elinor; have you been repeating to me what you only learnt yourself by listening at the door? END
BEGIN NOW I am sorry I did not know it before; for I certainly would not have suffered you to give me particulars of a conversation which you ought not to have known yourself. END
BEGIN NOW How could you behave so unfairly by your sister? END
BEGIN NOW Oh, la! END
BEGIN NOW there is nothing in THAT. END
BEGIN NOW I only stood at the door, and heard what I could. END
BEGIN NOW And I am sure Lucy would have done just the same by me; for a year or two back, when Martha Sharpe and I had so many secrets together, she never made any bones of hiding in a closet, or behind a chimney-board, on purpose to hear what we said. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor tried to talk of something else; but Miss Steele could not be kept beyond a couple of minutes, from what was uppermost in her mind. END
BEGIN NOW Edward talks of going to Oxford soon, said she; but now he is lodging at No. END
BEGIN NOW &mdash;, Pall Mall. END
BEGIN NOW What an ill-natured woman his mother is, an't she? END
BEGIN NOW And your brother and sister were not very kind! END
BEGIN NOW However, I shan't say anything against them to YOU; and to be sure they did send us home in their own chariot, which was more than I looked for. END
BEGIN NOW And for my part, I was all in a fright for fear your sister should ask us for the huswifes she had gave us a day or two before; but, however, nothing was said about them, and I took care to keep mine out of sight. END
BEGIN NOW Edward have got some business at Oxford, he says; so he must go there for a time; and after THAT, as soon as he can light upon a Bishop, he will be ordained. END
BEGIN NOW I wonder what curacy he will get!&mdash;Good gracious! END
BEGIN NOW (giggling as she spoke) I'd lay my life I know what my cousins will say, when they hear of it. END
BEGIN NOW They will tell me I should write to the Doctor, to get Edward the curacy of his new living. END
BEGIN NOW I know they will; but I am sure I would not do such a thing for all the world.&mdash; 'La!' END
BEGIN NOW I shall say directly, 'I wonder how you could think of such a thing? END
BEGIN NOW I write to the Doctor, indeed!' END
BEGIN NOW Well, said Elinor, it is a comfort to be prepared against the worst. END
BEGIN NOW You have got your answer ready. END
BEGIN NOW Miss Steele was going to reply on the same subject, but the approach of her own party made another more necessary. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, la! END
BEGIN NOW here come the Richardsons. END
BEGIN NOW I had a vast deal more to say to you, but I must not stay away from them not any longer. END
BEGIN NOW I assure you they are very genteel people. END
BEGIN NOW He makes a monstrous deal of money, and they keep their own coach. END
BEGIN NOW I have not time to speak to Mrs. Jennings about it myself, but pray tell her I am quite happy to hear she is not in anger against us, and Lady Middleton the same; and if anything should happen to take you and your sister away, and Mrs. Jennings should want company, I am sure we should be very glad to come and stay with her for as long a time as she likes. END
BEGIN NOW I suppose Lady Middleton won't ask us any more this bout. END
BEGIN NOW Good-by; I am sorry Miss Marianne was not here. END
BEGIN NOW Remember me kindly to her. END
BEGIN NOW La! END
BEGIN NOW if you have not got your spotted muslin on!&mdash;I wonder you was not afraid of its being torn. END
BEGIN NOW Such was her parting concern; for after this, she had time only to pay her farewell compliments to Mrs. Jennings, before her company was claimed by Mrs. Richardson; and Elinor was left in possession of knowledge which might feed her powers of reflection some time, though she had learnt very little more than what had been already foreseen and foreplanned in her own mind. END
BEGIN NOW Edward's marriage with Lucy was as firmly determined on, and the time of its taking place remained as absolutely uncertain, as she had concluded it would be;&mdash;every thing depended, exactly after her expectation, on his getting that preferment, of which, at present, there seemed not the smallest chance. END
BEGIN NOW As soon as they returned to the carriage, Mrs. Jennings was eager for information; but as Elinor wished to spread as little as possible intelligence that had in the first place been so unfairly obtained, she confined herself to the brief repetition of such simple particulars, as she felt assured that Lucy, for the sake of her own consequence, would choose to have known. END
BEGIN NOW The continuance of their engagement, and the means that were able to be taken for promoting its end, was all her communication; and this produced from Mrs. Jennings the following natural remark. END
BEGIN NOW Wait for his having a living!&mdash;ay, we all know how THAT will end:&mdash;they will wait a twelvemonth, and finding no good comes of it, will set down upon a curacy of fifty pounds a-year, with the interest of his two thousand pounds, and what little matter Mr. Steele and Mr. Pratt can give her.&mdash;Then they will have a child every year! END
BEGIN NOW and Lord help 'em! END
BEGIN NOW how poor they will be!&mdash;I must see what I can give them towards furnishing their house. END
BEGIN NOW Two maids and two men, indeed!&mdash;as I talked of t'other day.&mdash;No, no, they must get a stout girl of all works.&mdash; Betty's sister would never do for them NOW. END
BEGIN NOW The next morning brought Elinor a letter by the two-penny post from Lucy herself. END
BEGIN NOW It was as follows: Bartlett's Building, March. END
BEGIN NOW I hope my dear Miss Dashwood will excuse the liberty I take of writing to her; but I know your friendship for me will make you pleased to hear such a good account of myself and my dear Edward, after all the troubles we have went through lately, therefore will make no more apologies, but proceed to say that, thank God! END
BEGIN NOW though we have suffered dreadfully, we are both quite well now, and as happy as we must always be in one another's love. END
BEGIN NOW We have had great trials, and great persecutions, but however, at the same time, gratefully acknowledge many friends, yourself not the least among them, whose great kindness I shall always thankfully remember, as will Edward too, who I have told of it. END
BEGIN NOW I am sure you will be glad to hear, as likewise dear Mrs. Jennings, I spent two happy hours with him yesterday afternoon, he would not hear of our parting, though earnestly did I, as I thought my duty required, urge him to it for prudence sake, and would have parted for ever on the spot, would he consent to it; but he said it should never be, he did not regard his mother's anger, while he could have my affections; our prospects are not very bright, to be sure, but we must wait, and hope for the best; he will be ordained shortly; and should it ever be in your power to recommend him to any body that has a living to bestow, am very sure you will not forget us, and dear Mrs. Jennings too, trust she will speak a good word for us to Sir John, or Mr. Palmer, or any friend that may be able to assist us.&mdash;Poor Anne was much to blame for what she did, but she did it for the best, so I say nothing; hope Mrs. Jennings won't think it too much trouble to give us a call, should she come this way any morning, 'twould be a great kindness, and my cousins would be proud to know her.&mdash;My paper reminds me to conclude; and begging to be most gratefully and respectfully remembered to her, and to Sir John, and Lady Middleton, and the dear children, when you chance to see them, and love to Miss Marianne, I am, &c. As soon as Elinor had finished it, she performed what she concluded to be its writer's real design, by placing it in the hands of Mrs. Jennings, who read it aloud with many comments of satisfaction and praise. END
BEGIN NOW Very well indeed!&mdash;how prettily she writes!&mdash;aye, that was quite proper to let him be off if he would. END
BEGIN NOW That was just like Lucy.&mdash;Poor soul! END
BEGIN NOW I wish I COULD get him a living, with all my heart.&mdash;She calls me dear Mrs. Jennings, you see. END
BEGIN NOW She is a good-hearted girl as ever lived.&mdash;Very well upon my word. END
BEGIN NOW That sentence is very prettily turned. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, yes, I will go and see her, sure enough. END
BEGIN NOW How attentive she is, to think of every body!&mdash;Thank you, my dear, for shewing it me. END
BEGIN NOW It is as pretty a letter as ever I saw, and does Lucy's head and heart great credit. END
BEGIN NOW The Miss Dashwoods had now been rather more than two months in town, and Marianne's impatience to be gone increased every day. END
BEGIN NOW She sighed for the air, the liberty, the quiet of the country; and fancied that if any place could give her ease, Barton must do it. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor was hardly less anxious than herself for their removal, and only so much less bent on its being effected immediately, as that she was conscious of the difficulties of so long a journey, which Marianne could not be brought to acknowledge. END
BEGIN NOW She began, however, seriously to turn her thoughts towards its accomplishment, and had already mentioned their wishes to their kind hostess, who resisted them with all the eloquence of her good-will, when a plan was suggested, which, though detaining them from home yet a few weeks longer, appeared to Elinor altogether much more eligible than any other. END
BEGIN NOW The Palmers were to remove to Cleveland about the end of March, for the Easter holidays; and Mrs. Jennings, with both her friends, received a very warm invitation from Charlotte to go with them. END
BEGIN NOW This would not, in itself, have been sufficient for the delicacy of Miss Dashwood;&mdash;but it was inforced with so much real politeness by Mr. Palmer himself, as, joined to the very great amendment of his manners towards them since her sister had been known to be unhappy, induced her to accept it with pleasure. END
BEGIN NOW When she told Marianne what she had done, however, her first reply was not very auspicious. END
BEGIN NOW Cleveland! END
BEGIN NOW &mdash;she cried, with great agitation. END
BEGIN NOW No, I cannot go to Cleveland. END
BEGIN NOW &mdash; You forget, said Elinor gently, that its situation is not...that it is not in the neighbourhood of... END
BEGIN NOW But it is in Somersetshire.&mdash;I cannot go into Somersetshire.&mdash;There, where I looked forward to going...No, Elinor, you cannot expect me to go there. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor would not argue upon the propriety of overcoming such feelings;&mdash;she only endeavoured to counteract them by working on others;&mdash;represented it, therefore, as a measure which would fix the time of her returning to that dear mother, whom she so much wished to see, in a more eligible, more comfortable manner, than any other plan could do, and perhaps without any greater delay. END
BEGIN NOW From Cleveland, which was within a few miles of Bristol, the distance to Barton was not beyond one day, though a long day's journey; and their mother's servant might easily come there to attend them down; and as there could be no occasion of their staying above a week at Cleveland, they might now be at home in little more than three weeks' time. END
BEGIN NOW As Marianne's affection for her mother was sincere, it must triumph with little difficulty, over the imaginary evils she had started. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Jennings was so far from being weary of her guests, that she pressed them very earnestly to return with her again from Cleveland. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor was grateful for the attention, but it could not alter her design; and their mother's concurrence being readily gained, every thing relative to their return was arranged as far as it could be;&mdash;and Marianne found some relief in drawing up a statement of the hours that were yet to divide her from Barton. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW Colonel, I do not know what you and I shall do without the Miss Dashwoods; &mdash;was Mrs. Jennings's address to him when he first called on her, after their leaving her was settled&mdash; for they are quite resolved upon going home from the Palmers;&mdash;and how forlorn we shall be, when I come back!&mdash;Lord! END
BEGIN NOW we shall sit and gape at one another as dull as two cats. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps Mrs. Jennings was in hopes, by this vigorous sketch of their future ennui, to provoke him to make that offer, which might give himself an escape from it;&mdash;and if so, she had soon afterwards good reason to think her object gained; for, on Elinor's moving to the window to take more expeditiously the dimensions of a print, which she was going to copy for her friend, he followed her to it with a look of particular meaning, and conversed with her there for several minutes. END
BEGIN NOW The effect of his discourse on the lady too, could not escape her observation, for though she was too honorable to listen, and had even changed her seat, on purpose that she might NOT hear, to one close by the piano forte on which Marianne was playing, she could not keep herself from seeing that Elinor changed colour, attended with agitation, and was too intent on what he said to pursue her employment.&mdash; Still farther in confirmation of her hopes, in the interval of Marianne's turning from one lesson to another, some words of the Colonel's inevitably reached her ear, in which he seemed to be apologising for the badness of his house. END
BEGIN NOW This set the matter beyond a doubt. END
BEGIN NOW She wondered, indeed, at his thinking it necessary to do so; but supposed it to be the proper etiquette. END
BEGIN NOW What Elinor said in reply she could not distinguish, but judged from the motion of her lips, that she did not think THAT any material objection;&mdash;and Mrs. Jennings commended her in her heart for being so honest. END
BEGIN NOW They then talked on for a few minutes longer without her catching a syllable, when another lucky stop in Marianne's performance brought her these words in the Colonel's calm voice,&mdash; I am afraid it cannot take place very soon. END
BEGIN NOW Astonished and shocked at so unlover-like a speech, she was almost ready to cry out, Lord! END
BEGIN NOW what should hinder it? END
BEGIN NOW &mdash;but checking her desire, confined herself to this silent ejaculation. END
BEGIN NOW This is very strange!&mdash;sure he need not wait to be older. END
BEGIN NOW This delay on the Colonel's side, however, did not seem to offend or mortify his fair companion in the least, for on their breaking up the conference soon afterwards, and moving different ways, Mrs. Jennings very plainly heard Elinor say, and with a voice which shewed her to feel what she said, I shall always think myself very much obliged to you. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Jennings was delighted with her gratitude, and only wondered that after hearing such a sentence, the Colonel should be able to take leave of them, as he immediately did, with the utmost sang-froid, and go away without making her any reply!&mdash;She had not thought her old friend could have made so indifferent a suitor. END
BEGIN NOW What had really passed between them was to this effect. END
BEGIN NOW I have heard, said he, with great compassion, of the injustice your friend Mr. Ferrars has suffered from his family; for if I understand the matter right, he has been entirely cast off by them for persevering in his engagement with a very deserving young woman.&mdash; Have I been rightly informed?&mdash;Is it so?&mdash; Elinor told him that it was. END
BEGIN NOW The cruelty, the impolitic cruelty, &mdash;he replied, with great feeling,&mdash; of dividing, or attempting to divide, two young people long attached to each other, is terrible.&mdash; Mrs. Ferrars does not know what she may be doing&mdash;what she may drive her son to. END
BEGIN NOW I have seen Mr. Ferrars two or three times in Harley Street, and am much pleased with him. END
BEGIN NOW He is not a young man with whom one can be intimately acquainted in a short time, but I have seen enough of him to wish him well for his own sake, and as a friend of yours, I wish it still more. END
BEGIN NOW I understand that he intends to take orders. END
BEGIN NOW Will you be so good as to tell him that the living of Delaford, now just vacant, as I am informed by this day's post, is his, if he think it worth his acceptance&mdash;but THAT, perhaps, so unfortunately circumstanced as he is now, it may be nonsense to appear to doubt; I only wish it were more valuable.&mdash; It is a rectory, but a small one; the late incumbent, I believe, did not make more than L per annum, and though it is certainly capable of improvement, I fear, not to such an amount as to afford him a very comfortable income. END
BEGIN NOW Such as it is, however, my pleasure in presenting it to him, will be very great. END
BEGIN NOW Pray assure him of it. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor's astonishment at this commission could hardly have been greater, had the Colonel been really making her an offer of his hand. END
BEGIN NOW The preferment, which only two days before she had considered as hopeless for Edward, was already provided to enable him to marry;&mdash;and SHE, of all people in the world, was fixed on to bestow it!&mdash;Her emotion was such as Mrs. Jennings had attributed to a very different cause;&mdash;but whatever minor feelings less pure, less pleasing, might have a share in that emotion, her esteem for the general benevolence, and her gratitude for the particular friendship, which together prompted Colonel Brandon to this act, were strongly felt, and warmly expressed. END
BEGIN NOW She thanked him for it with all her heart, spoke of Edward's principles and disposition with that praise which she knew them to deserve; and promised to undertake the commission with pleasure, if it were really his wish to put off so agreeable an office to another. END
BEGIN NOW But at the same time, she could not help thinking that no one could so well perform it as himself. END
BEGIN NOW It was an office in short, from which, unwilling to give Edward the pain of receiving an obligation from HER, she would have been very glad to be spared herself;&mdash; but Colonel Brandon, on motives of equal delicacy, declining it likewise, still seemed so desirous of its being given through her means, that she would not on any account make farther opposition. END
BEGIN NOW Edward, she believed, was still in town, and fortunately she had heard his address from Miss Steele. END
BEGIN NOW She could undertake therefore to inform him of it, in the course of the day. END
BEGIN NOW After this had been settled, Colonel Brandon began to talk of his own advantage in securing so respectable and agreeable a neighbour, and THEN it was that he mentioned with regret, that the house was small and indifferent;&mdash;an evil which Elinor, as Mrs. Jennings had supposed her to do, made very light of, at least as far as regarded its size. END
BEGIN NOW The smallness of the house, said she, I cannot imagine any inconvenience to them, for it will be in proportion to their family and income. END
BEGIN NOW By which the Colonel was surprised to find that SHE was considering Mr. Ferrars's marriage as the certain consequence of the presentation; for he did not suppose it possible that Delaford living could supply such an income, as anybody in his style of life would venture to settle on&mdash;and he said so. END
BEGIN NOW This little rectory CAN do no more than make Mr. Ferrars comfortable as a bachelor; it cannot enable him to marry. END
BEGIN NOW I am sorry to say that my patronage ends with this; and my interest is hardly more extensive. END
BEGIN NOW If, however, by an unforeseen chance it should be in my power to serve him farther, I must think very differently of him from what I now do, if I am not as ready to be useful to him then as I sincerely wish I could be at present. END
BEGIN NOW What I am now doing indeed, seems nothing at all, since it can advance him so little towards what must be his principal, his only object of happiness. END
BEGIN NOW His marriage must still be a distant good;&mdash;at least, I am afraid it cannot take place very soon.&mdash; Such was the sentence which, when misunderstood, so justly offended the delicate feelings of Mrs. Jennings; but after this narration of what really passed between Colonel Brandon and Elinor, while they stood at the window, the gratitude expressed by the latter on their parting, may perhaps appear in general, not less reasonably excited, nor less properly worded than if it had arisen from an offer of marriage. END
BEGIN NOW Well, Miss Dashwood, said Mrs. Jennings, sagaciously smiling, as soon as the gentleman had withdrawn, I do not ask you what the Colonel has been saying to you; for though, upon my honour, I TRIED to keep out of hearing, I could not help catching enough to understand his business. END
BEGIN NOW And I assure you I never was better pleased in my life, and I wish you joy of it with all my heart. END
BEGIN NOW Thank you, ma'am, said Elinor. END
BEGIN NOW It is a matter of great joy to me; and I feel the goodness of Colonel Brandon most sensibly. END
BEGIN NOW There are not many men who would act as he has done. END
BEGIN NOW Few people who have so compassionate a heart! END
BEGIN NOW I never was more astonished in my life. END
BEGIN NOW Lord! END
BEGIN NOW my dear, you are very modest. END
BEGIN NOW I an't the least astonished at it in the world, for I have often thought of late, there was nothing more likely to happen. END
BEGIN NOW You judged from your knowledge of the Colonel's general benevolence; but at least you could not foresee that the opportunity would so very soon occur. END
BEGIN NOW Opportunity! END
BEGIN NOW repeated Mrs. Jennings&mdash; Oh! END
BEGIN NOW as to that, when a man has once made up his mind to such a thing, somehow or other he will soon find an opportunity. END
BEGIN NOW Well, my dear, I wish you joy of it again and again; and if ever there was a happy couple in the world, I think I shall soon know where to look for them. END
BEGIN NOW You mean to go to Delaford after them I suppose, said Elinor, with a faint smile. END
BEGIN NOW Aye, my dear, that I do, indeed. END
BEGIN NOW And as to the house being a bad one, I do not know what the Colonel would be at, for it is as good a one as ever I saw. END
BEGIN NOW He spoke of its being out of repair. END
BEGIN NOW Well, and whose fault is that? END
BEGIN NOW why don't he repair it?&mdash;who should do it but himself? END
BEGIN NOW They were interrupted by the servant's coming in to announce the carriage being at the door; and Mrs. Jennings immediately preparing to go, said,&mdash; Well, my dear, I must be gone before I have had half my talk out. END
BEGIN NOW But, however, we may have it all over in the evening; for we shall be quite alone. END
BEGIN NOW I do not ask you to go with me, for I dare say your mind is too full of the matter to care for company; and besides, you must long to tell your sister all about it. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne had left the room before the conversation began. END
BEGIN NOW Certainly, ma'am, I shall tell Marianne of it; but I shall not mention it at present to any body else. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW very well, said Mrs. Jennings rather disappointed. END
BEGIN NOW Then you would not have me tell it to Lucy, for I think of going as far as Holborn to-day. END
BEGIN NOW No, ma'am, not even Lucy if you please. END
BEGIN NOW One day's delay will not be very material; and till I have written to Mr. Ferrars, I think it ought not to be mentioned to any body else. END
BEGIN NOW I shall do THAT directly. END
BEGIN NOW It is of importance that no time should be lost with him, for he will of course have much to do relative to his ordination. END
BEGIN NOW This speech at first puzzled Mrs. Jennings exceedingly. END
BEGIN NOW Why Mr. Ferrars was to have been written to about it in such a hurry, she could not immediately comprehend. END
BEGIN NOW A few moments' reflection, however, produced a very happy idea, and she exclaimed;&mdash; Oh, ho!&mdash;I understand you. END
BEGIN NOW Mr. Ferrars is to be the man. END
BEGIN NOW Well, so much the better for him. END
BEGIN NOW Ay, to be sure, he must be ordained in readiness; and I am very glad to find things are so forward between you. END
BEGIN NOW But, my dear, is not this rather out of character? END
BEGIN NOW Should not the Colonel write himself?&mdash;sure, he is the proper person. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor did not quite understand the beginning of Mrs. Jennings's speech, neither did she think it worth inquiring into; and therefore only replied to its conclusion. END
BEGIN NOW Colonel Brandon is so delicate a man, that he rather wished any one to announce his intentions to Mr. Ferrars than himself. END
BEGIN NOW And so YOU are forced to do it. END
BEGIN NOW Well THAT is an odd kind of delicacy! END
BEGIN NOW However, I will not disturb you (seeing her preparing to write.) END
BEGIN NOW You know your own concerns best. END
BEGIN NOW So goodby, my dear. END
BEGIN NOW I have not heard of any thing to please me so well since Charlotte was brought to bed. END
BEGIN NOW And away she went; but returning again in a moment, I have just been thinking of Betty's sister, my dear. END
BEGIN NOW I should be very glad to get her so good a mistress. END
BEGIN NOW But whether she would do for a lady's maid, I am sure I can't tell. END
BEGIN NOW She is an excellent housemaid, and works very well at her needle. END
BEGIN NOW However, you will think of all that at your leisure. END
BEGIN NOW Certainly, ma'am, replied Elinor, not hearing much of what she said, and more anxious to be alone, than to be mistress of the subject. END
BEGIN NOW How she should begin&mdash;how she should express herself in her note to Edward, was now all her concern. END
BEGIN NOW The particular circumstances between them made a difficulty of that which to any other person would have been the easiest thing in the world; but she equally feared to say too much or too little, and sat deliberating over her paper, with the pen in her hand, till broken in on by the entrance of Edward himself. END
BEGIN NOW He had met Mrs. Jennings at the door in her way to the carriage, as he came to leave his farewell card; and she, after apologising for not returning herself, had obliged him to enter, by saying that Miss Dashwood was above, and wanted to speak with him on very particular business. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor had just been congratulating herself, in the midst of her perplexity, that however difficult it might be to express herself properly by letter, it was at least preferable to giving the information by word of mouth, when her visitor entered, to force her upon this greatest exertion of all. END
BEGIN NOW Her astonishment and confusion were very great on his so sudden appearance. END
BEGIN NOW She had not seen him before since his engagement became public, and therefore not since his knowing her to be acquainted with it; which, with the consciousness of what she had been thinking of, and what she had to tell him, made her feel particularly uncomfortable for some minutes. END
BEGIN NOW He too was much distressed; and they sat down together in a most promising state of embarrassment.&mdash;Whether he had asked her pardon for his intrusion on first coming into the room, he could not recollect; but determining to be on the safe side, he made his apology in form as soon as he could say any thing, after taking a chair. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Jennings told me, said he, that you wished to speak with me, at least I understood her so&mdash;or I certainly should not have intruded on you in such a manner; though at the same time, I should have been extremely sorry to leave London without seeing you and your sister; especially as it will most likely be some time&mdash;it is not probable that I should soon have the pleasure of meeting you again. END
BEGIN NOW I go to Oxford tomorrow. END
BEGIN NOW You would not have gone, however, said Elinor, recovering herself, and determined to get over what she so much dreaded as soon as possible, without receiving our good wishes, even if we had not been able to give them in person. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Jennings was quite right in what she said. END
BEGIN NOW I have something of consequence to inform you of, which I was on the point of communicating by paper. END
BEGIN NOW I am charged with a most agreeable office (breathing rather faster than usual as she spoke.) END
BEGIN NOW Colonel Brandon, who was here only ten minutes ago, has desired me to say, that understanding you mean to take orders, he has great pleasure in offering you the living of Delaford now just vacant, and only wishes it were more valuable. END
BEGIN NOW Allow me to congratulate you on having so respectable and well-judging a friend, and to join in his wish that the living&mdash;it is about two hundred a-year&mdash;were much more considerable, and such as might better enable you to&mdash;as might be more than a temporary accommodation to yourself&mdash;such, in short, as might establish all your views of happiness. END
BEGIN NOW What Edward felt, as he could not say it himself, it cannot be expected that any one else should say for him. END
BEGIN NOW He LOOKED all the astonishment which such unexpected, such unthought-of information could not fail of exciting; but he said only these two words, Colonel Brandon! END
BEGIN NOW Yes, continued Elinor, gathering more resolution, as some of the worst was over, Colonel Brandon means it as a testimony of his concern for what has lately passed&mdash;for the cruel situation in which the unjustifiable conduct of your family has placed you&mdash;a concern which I am sure Marianne, myself, and all your friends, must share; and likewise as a proof of his high esteem for your general character, and his particular approbation of your behaviour on the present occasion. END
BEGIN NOW Colonel Brandon give ME a living!&mdash;Can it be possible? END
BEGIN NOW The unkindness of your own relations has made you astonished to find friendship any where. END
BEGIN NOW No, replied he, with sudden consciousness, not to find it in YOU; for I cannot be ignorant that to you, to your goodness, I owe it all.&mdash;I feel it&mdash;I would express it if I could&mdash;but, as you well know, I am no orator. END
BEGIN NOW You are very much mistaken. END
BEGIN NOW I do assure you that you owe it entirely, at least almost entirely, to your own merit, and Colonel Brandon's discernment of it. END
BEGIN NOW I have had no hand in it. END
BEGIN NOW I did not even know, till I understood his design, that the living was vacant; nor had it ever occurred to me that he might have had such a living in his gift. END
BEGIN NOW As a friend of mine, of my family, he may, perhaps&mdash;indeed I know he HAS, still greater pleasure in bestowing it; but, upon my word, you owe nothing to my solicitation. END
BEGIN NOW Truth obliged her to acknowledge some small share in the action, but she was at the same time so unwilling to appear as the benefactress of Edward, that she acknowledged it with hesitation; which probably contributed to fix that suspicion in his mind which had recently entered it. END
BEGIN NOW For a short time he sat deep in thought, after Elinor had ceased to speak;&mdash;at last, and as if it were rather an effort, he said, Colonel Brandon seems a man of great worth and respectability. END
BEGIN NOW I have always heard him spoken of as such, and your brother I know esteems him highly. END
BEGIN NOW He is undoubtedly a sensible man, and in his manners perfectly the gentleman. END
BEGIN NOW Indeed, replied Elinor, I believe that you will find him, on farther acquaintance, all that you have heard him to be, and as you will be such very near neighbours (for I understand the parsonage is almost close to the mansion-house,) it is particularly important that he SHOULD be all this. END
BEGIN NOW Edward made no answer; but when she had turned away her head, gave her a look so serious, so earnest, so uncheerful, as seemed to say, that he might hereafter wish the distance between the parsonage and the mansion-house much greater. END
BEGIN NOW Colonel Brandon, I think, lodges in St. James Street, said he, soon afterwards, rising from his chair. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor told him the number of the house. END
BEGIN NOW I must hurry away then, to give him those thanks which you will not allow me to give YOU; to assure him that he has made me a very&mdash;an exceedingly happy man. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor did not offer to detain him; and they parted, with a very earnest assurance on HER side of her unceasing good wishes for his happiness in every change of situation that might befall him; on HIS, with rather an attempt to return the same good will, than the power of expressing it. END
BEGIN NOW When I see him again, said Elinor to herself, as the door shut him out, I shall see him the husband of Lucy. END
BEGIN NOW And with this pleasing anticipation, she sat down to reconsider the past, recall the words and endeavour to comprehend all the feelings of Edward; and, of course, to reflect on her own with discontent. END
BEGIN NOW When Mrs. Jennings came home, though she returned from seeing people whom she had never seen before, and of whom therefore she must have a great deal to say, her mind was so much more occupied by the important secret in her possession, than by anything else, that she reverted to it again as soon as Elinor appeared. END
BEGIN NOW Well, my dear, she cried, I sent you up the young man. END
BEGIN NOW Did not I do right?&mdash;And I suppose you had no great difficulty&mdash;You did not find him very unwilling to accept your proposal? END
BEGIN NOW No, ma'am; THAT was not very likely. END
BEGIN NOW Well, and how soon will he be ready?&mdash;For it seems all to depend upon that. END
BEGIN NOW Really, said Elinor, I know so little of these kind of forms, that I can hardly even conjecture as to the time, or the preparation necessary; but I suppose two or three months will complete his ordination. END
BEGIN NOW Two or three months! END
BEGIN NOW cried Mrs. Jennings; Lord! END
BEGIN NOW my dear, how calmly you talk of it; and can the Colonel wait two or three months! END
BEGIN NOW Lord bless me!&mdash;I am sure it would put ME quite out of patience!&mdash;And though one would be very glad to do a kindness by poor Mr. Ferrars, I do think it is not worth while to wait two or three months for him. END
BEGIN NOW Sure somebody else might be found that would do as well; somebody that is in orders already. END
BEGIN NOW My dear ma'am, said Elinor, what can you be thinking of?&mdash; Why, Colonel Brandon's only object is to be of use to Mr. Ferrars. END
BEGIN NOW Lord bless you, my dear!&mdash;Sure you do not mean to persuade me that the Colonel only marries you for the sake of giving ten guineas to Mr. Ferrars! END
BEGIN NOW The deception could not continue after this; and an explanation immediately took place, by which both gained considerable amusement for the moment, without any material loss of happiness to either, for Mrs. Jennings only exchanged one form of delight for another, and still without forfeiting her expectation of the first. END
BEGIN NOW Aye, aye, the parsonage is but a small one, said she, after the first ebullition of surprise and satisfaction was over, and very likely MAY be out of repair; but to hear a man apologising, as I thought, for a house that to my knowledge has five sitting rooms on the ground-floor, and I think the housekeeper told me could make up fifteen beds!&mdash;and to you too, that had been used to live in Barton cottage!&mdash; It seems quite ridiculous. END
BEGIN NOW But, my dear, we must touch up the Colonel to do some thing to the parsonage, and make it comfortable for them, before Lucy goes to it. END
BEGIN NOW But Colonel Brandon does not seem to have any idea of the living's being enough to allow them to marry. END
BEGIN NOW The Colonel is a ninny, my dear; because he has two thousand a-year himself, he thinks that nobody else can marry on less. END
BEGIN NOW Take my word for it, that, if I am alive, I shall be paying a visit at Delaford Parsonage before Michaelmas; and I am sure I shan't go if Lucy an't there. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor was quite of her opinion, as to the probability of their not waiting for any thing more. END
BEGIN NOW Edward, having carried his thanks to Colonel Brandon, proceeded with his happiness to Lucy; and such was the excess of it by the time he reached Bartlett's Buildings, that she was able to assure Mrs. Jennings, who called on her again the next day with her congratulations, that she had never seen him in such spirits before in her life. END
BEGIN NOW Her own happiness, and her own spirits, were at least very certain; and she joined Mrs. Jennings most heartily in her expectation of their being all comfortably together in Delaford Parsonage before Michaelmas. END
BEGIN NOW So far was she, at the same time, from any backwardness to give Elinor that credit which Edward WOULD give her, that she spoke of her friendship for them both with the most grateful warmth, was ready to own all their obligation to her, and openly declared that no exertion for their good on Miss Dashwood's part, either present or future, would ever surprise her, for she believed her capable of doing any thing in the world for those she really valued. END
BEGIN NOW As for Colonel Brandon, she was not only ready to worship him as a saint, but was moreover truly anxious that he should be treated as one in all worldly concerns; anxious that his tithes should be raised to the utmost; and scarcely resolved to avail herself, at Delaford, as far as she possibly could, of his servants, his carriage, his cows, and his poultry. END
BEGIN NOW It was now above a week since John Dashwood had called in Berkeley Street, and as since that time no notice had been taken by them of his wife's indisposition, beyond one verbal enquiry, Elinor began to feel it necessary to pay her a visit.&mdash;This was an obligation, however, which not only opposed her own inclination, but which had not the assistance of any encouragement from her companions. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne, not contented with absolutely refusing to go herself, was very urgent to prevent her sister's going at all; and Mrs. Jennings, though her carriage was always at Elinor's service, so very much disliked Mrs. John Dashwood, that not even her curiosity to see how she looked after the late discovery, nor her strong desire to affront her by taking Edward's part, could overcome her unwillingness to be in her company again. END
BEGIN NOW The consequence was, that Elinor set out by herself to pay a visit, for which no one could really have less inclination, and to run the risk of a tete-a-tete with a woman, whom neither of the others had so much reason to dislike. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Dashwood was denied; but before the carriage could turn from the house, her husband accidentally came out. END
BEGIN NOW He expressed great pleasure in meeting Elinor, told her that he had been just going to call in Berkeley Street, and, assuring her that Fanny would be very glad to see her, invited her to come in. END
BEGIN NOW They walked up stairs in to the drawing-room.&mdash;Nobody was there. END
BEGIN NOW Fanny is in her own room, I suppose, said he:&mdash; I will go to her presently, for I am sure she will not have the least objection in the world to seeing YOU.&mdash; Very far from it, indeed. END
BEGIN NOW NOW especially there cannot be&mdash;but however, you and Marianne were always great favourites.&mdash;Why would not Marianne come? END
BEGIN NOW &mdash; Elinor made what excuse she could for her. END
BEGIN NOW I am not sorry to see you alone, he replied, for I have a good deal to say to you. END
BEGIN NOW This living of Colonel Brandon's&mdash;can it be true?&mdash;has he really given it to Edward?&mdash;I heard it yesterday by chance, and was coming to you on purpose to enquire farther about it. END
BEGIN NOW It is perfectly true.&mdash;Colonel Brandon has given the living of Delaford to Edward. END
BEGIN NOW Really!&mdash;Well, this is very astonishing!&mdash;no relationship!&mdash;no connection between them!&mdash;and now that livings fetch such a price!&mdash;what was the value of this? END
BEGIN NOW About two hundred a year. END
BEGIN NOW Very well&mdash;and for the next presentation to a living of that value&mdash;supposing the late incumbent to have been old and sickly, and likely to vacate it soon&mdash;he might have got I dare say&mdash;fourteen hundred pounds. END
BEGIN NOW And how came he not to have settled that matter before this person's death?&mdash;NOW indeed it would be too late to sell it, but a man of Colonel Brandon's sense!&mdash;I wonder he should be so improvident in a point of such common, such natural, concern!&mdash;Well, I am convinced that there is a vast deal of inconsistency in almost every human character. END
BEGIN NOW I suppose, however&mdash;on recollection&mdash;that the case may probably be THIS. END
BEGIN NOW Edward is only to hold the living till the person to whom the Colonel has really sold the presentation, is old enough to take it.&mdash;Aye, aye, that is the fact, depend upon it. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor contradicted it, however, very positively; and by relating that she had herself been employed in conveying the offer from Colonel Brandon to Edward, and, therefore, must understand the terms on which it was given, obliged him to submit to her authority. END
BEGIN NOW It is truly astonishing! END
BEGIN NOW &mdash;he cried, after hearing what she said&mdash; what could be the Colonel's motive? END
BEGIN NOW A very simple one&mdash;to be of use to Mr. Ferrars. END
BEGIN NOW Well, well; whatever Colonel Brandon may be, Edward is a very lucky man.&mdash;You will not mention the matter to Fanny, however, for though I have broke it to her, and she bears it vastly well,&mdash;she will not like to hear it much talked of. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor had some difficulty here to refrain from observing, that she thought Fanny might have borne with composure, an acquisition of wealth to her brother, by which neither she nor her child could be possibly impoverished. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Ferrars, added he, lowering his voice to the tone becoming so important a subject, knows nothing about it at present, and I believe it will be best to keep it entirely concealed from her as long as may be.&mdash; When the marriage takes place, I fear she must hear of it all. END
BEGIN NOW But why should such precaution be used?&mdash;Though it is not to be supposed that Mrs. Ferrars can have the smallest satisfaction in knowing that her son has money enough to live upon,&mdash;for THAT must be quite out of the question; yet why, upon her late behaviour, is she supposed to feel at all?&mdash;She has done with her son, she cast him off for ever, and has made all those over whom she had any influence, cast him off likewise. END
BEGIN NOW Surely, after doing so, she cannot be imagined liable to any impression of sorrow or of joy on his account&mdash;she cannot be interested in any thing that befalls him.&mdash; She would not be so weak as to throw away the comfort of a child, and yet retain the anxiety of a parent! END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW Elinor, said John, your reasoning is very good, but it is founded on ignorance of human nature. END
BEGIN NOW When Edward's unhappy match takes place, depend upon it his mother will feel as much as if she had never discarded him; and, therefore every circumstance that may accelerate that dreadful event, must be concealed from her as much as possible. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Ferrars can never forget that Edward is her son. END
BEGIN NOW You surprise me; I should think it must nearly have escaped her memory by THIS time. END
BEGIN NOW You wrong her exceedingly. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Ferrars is one of the most affectionate mothers in the world. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor was silent. END
BEGIN NOW We think NOW, &mdash;said Mr. Dashwood, after a short pause, of ROBERT'S marrying Miss Morton. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor, smiling at the grave and decisive importance of her brother's tone, calmly replied, The lady, I suppose, has no choice in the affair. END
BEGIN NOW Choice!&mdash;how do you mean? END
BEGIN NOW I only mean that I suppose, from your manner of speaking, it must be the same to Miss Morton whether she marry Edward or Robert. END
BEGIN NOW Certainly, there can be no difference; for Robert will now to all intents and purposes be considered as the eldest son;&mdash;and as to any thing else, they are both very agreeable young men: I do not know that one is superior to the other. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor said no more, and John was also for a short time silent.&mdash;His reflections ended thus. END
BEGIN NOW Of ONE thing, my dear sister, kindly taking her hand, and speaking in an awful whisper,&mdash; I may assure you;&mdash;and I WILL do it, because I know it must gratify you. END
BEGIN NOW I have good reason to think&mdash;indeed I have it from the best authority, or I should not repeat it, for otherwise it would be very wrong to say any thing about it&mdash;but I have it from the very best authority&mdash;not that I ever precisely heard Mrs. Ferrars say it herself&mdash;but her daughter DID, and I have it from her&mdash;That in short, whatever objections there might be against a certain&mdash;a certain connection&mdash;you understand me&mdash;it would have been far preferable to her, it would not have given her half the vexation that THIS does. END
BEGIN NOW I was exceedingly pleased to hear that Mrs. Ferrars considered it in that light&mdash;a very gratifying circumstance you know to us all. END
BEGIN NOW 'It would have been beyond comparison,' she said, 'the least evil of the two, and she would be glad to compound NOW for nothing worse.' END
BEGIN NOW But however, all that is quite out of the question&mdash;not to be thought of or mentioned&mdash;as to any attachment you know&mdash;it never could be&mdash;all that is gone by. END
BEGIN NOW But I thought I would just tell you of this, because I knew how much it must please you. END
BEGIN NOW Not that you have any reason to regret, my dear Elinor. END
BEGIN NOW There is no doubt of your doing exceedingly well&mdash;quite as well, or better, perhaps, all things considered. END
BEGIN NOW Has Colonel Brandon been with you lately? END
BEGIN NOW Elinor had heard enough, if not to gratify her vanity, and raise her self-importance, to agitate her nerves and fill her mind;&mdash;and she was therefore glad to be spared from the necessity of saying much in reply herself, and from the danger of hearing any thing more from her brother, by the entrance of Mr. Robert Ferrars. END
BEGIN NOW After a few moments' chat, John Dashwood, recollecting that Fanny was yet uninformed of her sister's being there, quitted the room in quest of her; and Elinor was left to improve her acquaintance with Robert, who, by the gay unconcern, the happy self-complacency of his manner while enjoying so unfair a division of his mother's love and liberality, to the prejudice of his banished brother, earned only by his own dissipated course of life, and that brother's integrity, was confirming her most unfavourable opinion of his head and heart. END
BEGIN NOW They had scarcely been two minutes by themselves, before he began to speak of Edward; for he, too, had heard of the living, and was very inquisitive on the subject. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor repeated the particulars of it, as she had given them to John; and their effect on Robert, though very different, was not less striking than it had been on HIM. END
BEGIN NOW He laughed most immoderately. END
BEGIN NOW The idea of Edward's being a clergyman, and living in a small parsonage-house, diverted him beyond measure;&mdash;and when to that was added the fanciful imagery of Edward reading prayers in a white surplice, and publishing the banns of marriage between John Smith and Mary Brown, he could conceive nothing more ridiculous. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor, while she waited in silence and immovable gravity, the conclusion of such folly, could not restrain her eyes from being fixed on him with a look that spoke all the contempt it excited. END
BEGIN NOW It was a look, however, very well bestowed, for it relieved her own feelings, and gave no intelligence to him. END
BEGIN NOW He was recalled from wit to wisdom, not by any reproof of hers, but by his own sensibility. END
BEGIN NOW We may treat it as a joke, said he, at last, recovering from the affected laugh which had considerably lengthened out the genuine gaiety of the moment&mdash; but, upon my soul, it is a most serious business. END
BEGIN NOW Poor Edward! END
BEGIN NOW he is ruined for ever. END
BEGIN NOW I am extremely sorry for it&mdash;for I know him to be a very good-hearted creature; as well-meaning a fellow perhaps, as any in the world. END
BEGIN NOW You must not judge of him, Miss Dashwood, from YOUR slight acquaintance.&mdash;Poor Edward!&mdash;His manners are certainly not the happiest in nature.&mdash;But we are not all born, you know, with the same powers,&mdash;the same address.&mdash; Poor fellow!&mdash;to see him in a circle of strangers!&mdash;to be sure it was pitiable enough!&mdash;but upon my soul, I believe he has as good a heart as any in the kingdom; and I declare and protest to you I never was so shocked in my life, as when it all burst forth. END
BEGIN NOW I could not believe it.&mdash; My mother was the first person who told me of it; and I, feeling myself called on to act with resolution, immediately said to her, 'My dear madam, I do not know what you may intend to do on the occasion, but as for myself, I must say, that if Edward does marry this young woman, I never will see him again.' END
BEGIN NOW That was what I said immediately.&mdash; I was most uncommonly shocked, indeed!&mdash;Poor Edward!&mdash;he has done for himself completely&mdash;shut himself out for ever from all decent society!&mdash;but, as I directly said to my mother, I am not in the least surprised at it; from his style of education, it was always to be expected. END
BEGIN NOW My poor mother was half frantic. END
BEGIN NOW Have you ever seen the lady? END
BEGIN NOW Yes; once, while she was staying in this house, I happened to drop in for ten minutes; and I saw quite enough of her. END
BEGIN NOW The merest awkward country girl, without style, or elegance, and almost without beauty.&mdash; I remember her perfectly. END
BEGIN NOW Just the kind of girl I should suppose likely to captivate poor Edward. END
BEGIN NOW I offered immediately, as soon as my mother related the affair to me, to talk to him myself, and dissuade him from the match; but it was too late THEN, I found, to do any thing, for unluckily, I was not in the way at first, and knew nothing of it till after the breach had taken place, when it was not for me, you know, to interfere. END
BEGIN NOW But had I been informed of it a few hours earlier&mdash;I think it is most probable&mdash;that something might have been hit on. END
BEGIN NOW I certainly should have represented it to Edward in a very strong light. END
BEGIN NOW 'My dear fellow,' I should have said, 'consider what you are doing. END
BEGIN NOW You are making a most disgraceful connection, and such a one as your family are unanimous in disapproving.' END
BEGIN NOW I cannot help thinking, in short, that means might have been found. END
BEGIN NOW But now it is all too late. END
BEGIN NOW He must be starved, you know;&mdash;that is certain; absolutely starved. END
BEGIN NOW He had just settled this point with great composure, when the entrance of Mrs. John Dashwood put an end to the subject. END
BEGIN NOW But though SHE never spoke of it out of her own family, Elinor could see its influence on her mind, in the something like confusion of countenance with which she entered, and an attempt at cordiality in her behaviour to herself. END
BEGIN NOW She even proceeded so far as to be concerned to find that Elinor and her sister were so soon to leave town, as she had hoped to see more of them;&mdash;an exertion in which her husband, who attended her into the room, and hung enamoured over her accents, seemed to distinguish every thing that was most affectionate and graceful. END
BEGIN NOW One other short call in Harley Street, in which Elinor received her brother's congratulations on their travelling so far towards Barton without any expense, and on Colonel Brandon's being to follow them to Cleveland in a day or two, completed the intercourse of the brother and sisters in town;&mdash;and a faint invitation from Fanny, to come to Norland whenever it should happen to be in their way, which of all things was the most unlikely to occur, with a more warm, though less public, assurance, from John to Elinor, of the promptitude with which he should come to see her at Delaford, was all that foretold any meeting in the country. END
BEGIN NOW It amused her to observe that all her friends seemed determined to send her to Delaford;&mdash;a place, in which, of all others, she would now least chuse to visit, or wish to reside; for not only was it considered as her future home by her brother and Mrs. Jennings, but even Lucy, when they parted, gave her a pressing invitation to visit her there. END
BEGIN NOW Very early in April, and tolerably early in the day, the two parties from Hanover Square and Berkeley Street set out from their respective homes, to meet, by appointment, on the road. END
BEGIN NOW For the convenience of Charlotte and her child, they were to be more than two days on their journey, and Mr. Palmer, travelling more expeditiously with Colonel Brandon, was to join them at Cleveland soon after their arrival. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne, few as had been her hours of comfort in London, and eager as she had long been to quit it, could not, when it came to the point, bid adieu to the house in which she had for the last time enjoyed those hopes, and that confidence, in Willoughby, which were now extinguished for ever, without great pain. END
BEGIN NOW Nor could she leave the place in which Willoughby remained, busy in new engagements, and new schemes, in which SHE could have no share, without shedding many tears. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor's satisfaction, at the moment of removal, was more positive. END
BEGIN NOW She had no such object for her lingering thoughts to fix on, she left no creature behind, from whom it would give her a moment's regret to be divided for ever, she was pleased to be free herself from the persecution of Lucy's friendship, she was grateful for bringing her sister away unseen by Willoughby since his marriage, and she looked forward with hope to what a few months of tranquility at Barton might do towards restoring Marianne's peace of mind, and confirming her own. END
BEGIN NOW Their journey was safely performed. END
BEGIN NOW The second day brought them into the cherished, or the prohibited, county of Somerset, for as such was it dwelt on by turns in Marianne's imagination; and in the forenoon of the third they drove up to Cleveland. END
BEGIN NOW Cleveland was a spacious, modern-built house, situated on a sloping lawn. END
BEGIN NOW It had no park, but the pleasure-grounds were tolerably extensive; and like every other place of the same degree of importance, it had its open shrubbery, and closer wood walk, a road of smooth gravel winding round a plantation, led to the front, the lawn was dotted over with timber, the house itself was under the guardianship of the fir, the mountain-ash, and the acacia, and a thick screen of them altogether, interspersed with tall Lombardy poplars, shut out the offices. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne entered the house with a heart swelling with emotion from the consciousness of being only eighty miles from Barton, and not thirty from Combe Magna; and before she had been five minutes within its walls, while the others were busily helping Charlotte to show her child to the housekeeper, she quitted it again, stealing away through the winding shrubberies, now just beginning to be in beauty, to gain a distant eminence; where, from its Grecian temple, her eye, wandering over a wide tract of country to the south-east, could fondly rest on the farthest ridge of hills in the horizon, and fancy that from their summits Combe Magna might be seen. END
BEGIN NOW In such moments of precious, invaluable misery, she rejoiced in tears of agony to be at Cleveland; and as she returned by a different circuit to the house, feeling all the happy privilege of country liberty, of wandering from place to place in free and luxurious solitude, she resolved to spend almost every hour of every day while she remained with the Palmers, in the indulgence of such solitary rambles. END
BEGIN NOW She returned just in time to join the others as they quitted the house, on an excursion through its more immediate premises; and the rest of the morning was easily whiled away, in lounging round the kitchen garden, examining the bloom upon its walls, and listening to the gardener's lamentations upon blights, in dawdling through the green-house, where the loss of her favourite plants, unwarily exposed, and nipped by the lingering frost, raised the laughter of Charlotte,&mdash;and in visiting her poultry-yard, where, in the disappointed hopes of her dairy-maid, by hens forsaking their nests, or being stolen by a fox, or in the rapid decrease of a promising young brood, she found fresh sources of merriment. END
BEGIN NOW The morning was fine and dry, and Marianne, in her plan of employment abroad, had not calculated for any change of weather during their stay at Cleveland. END
BEGIN NOW With great surprise therefore, did she find herself prevented by a settled rain from going out again after dinner. END
BEGIN NOW She had depended on a twilight walk to the Grecian temple, and perhaps all over the grounds, and an evening merely cold or damp would not have deterred her from it; but a heavy and settled rain even SHE could not fancy dry or pleasant weather for walking. END
BEGIN NOW Their party was small, and the hours passed quietly away. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Palmer had her child, and Mrs. Jennings her carpet-work; they talked of the friends they had left behind, arranged Lady Middleton's engagements, and wondered whether Mr. Palmer and Colonel Brandon would get farther than Reading that night. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor, however little concerned in it, joined in their discourse; and Marianne, who had the knack of finding her way in every house to the library, however it might be avoided by the family in general, soon procured herself a book. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing was wanting on Mrs. Palmer's side that constant and friendly good humour could do, to make them feel themselves welcome. END
BEGIN NOW The openness and heartiness of her manner more than atoned for that want of recollection and elegance which made her often deficient in the forms of politeness; her kindness, recommended by so pretty a face, was engaging; her folly, though evident was not disgusting, because it was not conceited; and Elinor could have forgiven every thing but her laugh. END
BEGIN NOW The two gentlemen arrived the next day to a very late dinner, affording a pleasant enlargement of the party, and a very welcome variety to their conversation, which a long morning of the same continued rain had reduced very low. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor had seen so little of Mr. Palmer, and in that little had seen so much variety in his address to her sister and herself, that she knew not what to expect to find him in his own family. END
BEGIN NOW She found him, however, perfectly the gentleman in his behaviour to all his visitors, and only occasionally rude to his wife and her mother; she found him very capable of being a pleasant companion, and only prevented from being so always, by too great an aptitude to fancy himself as much superior to people in general, as he must feel himself to be to Mrs. Jennings and Charlotte. END
BEGIN NOW For the rest of his character and habits, they were marked, as far as Elinor could perceive, with no traits at all unusual in his sex and time of life. END
BEGIN NOW He was nice in his eating, uncertain in his hours; fond of his child, though affecting to slight it; and idled away the mornings at billiards, which ought to have been devoted to business. END
BEGIN NOW She liked him, however, upon the whole, much better than she had expected, and in her heart was not sorry that she could like him no more;&mdash;not sorry to be driven by the observation of his Epicurism, his selfishness, and his conceit, to rest with complacency on the remembrance of Edward's generous temper, simple taste, and diffident feelings. END
BEGIN NOW Of Edward, or at least of some of his concerns, she now received intelligence from Colonel Brandon, who had been into Dorsetshire lately; and who, treating her at once as the disinterested friend of Mr. Ferrars, and the kind confidante of himself, talked to her a great deal of the parsonage at Delaford, described its deficiencies, and told her what he meant to do himself towards removing them.&mdash;His behaviour to her in this, as well as in every other particular, his open pleasure in meeting her after an absence of only ten days, his readiness to converse with her, and his deference for her opinion, might very well justify Mrs. Jennings's persuasion of his attachment, and would have been enough, perhaps, had not Elinor still, as from the first, believed Marianne his real favourite, to make her suspect it herself. END
BEGIN NOW But as it was, such a notion had scarcely ever entered her head, except by Mrs. Jennings's suggestion; and she could not help believing herself the nicest observer of the two;&mdash;she watched his eyes, while Mrs. Jennings thought only of his behaviour;&mdash;and while his looks of anxious solicitude on Marianne's feeling, in her head and throat, the beginning of a heavy cold, because unexpressed by words, entirely escaped the latter lady's observation;&mdash;SHE could discover in them the quick feelings, and needless alarm of a lover. END
BEGIN NOW Two delightful twilight walks on the third and fourth evenings of her being there, not merely on the dry gravel of the shrubbery, but all over the grounds, and especially in the most distant parts of them, where there was something more of wildness than in the rest, where the trees were the oldest, and the grass was the longest and wettest, had&mdash;assisted by the still greater imprudence of sitting in her wet shoes and stockings&mdash;given Marianne a cold so violent as, though for a day or two trifled with or denied, would force itself by increasing ailments on the concern of every body, and the notice of herself. END
BEGIN NOW Prescriptions poured in from all quarters, and as usual, were all declined. END
BEGIN NOW Though heavy and feverish, with a pain in her limbs, and a cough, and a sore throat, a good night's rest was to cure her entirely; and it was with difficulty that Elinor prevailed on her, when she went to bed, to try one or two of the simplest of the remedies. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne got up the next morning at her usual time; to every inquiry replied that she was better, and tried to prove herself so, by engaging in her accustomary employments. END
BEGIN NOW But a day spent in sitting shivering over the fire with a book in her hand, which she was unable to read, or in lying, weary and languid, on a sofa, did not speak much in favour of her amendment; and when, at last, she went early to bed, more and more indisposed, Colonel Brandon was only astonished at her sister's composure, who, though attending and nursing her the whole day, against Marianne's inclination, and forcing proper medicines on her at night, trusted, like Marianne, to the certainty and efficacy of sleep, and felt no real alarm. END
BEGIN NOW A very restless and feverish night, however, disappointed the expectation of both; and when Marianne, after persisting in rising, confessed herself unable to sit up, and returned voluntarily to her bed, Elinor was very ready to adopt Mrs. Jennings's advice, of sending for the Palmers' apothecary. END
BEGIN NOW He came, examined his patient, and though encouraging Miss Dashwood to expect that a very few days would restore her sister to health, yet, by pronouncing her disorder to have a putrid tendency, and allowing the word infection to pass his lips, gave instant alarm to Mrs. Palmer, on her baby's account. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Jennings, who had been inclined from the first to think Marianne's complaint more serious than Elinor, now looked very grave on Mr. Harris's report, and confirming Charlotte's fears and caution, urged the necessity of her immediate removal with her infant; and Mr. Palmer, though treating their apprehensions as idle, found the anxiety and importunity of his wife too great to be withstood. END
BEGIN NOW Her departure, therefore, was fixed on; and within an hour after Mr. Harris's arrival, she set off, with her little boy and his nurse, for the house of a near relation of Mr. Palmer's, who lived a few miles on the other side of Bath; whither her husband promised, at her earnest entreaty, to join her in a day or two; and whither she was almost equally urgent with her mother to accompany her. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Jennings, however, with a kindness of heart which made Elinor really love her, declared her resolution of not stirring from Cleveland as long as Marianne remained ill, and of endeavouring, by her own attentive care, to supply to her the place of the mother she had taken her from; and Elinor found her on every occasion a most willing and active helpmate, desirous to share in all her fatigues, and often by her better experience in nursing, of material use. END
BEGIN NOW Poor Marianne, languid and low from the nature of her malady, and feeling herself universally ill, could no longer hope that tomorrow would find her recovered; and the idea of what tomorrow would have produced, but for this unlucky illness, made every ailment severe; for on that day they were to have begun their journey home; and, attended the whole way by a servant of Mrs. Jennings, were to have taken their mother by surprise on the following forenoon. END
BEGIN NOW The little she said was all in lamentation of this inevitable delay; though Elinor tried to raise her spirits, and make her believe, as she THEN really believed herself, that it would be a very short one. END
BEGIN NOW The next day produced little or no alteration in the state of the patient; she certainly was not better, and, except that there was no amendment, did not appear worse. END
BEGIN NOW Their party was now farther reduced; for Mr. Palmer, though very unwilling to go as well from real humanity and good-nature, as from a dislike of appearing to be frightened away by his wife, was persuaded at last by Colonel Brandon to perform his promise of following her; and while he was preparing to go, Colonel Brandon himself, with a much greater exertion, began to talk of going likewise.&mdash;Here, however, the kindness of Mrs. Jennings interposed most acceptably; for to send the Colonel away while his love was in so much uneasiness on her sister's account, would be to deprive them both, she thought, of every comfort; and therefore telling him at once that his stay at Cleveland was necessary to herself, that she should want him to play at piquet of an evening, while Miss Dashwood was above with her sister, &c. she urged him so strongly to remain, that he, who was gratifying the first wish of his own heart by a compliance, could not long even affect to demur; especially as Mrs. Jennings's entreaty was warmly seconded by Mr. Palmer, who seemed to feel a relief to himself, in leaving behind him a person so well able to assist or advise Miss Dashwood in any emergence. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne was, of course, kept in ignorance of all these arrangements. END
BEGIN NOW She knew not that she had been the means of sending the owners of Cleveland away, in about seven days from the time of their arrival. END
BEGIN NOW It gave her no surprise that she saw nothing of Mrs. Palmer; and as it gave her likewise no concern, she never mentioned her name. END
BEGIN NOW Two days passed away from the time of Mr. Palmer's departure, and her situation continued, with little variation, the same. END
BEGIN NOW Mr. Harris, who attended her every day, still talked boldly of a speedy recovery, and Miss Dashwood was equally sanguine; but the expectation of the others was by no means so cheerful. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Jennings had determined very early in the seizure that Marianne would never get over it, and Colonel Brandon, who was chiefly of use in listening to Mrs. Jennings's forebodings, was not in a state of mind to resist their influence. END
BEGIN NOW He tried to reason himself out of fears, which the different judgment of the apothecary seemed to render absurd; but the many hours of each day in which he was left entirely alone, were but too favourable for the admission of every melancholy idea, and he could not expel from his mind the persuasion that he should see Marianne no more. END
BEGIN NOW On the morning of the third day however, the gloomy anticipations of both were almost done away; for when Mr. Harris arrived, he declared his patient materially better. END
BEGIN NOW Her pulse was much stronger, and every symptom more favourable than on the preceding visit. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor, confirmed in every pleasant hope, was all cheerfulness; rejoicing that in her letters to her mother, she had pursued her own judgment rather than her friend's, in making very light of the indisposition which delayed them at Cleveland; and almost fixing on the time when Marianne would be able to travel. END
BEGIN NOW But the day did not close so auspiciously as it began.&mdash; Towards the evening Marianne became ill again, growing more heavy, restless, and uncomfortable than before. END
BEGIN NOW Her sister, however, still sanguine, was willing to attribute the change to nothing more than the fatigue of having sat up to have her bed made; and carefully administering the cordials prescribed, saw her, with satisfaction, sink at last into a slumber, from which she expected the most beneficial effects. END
BEGIN NOW Her sleep, though not so quiet as Elinor wished to see it, lasted a considerable time; and anxious to observe the result of it herself, she resolved to sit with her during the whole of it. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Jennings, knowing nothing of any change in the patient, went unusually early to bed; her maid, who was one of the principal nurses, was recreating herself in the housekeeper's room, and Elinor remained alone with Marianne. END
BEGIN NOW The repose of the latter became more and more disturbed; and her sister, who watched, with unremitting attention her continual change of posture, and heard the frequent but inarticulate sounds of complaint which passed her lips, was almost wishing to rouse her from so painful a slumber, when Marianne, suddenly awakened by some accidental noise in the house, started hastily up, and, with feverish wildness, cried out,&mdash; Is mama coming?&mdash; Not yet, cried the other, concealing her terror, and assisting Marianne to lie down again, but she will be here, I hope, before it is long. END
BEGIN NOW It is a great way, you know, from hence to Barton. END
BEGIN NOW But she must not go round by London, cried Marianne, in the same hurried manner. END
BEGIN NOW I shall never see her, if she goes by London. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor perceived with alarm that she was not quite herself, and, while attempting to soothe her, eagerly felt her pulse. END
BEGIN NOW It was lower and quicker than ever! END
BEGIN NOW and Marianne, still talking wildly of mama, her alarm increased so rapidly, as to determine her on sending instantly for Mr. Harris, and despatching a messenger to Barton for her mother. END
BEGIN NOW To consult with Colonel Brandon on the best means of effecting the latter, was a thought which immediately followed the resolution of its performance; and as soon she had rung up the maid to take her place by her sister, she hastened down to the drawing-room, where she knew he was generally to be found at a much later hour than the present. END
BEGIN NOW It was no time for hesitation. END
BEGIN NOW Her fears and her difficulties were immediately before him. END
BEGIN NOW Her fears, he had no courage, no confidence to attempt the removal of:&mdash;he listened to them in silent despondence;&mdash;but her difficulties were instantly obviated, for with a readiness that seemed to speak the occasion, and the service pre-arranged in his mind, he offered himself as the messenger who should fetch Mrs. Dashwood. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor made no resistance that was not easily overcome. END
BEGIN NOW She thanked him with brief, though fervent gratitude, and while he went to hurry off his servant with a message to Mr. Harris, and an order for post-horses directly, she wrote a few lines to her mother. END
BEGIN NOW The comfort of such a friend at that moment as Colonel Brandon&mdash;or such a companion for her mother,&mdash;how gratefully was it felt!&mdash;a companion whose judgment would guide, whose attendance must relieve, and whose friendship might soothe her!&mdash;as far as the shock of such a summons COULD be lessened to her, his presence, his manners, his assistance, would lessen it. END
BEGIN NOW HE, meanwhile, whatever he might feel, acted with all the firmness of a collected mind, made every necessary arrangement with the utmost despatch, and calculated with exactness the time in which she might look for his return. END
BEGIN NOW Not a moment was lost in delay of any kind. END
BEGIN NOW The horses arrived, even before they were expected, and Colonel Brandon only pressing her hand with a look of solemnity, and a few words spoken too low to reach her ear, hurried into the carriage. END
BEGIN NOW It was then about twelve o'clock, and she returned to her sister's apartment to wait for the arrival of the apothecary, and to watch by her the rest of the night. END
BEGIN NOW It was a night of almost equal suffering to both. END
BEGIN NOW Hour after hour passed away in sleepless pain and delirium on Marianne's side, and in the most cruel anxiety on Elinor's, before Mr. Harris appeared. END
BEGIN NOW Her apprehensions once raised, paid by their excess for all her former security; and the servant who sat up with her, for she would not allow Mrs. Jennings to be called, only tortured her more, by hints of what her mistress had always thought. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne's ideas were still, at intervals, fixed incoherently on her mother, and whenever she mentioned her name, it gave a pang to the heart of poor Elinor, who, reproaching herself for having trifled with so many days of illness, and wretched for some immediate relief, fancied that all relief might soon be in vain, that every thing had been delayed too long, and pictured to herself her suffering mother arriving too late to see this darling child, or to see her rational. END
BEGIN NOW She was on the point of sending again for Mr. Harris, or if HE could not come, for some other advice, when the former&mdash;but not till after five o'clock&mdash;arrived. END
BEGIN NOW His opinion, however, made some little amends for his delay, for though acknowledging a very unexpected and unpleasant alteration in his patient, he would not allow the danger to be material, and talked of the relief which a fresh mode of treatment must procure, with a confidence which, in a lesser degree, was communicated to Elinor. END
BEGIN NOW He promised to call again in the course of three or four hours, and left both the patient and her anxious attendant more composed than he had found them. END
BEGIN NOW With strong concern, and with many reproaches for not being called to their aid, did Mrs. Jennings hear in the morning of what had passed. END
BEGIN NOW Her former apprehensions, now with greater reason restored, left her no doubt of the event; and though trying to speak comfort to Elinor, her conviction of her sister's danger would not allow her to offer the comfort of hope. END
BEGIN NOW Her heart was really grieved. END
BEGIN NOW The rapid decay, the early death of a girl so young, so lovely as Marianne, must have struck a less interested person with concern. END
BEGIN NOW On Mrs. Jennings's compassion she had other claims. END
BEGIN NOW She had been for three months her companion, was still under her care, and she was known to have been greatly injured, and long unhappy. END
BEGIN NOW The distress of her sister too, particularly a favourite, was before her;&mdash;and as for their mother, when Mrs. Jennings considered that Marianne might probably be to HER what Charlotte was to herself, her sympathy in HER sufferings was very sincere. END
BEGIN NOW Mr. Harris was punctual in his second visit;&mdash;but he came to be disappointed in his hopes of what the last would produce. END
BEGIN NOW His medicines had failed;&mdash;the fever was unabated; and Marianne only more quiet&mdash;not more herself&mdash;remained in a heavy stupor. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor, catching all, and more than all, his fears in a moment, proposed to call in further advice. END
BEGIN NOW But he judged it unnecessary: he had still something more to try, some more fresh application, of whose success he was as confident as the last, and his visit concluded with encouraging assurances which reached the ear, but could not enter the heart of Miss Dashwood. END
BEGIN NOW She was calm, except when she thought of her mother; but she was almost hopeless; and in this state she continued till noon, scarcely stirring from her sister's bed, her thoughts wandering from one image of grief, one suffering friend to another, and her spirits oppressed to the utmost by the conversation of Mrs. Jennings, who scrupled not to attribute the severity and danger of this attack to the many weeks of previous indisposition which Marianne's disappointment had brought on. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor felt all the reasonableness of the idea, and it gave fresh misery to her reflections. END
BEGIN NOW About noon, however, she began&mdash;but with a caution&mdash;a dread of disappointment which for some time kept her silent, even to her friend&mdash;to fancy, to hope she could perceive a slight amendment in her sister's pulse;&mdash;she waited, watched, and examined it again and again;&mdash;and at last, with an agitation more difficult to bury under exterior calmness, than all her foregoing distress, ventured to communicate her hopes. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Jennings, though forced, on examination, to acknowledge a temporary revival, tried to keep her young friend from indulging a thought of its continuance;&mdash;and Elinor, conning over every injunction of distrust, told herself likewise not to hope. END
BEGIN NOW But it was too late. END
BEGIN NOW Hope had already entered; and feeling all its anxious flutter, she bent over her sister to watch&mdash;she hardly knew for what. END
BEGIN NOW Half an hour passed away, and the favourable symptom yet blessed her. END
BEGIN NOW Others even arose to confirm it. END
BEGIN NOW Her breath, her skin, her lips, all flattered Elinor with signs of amendment; and Marianne fixed her eyes on her with a rational, though languid, gaze. END
BEGIN NOW Anxiety and hope now oppressed her in equal degrees, and left her no moment of tranquillity till the arrival of Mr. Harris at four o'clock;&mdash;when his assurances, his felicitations on a recovery in her sister even surpassing his expectation, gave her confidence, comfort, and tears of joy. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne was in every respect materially better, and he declared her entirely out of danger. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Jennings, perhaps satisfied with the partial justification of her forebodings which had been found in their late alarm, allowed herself to trust in his judgment, and admitted, with unfeigned joy, and soon with unequivocal cheerfulness, the probability of an entire recovery. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor could not be cheerful. END
BEGIN NOW Her joy was of a different kind, and led to any thing rather than to gaiety. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne restored to life, health, friends, and to her doting mother, was an idea to fill her heart with sensations of exquisite comfort, and expand it in fervent gratitude;&mdash;but it led to no outward demonstrations of joy, no words, no smiles. END
BEGIN NOW All within Elinor's breast was satisfaction, silent and strong. END
BEGIN NOW She continued by the side of her sister, with little intermission the whole afternoon, calming every fear, satisfying every inquiry of her enfeebled spirits, supplying every succour, and watching almost every look and every breath. END
BEGIN NOW The possibility of a relapse would of course, in some moments, occur to remind her of what anxiety was&mdash;but when she saw, on her frequent and minute examination, that every symptom of recovery continued, and saw Marianne at six o'clock sink into a quiet, steady, and to all appearance comfortable, sleep, she silenced every doubt. END
BEGIN NOW The time was now drawing on, when Colonel Brandon might be expected back. END
BEGIN NOW At ten o'clock, she trusted, or at least not much later her mother would be relieved from the dreadful suspense in which she must now be travelling towards them. END
BEGIN NOW The Colonel, too!&mdash;perhaps scarcely less an object of pity!&mdash;Oh!&mdash;how slow was the progress of time which yet kept them in ignorance! END
BEGIN NOW At seven o'clock, leaving Marianne still sweetly asleep, she joined Mrs. Jennings in the drawing-room to tea. END
BEGIN NOW Of breakfast she had been kept by her fears, and of dinner by their sudden reverse, from eating much;&mdash;and the present refreshment, therefore, with such feelings of content as she brought to it, was particularly welcome. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Jennings would have persuaded her, at its conclusion, to take some rest before her mother's arrival, and allow HER to take her place by Marianne; but Elinor had no sense of fatigue, no capability of sleep at that moment about her, and she was not to be kept away from her sister an unnecessary instant. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Jennings therefore attending her up stairs into the sick chamber, to satisfy herself that all continued right, left her there again to her charge and her thoughts, and retired to her own room to write letters and sleep. END
BEGIN NOW The night was cold and stormy. END
BEGIN NOW The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows; but Elinor, all happiness within, regarded it not. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne slept through every blast; and the travellers&mdash;they had a rich reward in store, for every present inconvenience. END
BEGIN NOW The clock struck eight. END
BEGIN NOW Had it been ten, Elinor would have been convinced that at that moment she heard a carriage driving up to the house; and so strong was the persuasion that she DID, in spite of the ALMOST impossibility of their being already come, that she moved into the adjoining dressing-closet and opened a window shutter, to be satisfied of the truth. END
BEGIN NOW She instantly saw that her ears had not deceived her. END
BEGIN NOW The flaring lamps of a carriage were immediately in view. END
BEGIN NOW By their uncertain light she thought she could discern it to be drawn by four horses; and this, while it told the excess of her poor mother's alarm, gave some explanation to such unexpected rapidity. END
BEGIN NOW Never in her life had Elinor found it so difficult to be calm, as at that moment. END
BEGIN NOW The knowledge of what her mother must be feeling as the carriage stopt at the door&mdash;of her doubt&mdash;her dread&mdash;perhaps her despair!&mdash;and of what SHE had to tell!&mdash;with such knowledge it was impossible to be calm. END
BEGIN NOW All that remained to be done was to be speedy; and, therefore staying only till she could leave Mrs. Jennings's maid with her sister, she hurried down stairs. END
BEGIN NOW The bustle in the vestibule, as she passed along an inner lobby, assured her that they were already in the house. END
BEGIN NOW She rushed to the drawing-room,&mdash;she entered it,&mdash;and saw only Willoughby. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor, starting back with a look of horror at the sight of him, obeyed the first impulse of her heart in turning instantly to quit the room, and her hand was already on the lock, when its action was suspended by his hastily advancing, and saying, in a voice rather of command than supplication, Miss Dashwood, for half an hour&mdash;for ten minutes&mdash;I entreat you to stay. END
BEGIN NOW No, sir, she replied with firmness, I shall NOT stay. END
BEGIN NOW Your business cannot be with ME. END
BEGIN NOW The servants, I suppose, forgot to tell you that Mr. Palmer was not in the house. END
BEGIN NOW Had they told me, he cried with vehemence, that Mr. Palmer and all his relations were at the devil, it would not have turned me from the door. END
BEGIN NOW My business is with you, and only you. END
BEGIN NOW With me! END
BEGIN NOW &mdash;in the utmost amazement&mdash; well, sir,&mdash;be quick&mdash;and if you can&mdash;less violent. END
BEGIN NOW Sit down, and I will be both. END
BEGIN NOW She hesitated; she knew not what to do. END
BEGIN NOW The possibility of Colonel Brandon's arriving and finding her there, came across her. END
BEGIN NOW But she had promised to hear him, and her curiosity no less than her honor was engaged. END
BEGIN NOW After a moment's recollection, therefore, concluding that prudence required dispatch, and that her acquiescence would best promote it, she walked silently towards the table, and sat down. END
BEGIN NOW He took the opposite chair, and for half a minute not a word was said by either. END
BEGIN NOW Pray be quick, sir, &mdash;said Elinor, impatiently;&mdash; I have no time to spare. END
BEGIN NOW He was sitting in an attitude of deep meditation, and seemed not to hear her. END
BEGIN NOW Your sister, said he, with abruptness, a moment afterwards&mdash; is out of danger. END
BEGIN NOW I heard it from the servant. END
BEGIN NOW God be praised!&mdash;But is it true? END
BEGIN NOW is it really true? END
BEGIN NOW Elinor would not speak. END
BEGIN NOW He repeated the inquiry with yet greater eagerness. END
BEGIN NOW For God's sake tell me, is she out of danger, or is she not? END
BEGIN NOW We hope she is. END
BEGIN NOW He rose up, and walked across the room. END
BEGIN NOW Had I known as much half an hour ago&mdash;But since I AM here, &mdash;speaking with a forced vivacity as he returned to his seat&mdash; what does it signify?&mdash;For once, Miss Dashwood&mdash;it will be the last time, perhaps&mdash;let us be cheerful together.&mdash;I am in a fine mood for gaiety.&mdash; Tell me honestly &mdash;a deeper glow overspreading his cheeks&mdash; do you think me most a knave or a fool? END
BEGIN NOW Elinor looked at him with greater astonishment than ever. END
BEGIN NOW She began to think that he must be in liquor;&mdash;the strangeness of such a visit, and of such manners, seemed no otherwise intelligible; and with this impression she immediately rose, saying, Mr. Willoughby, I advise you at present to return to Combe&mdash;I am not at leisure to remain with you longer.&mdash; Whatever your business may be with me, it will be better recollected and explained to-morrow. END
BEGIN NOW I understand you, he replied, with an expressive smile, and a voice perfectly calm; yes, I am very drunk.&mdash; A pint of porter with my cold beef at Marlborough was enough to over-set me. END
BEGIN NOW At Marlborough! END
BEGIN NOW &mdash;cried Elinor, more and more at a loss to understand what he would be at. END
BEGIN NOW Yes,&mdash;I left London this morning at eight o'clock, and the only ten minutes I have spent out of my chaise since that time procured me a nuncheon at Marlborough. END
BEGIN NOW The steadiness of his manner, and the intelligence of his eye as he spoke, convincing Elinor, that whatever other unpardonable folly might bring him to Cleveland, he was not brought there by intoxication, she said, after a moment's recollection, Mr. Willoughby, you OUGHT to feel, and I certainly DO&mdash;that after what has passed&mdash;your coming here in this manner, and forcing yourself upon my notice, requires a very particular excuse.&mdash;What is it, that you mean by it? END
BEGIN NOW &mdash; I mean, &mdash;said he, with serious energy&mdash; if I can, to make you hate me one degree less than you do NOW. END
BEGIN NOW I mean to offer some kind of explanation, some kind of apology, for the past; to open my whole heart to you, and by convincing you, that though I have been always a blockhead, I have not been always a rascal, to obtain something like forgiveness from Ma&mdash;from your sister. END
BEGIN NOW Is this the real reason of your coming? END
BEGIN NOW Upon my soul it is, &mdash;was his answer, with a warmth which brought all the former Willoughby to her remembrance, and in spite of herself made her think him sincere. END
BEGIN NOW If that is all, you may be satisfied already,&mdash;for Marianne DOES&mdash;she has LONG forgiven you. END
BEGIN NOW Has she? END
BEGIN NOW &mdash;he cried, in the same eager tone.&mdash; Then she has forgiven me before she ought to have done it. END
BEGIN NOW But she shall forgive me again, and on more reasonable grounds.&mdash;NOW will you listen to me? END
BEGIN NOW Elinor bowed her assent. END
BEGIN NOW I do not know, said he, after a pause of expectation on her side, and thoughtfulness on his own,&mdash; how YOU may have accounted for my behaviour to your sister, or what diabolical motive you may have imputed to me.&mdash; Perhaps you will hardly think the better of me,&mdash;it is worth the trial however, and you shall hear every thing. END
BEGIN NOW When I first became intimate in your family, I had no other intention, no other view in the acquaintance than to pass my time pleasantly while I was obliged to remain in Devonshire, more pleasantly than I had ever done before. END
BEGIN NOW Your sister's lovely person and interesting manners could not but please me; and her behaviour to me almost from the first, was of a kind&mdash;It is astonishing, when I reflect on what it was, and what SHE was, that my heart should have been so insensible! END
BEGIN NOW But at first I must confess, my vanity only was elevated by it. END
BEGIN NOW Careless of her happiness, thinking only of my own amusement, giving way to feelings which I had always been too much in the habit of indulging, I endeavoured, by every means in my power, to make myself pleasing to her, without any design of returning her affection. END
BEGIN NOW Miss Dashwood, at this point, turning her eyes on him with the most angry contempt, stopped him, by saying, It is hardly worth while, Mr. Willoughby, for you to relate, or for me to listen any longer. END
BEGIN NOW Such a beginning as this cannot be followed by any thing.&mdash; Do not let me be pained by hearing any thing more on the subject. END
BEGIN NOW I insist on you hearing the whole of it, he replied, My fortune was never large, and I had always been expensive, always in the habit of associating with people of better income than myself. END
BEGIN NOW Every year since my coming of age, or even before, I believe, had added to my debts; and though the death of my old cousin, Mrs. Smith, was to set me free; yet that event being uncertain, and possibly far distant, it had been for some time my intention to re-establish my circumstances by marrying a woman of fortune. END
BEGIN NOW To attach myself to your sister, therefore, was not a thing to be thought of;&mdash;and with a meanness, selfishness, cruelty&mdash;which no indignant, no contemptuous look, even of yours, Miss Dashwood, can ever reprobate too much&mdash;I was acting in this manner, trying to engage her regard, without a thought of returning it.&mdash;But one thing may be said for me: even in that horrid state of selfish vanity, I did not know the extent of the injury I meditated, because I did not THEN know what it was to love. END
BEGIN NOW But have I ever known it?&mdash;Well may it be doubted; for, had I really loved, could I have sacrificed my feelings to vanity, to avarice?&mdash;or, what is more, could I have sacrificed hers?&mdash; But I have done it. END
BEGIN NOW To avoid a comparative poverty, which her affection and her society would have deprived of all its horrors, I have, by raising myself to affluence, lost every thing that could make it a blessing. END
BEGIN NOW You did then, said Elinor, a little softened, believe yourself at one time attached to her? END
BEGIN NOW To have resisted such attractions, to have withstood such tenderness!&mdash;Is there a man on earth who could have done it?&mdash;Yes, I found myself, by insensible degrees, sincerely fond of her; and the happiest hours of my life were what I spent with her when I felt my intentions were strictly honourable, and my feelings blameless. END
BEGIN NOW Even THEN, however, when fully determined on paying my addresses to her, I allowed myself most improperly to put off, from day to day, the moment of doing it, from an unwillingness to enter into an engagement while my circumstances were so greatly embarrassed. END
BEGIN NOW I will not reason here&mdash;nor will I stop for YOU to expatiate on the absurdity, and the worse than absurdity, of scrupling to engage my faith where my honour was already bound. END
BEGIN NOW The event has proved, that I was a cunning fool, providing with great circumspection for a possible opportunity of making myself contemptible and wretched for ever. END
BEGIN NOW At last, however, my resolution was taken, and I had determined, as soon as I could engage her alone, to justify the attentions I had so invariably paid her, and openly assure her of an affection which I had already taken such pains to display. END
BEGIN NOW But in the interim&mdash;in the interim of the very few hours that were to pass, before I could have an opportunity of speaking with her in private&mdash;a circumstance occurred&mdash;an unlucky circumstance, to ruin all my resolution, and with it all my comfort. END
BEGIN NOW A discovery took place, &mdash;here he hesitated and looked down.&mdash; Mrs. Smith had somehow or other been informed, I imagine by some distant relation, whose interest it was to deprive me of her favour, of an affair, a connection&mdash;but I need not explain myself farther, he added, looking at her with an heightened colour and an enquiring eye&mdash; your particular intimacy&mdash;you have probably heard the whole story long ago. END
BEGIN NOW I have, returned Elinor, colouring likewise, and hardening her heart anew against any compassion for him, I have heard it all. END
BEGIN NOW And how you will explain away any part of your guilt in that dreadful business, I confess is beyond my comprehension. END
BEGIN NOW Remember, cried Willoughby, from whom you received the account. END
BEGIN NOW Could it be an impartial one? END
BEGIN NOW I acknowledge that her situation and her character ought to have been respected by me. END
BEGIN NOW I do not mean to justify myself, but at the same time cannot leave you to suppose that I have nothing to urge&mdash;that because she was injured she was irreproachable, and because I was a libertine, SHE must be a saint. END
BEGIN NOW If the violence of her passions, the weakness of her understanding&mdash;I do not mean, however, to defend myself. END
BEGIN NOW Her affection for me deserved better treatment, and I often, with great self-reproach, recall the tenderness which, for a very short time, had the power of creating any return. END
BEGIN NOW I wish&mdash;I heartily wish it had never been. END
BEGIN NOW But I have injured more than herself; and I have injured one, whose affection for me&mdash;(may I say it?) END
BEGIN NOW was scarcely less warm than hers; and whose mind&mdash;Oh! END
BEGIN NOW how infinitely superior! END
BEGIN NOW &mdash; Your indifference, however, towards that unfortunate girl&mdash;I must say it, unpleasant to me as the discussion of such a subject may well be&mdash;your indifference is no apology for your cruel neglect of her. END
BEGIN NOW Do not think yourself excused by any weakness, any natural defect of understanding on her side, in the wanton cruelty so evident on yours. END
BEGIN NOW You must have known, that while you were enjoying yourself in Devonshire pursuing fresh schemes, always gay, always happy, she was reduced to the extremest indigence. END
BEGIN NOW But, upon my soul, I did NOT know it, he warmly replied; I did not recollect that I had omitted to give her my direction; and common sense might have told her how to find it out. END
BEGIN NOW Well, sir, and what said Mrs. Smith? END
BEGIN NOW She taxed me with the offence at once, and my confusion may be guessed. END
BEGIN NOW The purity of her life, the formality of her notions, her ignorance of the world&mdash;every thing was against me. END
BEGIN NOW The matter itself I could not deny, and vain was every endeavour to soften it. END
BEGIN NOW She was previously disposed, I believe, to doubt the morality of my conduct in general, and was moreover discontented with the very little attention, the very little portion of my time that I had bestowed on her, in my present visit. END
BEGIN NOW In short, it ended in a total breach. END
BEGIN NOW By one measure I might have saved myself. END
BEGIN NOW In the height of her morality, good woman! END
BEGIN NOW she offered to forgive the past, if I would marry Eliza. END
BEGIN NOW That could not be&mdash;and I was formally dismissed from her favour and her house. END
BEGIN NOW The night following this affair&mdash;I was to go the next morning&mdash;was spent by me in deliberating on what my future conduct should be. END
BEGIN NOW The struggle was great&mdash;but it ended too soon. END
BEGIN NOW My affection for Marianne, my thorough conviction of her attachment to me&mdash;it was all insufficient to outweigh that dread of poverty, or get the better of those false ideas of the necessity of riches, which I was naturally inclined to feel, and expensive society had increased. END
BEGIN NOW I had reason to believe myself secure of my present wife, if I chose to address her, and I persuaded myself to think that nothing else in common prudence remained for me to do. END
BEGIN NOW A heavy scene however awaited me, before I could leave Devonshire;&mdash;I was engaged to dine with you on that very day; some apology was therefore necessary for my breaking this engagement. END
BEGIN NOW But whether I should write this apology, or deliver it in person, was a point of long debate. END
BEGIN NOW To see Marianne, I felt, would be dreadful, and I even doubted whether I could see her again, and keep to my resolution. END
BEGIN NOW In that point, however, I undervalued my own magnanimity, as the event declared; for I went, I saw her, and saw her miserable, and left her miserable&mdash;and left her hoping never to see her again. END
BEGIN NOW Why did you call, Mr. Willoughby? END
BEGIN NOW said Elinor, reproachfully; a note would have answered every purpose.&mdash; Why was it necessary to call? END
BEGIN NOW It was necessary to my own pride. END
BEGIN NOW I could not bear to leave the country in a manner that might lead you, or the rest of the neighbourhood, to suspect any part of what had really passed between Mrs. Smith and myself&mdash;and I resolved therefore on calling at the cottage, in my way to Honiton. END
BEGIN NOW The sight of your dear sister, however, was really dreadful; and, to heighten the matter, I found her alone. END
BEGIN NOW You were all gone I do not know where. END
BEGIN NOW I had left her only the evening before, so fully, so firmly resolved within my self on doing right! END
BEGIN NOW A few hours were to have engaged her to me for ever; and I remember how happy, how gay were my spirits, as I walked from the cottage to Allenham, satisfied with myself, delighted with every body! END
BEGIN NOW But in this, our last interview of friendship, I approached her with a sense of guilt that almost took from me the power of dissembling. END
BEGIN NOW Her sorrow, her disappointment, her deep regret, when I told her that I was obliged to leave Devonshire so immediately&mdash;I never shall forget it&mdash;united too with such reliance, such confidence in me!&mdash;Oh, God!&mdash;what a hard-hearted rascal I was! END
BEGIN NOW They were both silent for a few moments. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor first spoke. END
BEGIN NOW Did you tell her that you should soon return? END
BEGIN NOW I do not know what I told her, he replied, impatiently; less than was due to the past, beyond a doubt, and in all likelihood much more than was justified by the future. END
BEGIN NOW I cannot think of it.&mdash;It won't do.&mdash;Then came your dear mother to torture me farther, with all her kindness and confidence. END
BEGIN NOW Thank Heaven! END
BEGIN NOW it DID torture me. END
BEGIN NOW I was miserable. END
BEGIN NOW Miss Dashwood, you cannot have an idea of the comfort it gives me to look back on my own misery. END
BEGIN NOW I owe such a grudge to myself for the stupid, rascally folly of my own heart, that all my past sufferings under it are only triumph and exultation to me now. END
BEGIN NOW Well, I went, left all that I loved, and went to those to whom, at best, I was only indifferent. END
BEGIN NOW My journey to town&mdash;travelling with my own horses, and therefore so tediously&mdash;no creature to speak to&mdash;my own reflections so cheerful&mdash;when I looked forward every thing so inviting!&mdash;when I looked back at Barton, the picture so soothing!&mdash;oh, it was a blessed journey! END
BEGIN NOW He stopped. END
BEGIN NOW Well, sir, said Elinor, who, though pitying him, grew impatient for his departure, and this is all? END
BEGIN NOW Ah!&mdash;no,&mdash;have you forgot what passed in town?&mdash; That infamous letter&mdash;Did she shew it you? END
BEGIN NOW Yes, I saw every note that passed. END
BEGIN NOW When the first of hers reached me (as it immediately did, for I was in town the whole time,) what I felt is&mdash;in the common phrase, not to be expressed; in a more simple one&mdash;perhaps too simple to raise any emotion&mdash;my feelings were very, very painful.&mdash;Every line, every word was&mdash;in the hackneyed metaphor which their dear writer, were she here, would forbid&mdash;a dagger to my heart. END
BEGIN NOW To know that Marianne was in town was&mdash;in the same language&mdash;a thunderbolt.&mdash;Thunderbolts and daggers!&mdash;what a reproof would she have given me!&mdash;her taste, her opinions&mdash;I believe they are better known to me than my own,&mdash;and I am sure they are dearer. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor's heart, which had undergone many changes in the course of this extraordinary conversation, was now softened again;&mdash;yet she felt it her duty to check such ideas in her companion as the last. END
BEGIN NOW This is not right, Mr. Willoughby.&mdash;Remember that you are married. END
BEGIN NOW Relate only what in your conscience you think necessary for me to hear. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne's note, by assuring me that I was still as dear to her as in former days, that in spite of the many, many weeks we had been separated, she was as constant in her own feelings, and as full of faith in the constancy of mine as ever, awakened all my remorse. END
BEGIN NOW I say awakened, because time and London, business and dissipation, had in some measure quieted it, and I had been growing a fine hardened villain, fancying myself indifferent to her, and chusing to fancy that she too must have become indifferent to me; talking to myself of our past attachment as a mere idle, trifling business, shrugging up my shoulders in proof of its being so, and silencing every reproach, overcoming every scruple, by secretly saying now and then, 'I shall be heartily glad to hear she is well married. END
BEGIN NOW '&mdash; But this note made me know myself better. END
BEGIN NOW I felt that she was infinitely dearer to me than any other woman in the world, and that I was using her infamously. END
BEGIN NOW But every thing was then just settled between Miss Grey and me. END
BEGIN NOW To retreat was impossible. END
BEGIN NOW All that I had to do, was to avoid you both. END
BEGIN NOW I sent no answer to Marianne, intending by that to preserve myself from her farther notice; and for some time I was even determined not to call in Berkeley Street;&mdash;but at last, judging it wiser to affect the air of a cool, common acquaintance than anything else, I watched you all safely out of the house one morning, and left my name. END
BEGIN NOW Watched us out of the house! END
BEGIN NOW Even so. END
BEGIN NOW You would be surprised to hear how often I watched you, how often I was on the point of falling in with you. END
BEGIN NOW I have entered many a shop to avoid your sight, as the carriage drove by. END
BEGIN NOW Lodging as I did in Bond Street, there was hardly a day in which I did not catch a glimpse of one or other of you; and nothing but the most constant watchfulness on my side, a most invariably prevailing desire to keep out of your sight, could have separated us so long. END
BEGIN NOW I avoided the Middletons as much as possible, as well as everybody else who was likely to prove an acquaintance in common. END
BEGIN NOW Not aware of their being in town, however, I blundered on Sir John, I believe, the first day of his coming, and the day after I had called at Mrs. Jennings's. END
BEGIN NOW He asked me to a party, a dance at his house in the evening.&mdash;Had he NOT told me as an inducement that you and your sister were to be there, I should have felt it too certain a thing, to trust myself near him. END
BEGIN NOW The next morning brought another short note from Marianne&mdash;still affectionate, open, artless, confiding&mdash;everything that could make MY conduct most hateful. END
BEGIN NOW I could not answer it. END
BEGIN NOW I tried&mdash;but could not frame a sentence. END
BEGIN NOW But I thought of her, I believe, every moment of the day. END
BEGIN NOW If you CAN pity me, Miss Dashwood, pity my situation as it was THEN. END
BEGIN NOW With my head and heart full of your sister, I was forced to play the happy lover to another woman!&mdash;Those three or four weeks were worse than all. END
BEGIN NOW Well, at last, as I need not tell you, you were forced on me; and what a sweet figure I cut!&mdash;what an evening of agony it was!&mdash; Marianne, beautiful as an angel on one side, calling me Willoughby in such a tone!&mdash;Oh, God!&mdash;holding out her hand to me, asking me for an explanation, with those bewitching eyes fixed in such speaking solicitude on my face!&mdash;and Sophia, jealous as the devil on the other hand, looking all that was&mdash;Well, it does not signify; it is over now.&mdash; Such an evening!&mdash;I ran away from you all as soon as I could; but not before I had seen Marianne's sweet face as white as death.&mdash;THAT was the last, last look I ever had of her;&mdash;the last manner in which she appeared to me. END
BEGIN NOW It was a horrid sight!&mdash;yet when I thought of her to-day as really dying, it was a kind of comfort to me to imagine that I knew exactly how she would appear to those, who saw her last in this world. END
BEGIN NOW She was before me, constantly before me, as I travelled, in the same look and hue. END
BEGIN NOW A short pause of mutual thoughtfulness succeeded. END
BEGIN NOW Willoughby first rousing himself, broke it thus: Well, let me make haste and be gone. END
BEGIN NOW Your sister is certainly better, certainly out of danger? END
BEGIN NOW We are assured of it. END
BEGIN NOW Your poor mother, too!&mdash;doting on Marianne. END
BEGIN NOW But the letter, Mr. Willoughby, your own letter; have you any thing to say about that? END
BEGIN NOW Yes, yes, THAT in particular. END
BEGIN NOW Your sister wrote to me again, you know, the very next morning. END
BEGIN NOW You saw what she said. END
BEGIN NOW I was breakfasting at the Ellisons,&mdash;and her letter, with some others, was brought to me there from my lodgings. END
BEGIN NOW It happened to catch Sophia's eye before it caught mine&mdash;and its size, the elegance of the paper, the hand-writing altogether, immediately gave her a suspicion. END
BEGIN NOW Some vague report had reached her before of my attachment to some young lady in Devonshire, and what had passed within her observation the preceding evening had marked who the young lady was, and made her more jealous than ever. END
BEGIN NOW Affecting that air of playfulness, therefore, which is delightful in a woman one loves, she opened the letter directly, and read its contents. END
BEGIN NOW She was well paid for her impudence. END
BEGIN NOW She read what made her wretched. END
BEGIN NOW Her wretchedness I could have borne, but her passion&mdash;her malice&mdash;At all events it must be appeased. END
BEGIN NOW And, in short&mdash;what do you think of my wife's style of letter-writing?&mdash;delicate&mdash;tender&mdash;truly feminine&mdash;was it not? END
BEGIN NOW Your wife!&mdash;The letter was in your own hand-writing. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, but I had only the credit of servilely copying such sentences as I was ashamed to put my name to. END
BEGIN NOW The original was all her own&mdash;her own happy thoughts and gentle diction. END
BEGIN NOW But what could I do!&mdash;we were engaged, every thing in preparation, the day almost fixed&mdash;But I am talking like a fool. END
BEGIN NOW Preparation!&mdash;day!&mdash;In honest words, her money was necessary to me, and in a situation like mine, any thing was to be done to prevent a rupture. END
BEGIN NOW And after all, what did it signify to my character in the opinion of Marianne and her friends, in what language my answer was couched?&mdash;It must have been only to one end. END
BEGIN NOW My business was to declare myself a scoundrel, and whether I did it with a bow or a bluster was of little importance.&mdash; 'I am ruined for ever in their opinion&mdash;' said I to myself&mdash;'I am shut out for ever from their society, they already think me an unprincipled fellow, this letter will only make them think me a blackguard one.' END
BEGIN NOW Such were my reasonings, as, in a sort of desperate carelessness, I copied my wife's words, and parted with the last relics of Marianne. END
BEGIN NOW Her three notes&mdash;unluckily they were all in my pocketbook, or I should have denied their existence, and hoarded them for ever&mdash;I was forced to put them up, and could not even kiss them. END
BEGIN NOW And the lock of hair&mdash;that too I had always carried about me in the same pocket-book, which was now searched by Madam with the most ingratiating virulence,&mdash;the dear lock&mdash;all, every memento was torn from me. END
BEGIN NOW You are very wrong, Mr. Willoughby, very blamable, said Elinor, while her voice, in spite of herself, betrayed her compassionate emotion; you ought not to speak in this way, either of Mrs. Willoughby or my sister. END
BEGIN NOW You had made your own choice. END
BEGIN NOW It was not forced on you. END
BEGIN NOW Your wife has a claim to your politeness, to your respect, at least. END
BEGIN NOW She must be attached to you, or she would not have married you. END
BEGIN NOW To treat her with unkindness, to speak of her slightingly is no atonement to Marianne&mdash;nor can I suppose it a relief to your own conscience. END
BEGIN NOW Do not talk to me of my wife, said he with a heavy sigh.&mdash; She does not deserve your compassion.&mdash;She knew I had no regard for her when we married.&mdash;Well, married we were, and came down to Combe Magna to be happy, and afterwards returned to town to be gay.&mdash;And now do you pity me, Miss Dashwood?&mdash;or have I said all this to no purpose?&mdash; Am I&mdash;be it only one degree&mdash;am I less guilty in your opinion than I was before?&mdash;My intentions were not always wrong. END
BEGIN NOW Have I explained away any part of my guilt? END
BEGIN NOW Yes, you have certainly removed something&mdash;a little.&mdash; You have proved yourself, on the whole, less faulty than I had believed you. END
BEGIN NOW You have proved your heart less wicked, much less wicked. END
BEGIN NOW But I hardly know&mdash;the misery that you have inflicted&mdash;I hardly know what could have made it worse. END
BEGIN NOW Will you repeat to your sister when she is recovered, what I have been telling you?&mdash;Let me be a little lightened too in her opinion as well as in yours. END
BEGIN NOW You tell me that she has forgiven me already. END
BEGIN NOW Let me be able to fancy that a better knowledge of my heart, and of my present feelings, will draw from her a more spontaneous, more natural, more gentle, less dignified, forgiveness. END
BEGIN NOW Tell her of my misery and my penitence&mdash;tell her that my heart was never inconstant to her, and if you will, that at this moment she is dearer to me than ever. END
BEGIN NOW I will tell her all that is necessary to what may comparatively be called, your justification. END
BEGIN NOW But you have not explained to me the particular reason of your coming now, nor how you heard of her illness. END
BEGIN NOW Last night, in Drury Lane lobby, I ran against Sir John Middleton, and when he saw who I was&mdash;for the first time these two months&mdash;he spoke to me.&mdash;That he had cut me ever since my marriage, I had seen without surprise or resentment. END
BEGIN NOW Now, however, his good-natured, honest, stupid soul, full of indignation against me, and concern for your sister, could not resist the temptation of telling me what he knew ought to&mdash;though probably he did not think it WOULD&mdash;vex me horridly. END
BEGIN NOW As bluntly as he could speak it, therefore, he told me that Marianne Dashwood was dying of a putrid fever at Cleveland&mdash;a letter that morning received from Mrs. Jennings declared her danger most imminent&mdash;the Palmers are all gone off in a fright, &c.&mdash;I was too much shocked to be able to pass myself off as insensible even to the undiscerning Sir John. END
BEGIN NOW His heart was softened in seeing mine suffer; and so much of his ill-will was done away, that when we parted, he almost shook me by the hand while he reminded me of an old promise about a pointer puppy. END
BEGIN NOW What I felt on hearing that your sister was dying&mdash;and dying too, believing me the greatest villain upon earth, scorning, hating me in her latest moments&mdash;for how could I tell what horrid projects might not have been imputed? END
BEGIN NOW ONE person I was sure would represent me as capable of any thing&mdash; What I felt was dreadful!&mdash;My resolution was soon made, and at eight o'clock this morning I was in my carriage. END
BEGIN NOW Now you know all. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor made no answer. END
BEGIN NOW Her thoughts were silently fixed on the irreparable injury which too early an independence and its consequent habits of idleness, dissipation, and luxury, had made in the mind, the character, the happiness, of a man who, to every advantage of person and talents, united a disposition naturally open and honest, and a feeling, affectionate temper. END
BEGIN NOW The world had made him extravagant and vain&mdash;Extravagance and vanity had made him cold-hearted and selfish. END
BEGIN NOW Vanity, while seeking its own guilty triumph at the expense of another, had involved him in a real attachment, which extravagance, or at least its offspring, necessity, had required to be sacrificed. END
BEGIN NOW Each faulty propensity in leading him to evil, had led him likewise to punishment. END
BEGIN NOW The attachment, from which against honour, against feeling, against every better interest he had outwardly torn himself, now, when no longer allowable, governed every thought; and the connection, for the sake of which he had, with little scruple, left her sister to misery, was likely to prove a source of unhappiness to himself of a far more incurable nature. END
BEGIN NOW From a reverie of this kind she was recalled at the end of some minutes by Willoughby, who, rousing himself from a reverie at least equally painful, started up in preparation for going, and said&mdash; There is no use in staying here; I must be off. END
BEGIN NOW Are you going back to town? END
BEGIN NOW No&mdash;to Combe Magna. END
BEGIN NOW I have business there; from thence to town in a day or two. END
BEGIN NOW Good bye. END
BEGIN NOW He held out his hand. END
BEGIN NOW She could not refuse to give him hers;&mdash;he pressed it with affection. END
BEGIN NOW And you DO think something better of me than you did? END
BEGIN NOW &mdash;said he, letting it fall, and leaning against the mantel-piece as if forgetting he was to go. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor assured him that she did;&mdash;that she forgave, pitied, wished him well&mdash;was even interested in his happiness&mdash;and added some gentle counsel as to the behaviour most likely to promote it. END
BEGIN NOW His answer was not very encouraging. END
BEGIN NOW As to that, said he, I must rub through the world as well as I can. END
BEGIN NOW Domestic happiness is out of the question. END
BEGIN NOW If, however, I am allowed to think that you and yours feel an interest in my fate and actions, it may be the means&mdash;it may put me on my guard&mdash;at least, it may be something to live for. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne to be sure is lost to me for ever. END
BEGIN NOW Were I even by any blessed chance at liberty again&mdash; Elinor stopped him with a reproof. END
BEGIN NOW Well, &mdash;he replied&mdash; once more good bye. END
BEGIN NOW I shall now go away and live in dread of one event. END
BEGIN NOW What do you mean? END
BEGIN NOW Your sister's marriage. END
BEGIN NOW You are very wrong. END
BEGIN NOW She can never be more lost to you than she is now. END
BEGIN NOW But she will be gained by some one else. END
BEGIN NOW And if that some one should be the very he whom, of all others, I could least bear&mdash;but I will not stay to rob myself of all your compassionate goodwill, by shewing that where I have most injured I can least forgive. END
BEGIN NOW Good bye,&mdash;God bless you! END
BEGIN NOW And with these words, he almost ran out of the room. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor, for some time after he left her, for some time even after the sound of his carriage had died away, remained too much oppressed by a crowd of ideas, widely differing in themselves, but of which sadness was the general result, to think even of her sister. END
BEGIN NOW Willoughby, he, whom only half an hour ago she had abhorred as the most worthless of men, Willoughby, in spite of all his faults, excited a degree of commiseration for the sufferings produced by them, which made her think of him as now separated for ever from her family, with a tenderness, a regret, rather in proportion, as she soon acknowledged within herself&mdash;to his wishes than to his merits. END
BEGIN NOW She felt that his influence over her mind was heightened by circumstances which ought not in reason to have weight; by that person of uncommon attraction, that open, affectionate, and lively manner which it was no merit to possess; and by that still ardent love for Marianne, which it was not even innocent to indulge. END
BEGIN NOW But she felt that it was so, long, long before she could feel his influence less. END
BEGIN NOW When at last she returned to the unconscious Marianne, she found her just awaking, refreshed by so long and sweet a sleep to the extent of her hopes. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor's heart was full. END
BEGIN NOW The past, the present, the future, Willoughby's visit, Marianne's safety, and her mother's expected arrival, threw her altogether into an agitation of spirits which kept off every indication of fatigue, and made her only fearful of betraying herself to her sister. END
BEGIN NOW Short was the time, however, in which that fear could affect her, for within half an hour after Willoughby's leaving the house, she was again called down stairs by the sound of another carriage.&mdash;Eager to save her mother from every unnecessary moment's horrible suspense, she ran immediately into the hall, and reached the outward door just in time to receive and support her as she entered it. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Dashwood, whose terror as they drew near the house had produced almost the conviction of Marianne's being no more, had no voice to inquire after her, no voice even for Elinor; but SHE, waiting neither for salutation nor inquiry, instantly gave the joyful relief;&mdash;and her mother, catching it with all her usual warmth, was in a moment as much overcome by her happiness, as she had been before by her fears. END
BEGIN NOW She was supported into the drawing-room between her daughter and her friend;&mdash;and there, shedding tears of joy, though still unable to speak, embraced Elinor again and again, turning from her at intervals to press Colonel Brandon's hand, with a look which spoke at once her gratitude, and her conviction of his sharing with herself in the bliss of the moment. END
BEGIN NOW He shared it, however, in a silence even greater than her own. END
BEGIN NOW As soon as Mrs. Dashwood had recovered herself, to see Marianne was her first desire; and in two minutes she was with her beloved child, rendered dearer to her than ever by absence, unhappiness, and danger. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor's delight, as she saw what each felt in the meeting, was only checked by an apprehension of its robbing Marianne of farther sleep;&mdash;but Mrs. Dashwood could be calm, could be even prudent, when the life of a child was at stake, and Marianne, satisfied in knowing her mother was near her, and conscious of being too weak for conversation, submitted readily to the silence and quiet prescribed by every nurse around her. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Dashwood WOULD sit up with her all night; and Elinor, in compliance with her mother's entreaty, went to bed. END
BEGIN NOW But the rest, which one night entirely sleepless, and many hours of the most wearing anxiety seemed to make requisite, was kept off by irritation of spirits. END
BEGIN NOW Willoughby, poor Willoughby, as she now allowed herself to call him, was constantly in her thoughts; she would not but have heard his vindication for the world, and now blamed, now acquitted herself for having judged him so harshly before. END
BEGIN NOW But her promise of relating it to her sister was invariably painful. END
BEGIN NOW She dreaded the performance of it, dreaded what its effect on Marianne might be; doubted whether after such an explanation she could ever be happy with another; and for a moment wished Willoughby a widower. END
BEGIN NOW Then, remembering Colonel Brandon, reproved herself, felt that to HIS sufferings and his constancy far more than to his rival's, the reward of her sister was due, and wished any thing rather than Mrs. Willoughby's death. END
BEGIN NOW The shock of Colonel Brandon's errand at Barton had been much softened to Mrs. Dashwood by her own previous alarm; for so great was her uneasiness about Marianne, that she had already determined to set out for Cleveland on that very day, without waiting for any further intelligence, and had so far settled her journey before his arrival, that the Careys were then expected every moment to fetch Margaret away, as her mother was unwilling to take her where there might be infection. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne continued to mend every day, and the brilliant cheerfulness of Mrs. Dashwood's looks and spirits proved her to be, as she repeatedly declared herself, one of the happiest women in the world. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor could not hear the declaration, nor witness its proofs without sometimes wondering whether her mother ever recollected Edward. END
BEGIN NOW But Mrs. Dashwood, trusting to the temperate account of her own disappointment which Elinor had sent her, was led away by the exuberance of her joy to think only of what would increase it. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne was restored to her from a danger in which, as she now began to feel, her own mistaken judgment in encouraging the unfortunate attachment to Willoughby, had contributed to place her;&mdash;and in her recovery she had yet another source of joy unthought of by Elinor. END
BEGIN NOW It was thus imparted to her, as soon as any opportunity of private conference between them occurred. END
BEGIN NOW At last we are alone. END
BEGIN NOW My Elinor, you do not yet know all my happiness. END
BEGIN NOW Colonel Brandon loves Marianne. END
BEGIN NOW He has told me so himself. END
BEGIN NOW Her daughter, feeling by turns both pleased and pained, surprised and not surprised, was all silent attention. END
BEGIN NOW You are never like me, dear Elinor, or I should wonder at your composure now. END
BEGIN NOW Had I sat down to wish for any possible good to my family, I should have fixed on Colonel Brandon's marrying one of you as the object most desirable. END
BEGIN NOW And I believe Marianne will be the most happy with him of the two. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor was half inclined to ask her reason for thinking so, because satisfied that none founded on an impartial consideration of their age, characters, or feelings, could be given;&mdash;but her mother must always be carried away by her imagination on any interesting subject, and therefore instead of an inquiry, she passed it off with a smile. END
BEGIN NOW He opened his whole heart to me yesterday as we travelled. END
BEGIN NOW It came out quite unawares, quite undesignedly. END
BEGIN NOW I, you may well believe, could talk of nothing but my child;&mdash;he could not conceal his distress; I saw that it equalled my own, and he perhaps, thinking that mere friendship, as the world now goes, would not justify so warm a sympathy&mdash;or rather, not thinking at all, I suppose&mdash;giving way to irresistible feelings, made me acquainted with his earnest, tender, constant, affection for Marianne. END
BEGIN NOW He has loved her, my Elinor, ever since the first moment of seeing her. END
BEGIN NOW Here, however, Elinor perceived,&mdash;not the language, not the professions of Colonel Brandon, but the natural embellishments of her mother's active fancy, which fashioned every thing delightful to her as it chose. END
BEGIN NOW His regard for her, infinitely surpassing anything that Willoughby ever felt or feigned, as much more warm, as more sincere or constant&mdash;which ever we are to call it&mdash;has subsisted through all the knowledge of dear Marianne's unhappy prepossession for that worthless young man!&mdash;and without selfishness&mdash;without encouraging a hope!&mdash;could he have seen her happy with another&mdash;Such a noble mind!&mdash;such openness, such sincerity!&mdash;no one can be deceived in HIM. END
BEGIN NOW Colonel Brandon's character, said Elinor, as an excellent man, is well established. END
BEGIN NOW I know it is, &mdash;replied her mother seriously, or after such a warning, I should be the last to encourage such affection, or even to be pleased by it. END
BEGIN NOW But his coming for me as he did, with such active, such ready friendship, is enough to prove him one of the worthiest of men. END
BEGIN NOW His character, however, answered Elinor, does not rest on ONE act of kindness, to which his affection for Marianne, were humanity out of the case, would have prompted him. END
BEGIN NOW To Mrs. Jennings, to the Middletons, he has been long and intimately known; they equally love and respect him; and even my own knowledge of him, though lately acquired, is very considerable; and so highly do I value and esteem him, that if Marianne can be happy with him, I shall be as ready as yourself to think our connection the greatest blessing to us in the world. END
BEGIN NOW What answer did you give him?&mdash;Did you allow him to hope? END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW my love, I could not then talk of hope to him or to myself. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne might at that moment be dying. END
BEGIN NOW But he did not ask for hope or encouragement. END
BEGIN NOW His was an involuntary confidence, an irrepressible effusion to a soothing friend&mdash;not an application to a parent. END
BEGIN NOW Yet after a time I DID say, for at first I was quite overcome&mdash;that if she lived, as I trusted she might, my greatest happiness would lie in promoting their marriage; and since our arrival, since our delightful security, I have repeated it to him more fully, have given him every encouragement in my power. END
BEGIN NOW Time, a very little time, I tell him, will do everything;&mdash;Marianne's heart is not to be wasted for ever on such a man as Willoughby.&mdash; His own merits must soon secure it. END
BEGIN NOW To judge from the Colonel's spirits, however, you have not yet made him equally sanguine. END
BEGIN NOW No.&mdash;He thinks Marianne's affection too deeply rooted for any change in it under a great length of time, and even supposing her heart again free, is too diffident of himself to believe, that with such a difference of age and disposition he could ever attach her. END
BEGIN NOW There, however, he is quite mistaken. END
BEGIN NOW His age is only so much beyond hers as to be an advantage, as to make his character and principles fixed;&mdash;and his disposition, I am well convinced, is exactly the very one to make your sister happy. END
BEGIN NOW And his person, his manners too, are all in his favour. END
BEGIN NOW My partiality does not blind me; he certainly is not so handsome as Willoughby&mdash;but at the same time, there is something much more pleasing in his countenance.&mdash; There was always a something,&mdash;if you remember,&mdash;in Willoughby's eyes at times, which I did not like. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor could NOT remember it;&mdash;but her mother, without waiting for her assent, continued, And his manners, the Colonel's manners are not only more pleasing to me than Willoughby's ever were, but they are of a kind I well know to be more solidly attaching to Marianne. END
BEGIN NOW Their gentleness, their genuine attention to other people, and their manly unstudied simplicity is much more accordant with her real disposition, than the liveliness&mdash;often artificial, and often ill-timed of the other. END
BEGIN NOW I am very sure myself, that had Willoughby turned out as really amiable, as he has proved himself the contrary, Marianne would yet never have been so happy with HIM, as she will be with Colonel Brandon. END
BEGIN NOW She paused.&mdash;Her daughter could not quite agree with her, but her dissent was not heard, and therefore gave no offence. END
BEGIN NOW At Delaford, she will be within an easy distance of me, added Mrs. Dashwood, even if I remain at Barton; and in all probability,&mdash;for I hear it is a large village,&mdash;indeed there certainly MUST be some small house or cottage close by, that would suit us quite as well as our present situation. END
BEGIN NOW Poor Elinor!&mdash;here was a new scheme for getting her to Delaford!&mdash;but her spirit was stubborn. END
BEGIN NOW His fortune too!&mdash;for at my time of life you know, everybody cares about THAT;&mdash;and though I neither know nor desire to know, what it really is, I am sure it must be a good one. END
BEGIN NOW Here they were interrupted by the entrance of a third person, and Elinor withdrew to think it all over in private, to wish success to her friend, and yet in wishing it, to feel a pang for Willoughby. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne's illness, though weakening in its kind, had not been long enough to make her recovery slow; and with youth, natural strength, and her mother's presence in aid, it proceeded so smoothly as to enable her to remove, within four days after the arrival of the latter, into Mrs. Palmer's dressing-room. END
BEGIN NOW When there, at her own particular request, for she was impatient to pour forth her thanks to him for fetching her mother, Colonel Brandon was invited to visit her. END
BEGIN NOW His emotion on entering the room, in seeing her altered looks, and in receiving the pale hand which she immediately held out to him, was such, as, in Elinor's conjecture, must arise from something more than his affection for Marianne, or the consciousness of its being known to others; and she soon discovered in his melancholy eye and varying complexion as he looked at her sister, the probable recurrence of many past scenes of misery to his mind, brought back by that resemblance between Marianne and Eliza already acknowledged, and now strengthened by the hollow eye, the sickly skin, the posture of reclining weakness, and the warm acknowledgment of peculiar obligation. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Dashwood, not less watchful of what passed than her daughter, but with a mind very differently influenced, and therefore watching to very different effect, saw nothing in the Colonel's behaviour but what arose from the most simple and self-evident sensations, while in the actions and words of Marianne she persuaded herself to think that something more than gratitude already dawned. END
BEGIN NOW At the end of another day or two, Marianne growing visibly stronger every twelve hours, Mrs. Dashwood, urged equally by her own and her daughter's wishes, began to talk of removing to Barton. END
BEGIN NOW On HER measures depended those of her two friends; Mrs. Jennings could not quit Cleveland during the Dashwoods' stay; and Colonel Brandon was soon brought, by their united request, to consider his own abode there as equally determinate, if not equally indispensable. END
BEGIN NOW At his and Mrs. Jennings's united request in return, Mrs. Dashwood was prevailed on to accept the use of his carriage on her journey back, for the better accommodation of her sick child; and the Colonel, at the joint invitation of Mrs. Dashwood and Mrs. Jennings, whose active good-nature made her friendly and hospitable for other people as well as herself, engaged with pleasure to redeem it by a visit at the cottage, in the course of a few weeks. END
BEGIN NOW The day of separation and departure arrived; and Marianne, after taking so particular and lengthened a leave of Mrs. Jennings, one so earnestly grateful, so full of respect and kind wishes as seemed due to her own heart from a secret acknowledgment of past inattention, and bidding Colonel Brandon farewell with a cordiality of a friend, was carefully assisted by him into the carriage, of which he seemed anxious that she should engross at least half. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor then followed, and the others were left by themselves, to talk of the travellers, and feel their own dullness, till Mrs. Jennings was summoned to her chaise to take comfort in the gossip of her maid for the loss of her two young companions; and Colonel Brandon immediately afterwards took his solitary way to Delaford. END
BEGIN NOW The Dashwoods were two days on the road, and Marianne bore her journey on both, without essential fatigue. END
BEGIN NOW Every thing that the most zealous affection, the most solicitous care could do to render her comfortable, was the office of each watchful companion, and each found their reward in her bodily ease, and her calmness of spirits. END
BEGIN NOW To Elinor, the observation of the latter was particularly grateful. END
BEGIN NOW She, who had seen her week after week so constantly suffering, oppressed by anguish of heart which she had neither courage to speak of, nor fortitude to conceal, now saw with a joy, which no other could equally share, an apparent composure of mind, which, in being the result as she trusted of serious reflection, must eventually lead her to contentment and cheerfulness. END
BEGIN NOW As they approached Barton, indeed, and entered on scenes of which every field and every tree brought some peculiar, some painful recollection, she grew silent and thoughtful, and turning away her face from their notice, sat earnestly gazing through the window. END
BEGIN NOW But here, Elinor could neither wonder nor blame; and when she saw, as she assisted Marianne from the carriage, that she had been crying, she saw only an emotion too natural in itself to raise any thing less tender than pity, and in its unobtrusiveness entitled to praise. END
BEGIN NOW In the whole of her subsequent manner, she traced the direction of a mind awakened to reasonable exertion; for no sooner had they entered their common sitting-room, than Marianne turned her eyes around it with a look of resolute firmness, as if determined at once to accustom herself to the sight of every object with which the remembrance of Willoughby could be connected.&mdash;She said little, but every sentence aimed at cheerfulness, and though a sigh sometimes escaped her, it never passed away without the atonement of a smile. END
BEGIN NOW After dinner she would try her piano-forte. END
BEGIN NOW She went to it; but the music on which her eye first rested was an opera, procured for her by Willoughby, containing some of their favourite duets, and bearing on its outward leaf her own name in his hand-writing.&mdash;That would not do.&mdash;She shook her head, put the music aside, and after running over the keys for a minute, complained of feebleness in her fingers, and closed the instrument again; declaring however with firmness as she did so, that she should in future practice much. END
BEGIN NOW The next morning produced no abatement in these happy symptoms. END
BEGIN NOW On the contrary, with a mind and body alike strengthened by rest, she looked and spoke with more genuine spirit, anticipating the pleasure of Margaret's return, and talking of the dear family party which would then be restored, of their mutual pursuits and cheerful society, as the only happiness worth a wish. END
BEGIN NOW When the weather is settled, and I have recovered my strength, said she, we will take long walks together every day. END
BEGIN NOW We will walk to the farm at the edge of the down, and see how the children go on; we will walk to Sir John's new plantations at Barton Cross, and the Abbeyland; and we will often go to the old ruins of the Priory, and try to trace its foundations as far as we are told they once reached. END
BEGIN NOW I know we shall be happy. END
BEGIN NOW I know the summer will pass happily away. END
BEGIN NOW I mean never to be later in rising than six, and from that time till dinner I shall divide every moment between music and reading. END
BEGIN NOW I have formed my plan, and am determined to enter on a course of serious study. END
BEGIN NOW Our own library is too well known to me, to be resorted to for any thing beyond mere amusement. END
BEGIN NOW But there are many works well worth reading at the Park; and there are others of more modern production which I know I can borrow of Colonel Brandon. END
BEGIN NOW By reading only six hours a-day, I shall gain in the course of a twelve-month a great deal of instruction which I now feel myself to want. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor honoured her for a plan which originated so nobly as this; though smiling to see the same eager fancy which had been leading her to the extreme of languid indolence and selfish repining, now at work in introducing excess into a scheme of such rational employment and virtuous self-control. END
BEGIN NOW Her smile however changed to a sigh when she remembered that promise to Willoughby was yet unfulfilled, and feared she had that to communicate which might again unsettle the mind of Marianne, and ruin at least for a time this fair prospect of busy tranquillity. END
BEGIN NOW Willing therefore to delay the evil hour, she resolved to wait till her sister's health were more secure, before she appointed it. END
BEGIN NOW But the resolution was made only to be broken. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne had been two or three days at home, before the weather was fine enough for an invalid like herself to venture out. END
BEGIN NOW But at last a soft, genial morning appeared; such as might tempt the daughter's wishes and the mother's confidence; and Marianne, leaning on Elinor's arm, was authorised to walk as long as she could without fatigue, in the lane before the house. END
BEGIN NOW The sisters set out at a pace, slow as the feebleness of Marianne in an exercise hitherto untried since her illness required;&mdash;and they had advanced only so far beyond the house as to admit a full view of the hill, the important hill behind, when pausing with her eyes turned towards it, Marianne calmly said, There, exactly there, &mdash;pointing with one hand, on that projecting mound,&mdash;there I fell; and there I first saw Willoughby. END
BEGIN NOW Her voice sunk with the word, but presently reviving she added, I am thankful to find that I can look with so little pain on the spot!&mdash;shall we ever talk on that subject, Elinor? END
BEGIN NOW &mdash;hesitatingly it was said.&mdash; Or will it be wrong?&mdash;I can talk of it now, I hope, as I ought to do. END
BEGIN NOW &mdash; Elinor tenderly invited her to be open. END
BEGIN NOW As for regret, said Marianne, I have done with that, as far as HE is concerned. END
BEGIN NOW I do not mean to talk to you of what my feelings have been for him, but what they are NOW.&mdash;At present, if I could be satisfied on one point, if I could be allowed to think that he was not ALWAYS acting a part, not ALWAYS deceiving me;&mdash;but above all, if I could be assured that he never was so VERY wicked as my fears have sometimes fancied him, since the story of that unfortunate girl &mdash; She stopt. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor joyfully treasured her words as she answered, If you could be assured of that, you think you should be easy. END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW My peace of mind is doubly involved in it;&mdash;for not only is it horrible to suspect a person, who has been what HE has been to ME, of such designs,&mdash;but what must it make me appear to myself?&mdash;What in a situation like mine, but a most shamefully unguarded affection could expose me to &mdash; How then, asked her sister, would you account for his behaviour? END
BEGIN NOW I would suppose him,&mdash;Oh, how gladly would I suppose him, only fickle, very, very fickle. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor said no more. END
BEGIN NOW She was debating within herself on the eligibility of beginning her story directly, or postponing it till Marianne were in stronger health;&mdash;and they crept on for a few minutes in silence. END
BEGIN NOW I am not wishing him too much good, said Marianne at last with a sigh, when I wish his secret reflections may be no more unpleasant than my own. END
BEGIN NOW He will suffer enough in them. END
BEGIN NOW Do you compare your conduct with his? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW I compare it with what it ought to have been; I compare it with yours. END
BEGIN NOW Our situations have borne little resemblance. END
BEGIN NOW They have borne more than our conduct.&mdash;Do not, my dearest Elinor, let your kindness defend what I know your judgment must censure. END
BEGIN NOW My illness has made me think&mdash; It has given me leisure and calmness for serious recollection. END
BEGIN NOW Long before I was enough recovered to talk, I was perfectly able to reflect. END
BEGIN NOW I considered the past: I saw in my own behaviour, since the beginning of our acquaintance with him last autumn, nothing but a series of imprudence towards myself, and want of kindness to others. END
BEGIN NOW I saw that my own feelings had prepared my sufferings, and that my want of fortitude under them had almost led me to the grave. END
BEGIN NOW My illness, I well knew, had been entirely brought on by myself by such negligence of my own health, as I had felt even at the time to be wrong. END
BEGIN NOW Had I died,&mdash;it would have been self-destruction. END
BEGIN NOW I did not know my danger till the danger was removed; but with such feelings as these reflections gave me, I wonder at my recovery,&mdash;wonder that the very eagerness of my desire to live, to have time for atonement to my God, and to you all, did not kill me at once. END
BEGIN NOW Had I died,&mdash;in what peculiar misery should I have left you, my nurse, my friend, my sister!&mdash;You, who had seen all the fretful selfishness of my latter days; who had known all the murmurings of my heart!&mdash;How should I have lived in YOUR remembrance!&mdash;My mother too! END
BEGIN NOW How could you have consoled her!&mdash;I cannot express my own abhorrence of myself. END
BEGIN NOW Whenever I looked towards the past, I saw some duty neglected, or some failing indulged. END
BEGIN NOW Every body seemed injured by me. END
BEGIN NOW The kindness, the unceasing kindness of Mrs. Jennings, I had repaid with ungrateful contempt. END
BEGIN NOW To the Middletons, to the Palmers, the Steeles, to every common acquaintance even, I had been insolent and unjust; with a heart hardened against their merits, and a temper irritated by their very attention.&mdash;To John, to Fanny,&mdash;yes, even to them, little as they deserve, I had given less than their due. END
BEGIN NOW But you,&mdash;you above all, above my mother, had been wronged by me. END
BEGIN NOW I, and only I, knew your heart and its sorrows; yet to what did it influence me?&mdash;not to any compassion that could benefit you or myself.&mdash;Your example was before me; but to what avail?&mdash;Was I more considerate of you and your comfort? END
BEGIN NOW Did I imitate your forbearance, or lessen your restraints, by taking any part in those offices of general complaisance or particular gratitude which you had hitherto been left to discharge alone?&mdash;No;&mdash;not less when I knew you to be unhappy, than when I had believed you at ease, did I turn away from every exertion of duty or friendship; scarcely allowing sorrow to exist but with me, regretting only THAT heart which had deserted and wronged me, and leaving you, for whom I professed an unbounded affection, to be miserable for my sake. END
BEGIN NOW Here ceased the rapid flow of her self-reproving spirit; and Elinor, impatient to soothe, though too honest to flatter, gave her instantly that praise and support which her frankness and her contrition so well deserved. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne pressed her hand and replied, You are very good.&mdash;The future must be my proof. END
BEGIN NOW I have laid down my plan, and if I am capable of adhering to it&mdash;my feelings shall be governed and my temper improved. END
BEGIN NOW They shall no longer worry others, nor torture myself. END
BEGIN NOW I shall now live solely for my family. END
BEGIN NOW You, my mother, and Margaret, must henceforth be all the world to me; you will share my affections entirely between you. END
BEGIN NOW From you, from my home, I shall never again have the smallest incitement to move; and if I do mix in other society, it will be only to shew that my spirit is humbled, my heart amended, and that I can practise the civilities, the lesser duties of life, with gentleness and forbearance. END
BEGIN NOW As for Willoughby&mdash;to say that I shall soon or that I shall ever forget him, would be idle. END
BEGIN NOW His remembrance can be overcome by no change of circumstances or opinions. END
BEGIN NOW But it shall be regulated, it shall be checked by religion, by reason, by constant employment. END
BEGIN NOW She paused&mdash;and added in a low voice, If I could but know HIS heart, everything would become easy. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor, who had now been for some time reflecting on the propriety or impropriety of speedily hazarding her narration, without feeling at all nearer decision than at first, heard this; and perceiving that as reflection did nothing, resolution must do all, soon found herself leading to the fact. END
BEGIN NOW She managed the recital, as she hoped, with address; prepared her anxious listener with caution; related simply and honestly the chief points on which Willoughby grounded his apology; did justice to his repentance, and softened only his protestations of present regard. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne said not a word.&mdash;She trembled, her eyes were fixed on the ground, and her lips became whiter than even sickness had left them. END
BEGIN NOW A thousand inquiries sprung up from her heart, but she dared not urge one. END
BEGIN NOW She caught every syllable with panting eagerness; her hand, unknowingly to herself, closely pressed her sister's, and tears covered her cheeks. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor, dreading her being tired, led her towards home; and till they reached the door of the cottage, easily conjecturing what her curiosity must be though no question was suffered to speak it, talked of nothing but Willoughby, and their conversation together; and was carefully minute in every particular of speech and look, where minuteness could be safely indulged. END
BEGIN NOW As soon as they entered the house, Marianne with a kiss of gratitude and these two words just articulate through her tears, Tell mama, withdrew from her sister and walked slowly up stairs. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor would not attempt to disturb a solitude so reasonable as what she now sought; and with a mind anxiously pre-arranging its result, and a resolution of reviving the subject again, should Marianne fail to do it, she turned into the parlour to fulfill her parting injunction. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Dashwood did not hear unmoved the vindication of her former favourite. END
BEGIN NOW She rejoiced in his being cleared from some part of his imputed guilt;&mdash;she was sorry for him;&mdash;she wished him happy. END
BEGIN NOW But the feelings of the past could not be recalled.&mdash;Nothing could restore him with a faith unbroken&mdash;a character unblemished, to Marianne. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing could do away the knowledge of what the latter had suffered through his means, nor remove the guilt of his conduct towards Eliza. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing could replace him, therefore, in her former esteem, nor injure the interests of Colonel Brandon. END
BEGIN NOW Had Mrs. Dashwood, like her daughter, heard Willoughby's story from himself&mdash;had she witnessed his distress, and been under the influence of his countenance and his manner, it is probable that her compassion would have been greater. END
BEGIN NOW But it was neither in Elinor's power, nor in her wish, to rouse such feelings in another, by her retailed explanation, as had at first been called forth in herself. END
BEGIN NOW Reflection had given calmness to her judgment, and sobered her own opinion of Willoughby's deserts;&mdash;she wished, therefore, to declare only the simple truth, and lay open such facts as were really due to his character, without any embellishment of tenderness to lead the fancy astray. END
BEGIN NOW In the evening, when they were all three together, Marianne began voluntarily to speak of him again;&mdash;but that it was not without an effort, the restless, unquiet thoughtfulness in which she had been for some time previously sitting&mdash;her rising colour, as she spoke,&mdash;and her unsteady voice, plainly shewed. END
BEGIN NOW I wish to assure you both, said she, that I see every thing&mdash;as you can desire me to do. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Dashwood would have interrupted her instantly with soothing tenderness, had not Elinor, who really wished to hear her sister's unbiased opinion, by an eager sign, engaged her silence. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne slowly continued&mdash; It is a great relief to me&mdash;what Elinor told me this morning&mdash;I have now heard exactly what I wished to hear. END
BEGIN NOW &mdash;For some moments her voice was lost; but recovering herself, she added, and with greater calmness than before&mdash; I am now perfectly satisfied, I wish for no change. END
BEGIN NOW I never could have been happy with him, after knowing, as sooner or later I must have known, all this.&mdash;I should have had no confidence, no esteem. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing could have done it away to my feelings. END
BEGIN NOW I know it&mdash;I know it, cried her mother. END
BEGIN NOW Happy with a man of libertine practices!&mdash;With one who so injured the peace of the dearest of our friends, and the best of men!&mdash;No&mdash;my Marianne has not a heart to be made happy with such a man!&mdash;Her conscience, her sensitive conscience, would have felt all that the conscience of her husband ought to have felt. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne sighed, and repeated, I wish for no change. END
BEGIN NOW You consider the matter, said Elinor, exactly as a good mind and a sound understanding must consider it; and I dare say you perceive, as well as myself, not only in this, but in many other circumstances, reason enough to be convinced that your marriage must have involved you in many certain troubles and disappointments, in which you would have been poorly supported by an affection, on his side, much less certain. END
BEGIN NOW Had you married, you must have been always poor. END
BEGIN NOW His expensiveness is acknowledged even by himself, and his whole conduct declares that self-denial is a word hardly understood by him. END
BEGIN NOW His demands and your inexperience together, on a small, very small income, must have brought on distresses which would not be the LESS grievous to you, from having been entirely unknown and unthought of before. END
BEGIN NOW YOUR sense of honour and honesty would have led you, I know, when aware of your situation, to attempt all the economy that would appear to you possible: and, perhaps, as long as your frugality retrenched only on your own comfort, you might have been suffered to practice it, but beyond that&mdash;and how little could the utmost of your single management do to stop the ruin which had begun before your marriage?&mdash; Beyond THAT, had you endeavoured, however reasonably, to abridge HIS enjoyments, is it not to be feared, that instead of prevailing on feelings so selfish to consent to it, you would have lessened your own influence on his heart, and made him regret the connection which had involved him in such difficulties? END
BEGIN NOW Marianne's lips quivered, and she repeated the word Selfish? END
BEGIN NOW in a tone that implied&mdash; do you really think him selfish? END
BEGIN NOW The whole of his behaviour, replied Elinor, from the beginning to the end of the affair, has been grounded on selfishness. END
BEGIN NOW It was selfishness which first made him sport with your affections; which afterwards, when his own were engaged, made him delay the confession of it, and which finally carried him from Barton. END
BEGIN NOW His own enjoyment, or his own ease, was, in every particular, his ruling principle. END
BEGIN NOW It is very true. END
BEGIN NOW MY happiness never was his object. END
BEGIN NOW At present, continued Elinor, he regrets what he has done. END
BEGIN NOW And why does he regret it?&mdash;Because he finds it has not answered towards himself. END
BEGIN NOW It has not made him happy. END
BEGIN NOW His circumstances are now unembarrassed&mdash;he suffers from no evil of that kind; and he thinks only that he has married a woman of a less amiable temper than yourself. END
BEGIN NOW But does it follow that had he married you, he would have been happy?&mdash;The inconveniences would have been different. END
BEGIN NOW He would then have suffered under the pecuniary distresses which, because they are removed, he now reckons as nothing. END
BEGIN NOW He would have had a wife of whose temper he could make no complaint, but he would have been always necessitous&mdash;always poor; and probably would soon have learned to rank the innumerable comforts of a clear estate and good income as of far more importance, even to domestic happiness, than the mere temper of a wife. END
BEGIN NOW I have not a doubt of it, said Marianne; and I have nothing to regret&mdash;nothing but my own folly. END
BEGIN NOW Rather say your mother's imprudence, my child, said Mrs. Dashwood; SHE must be answerable. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne would not let her proceed;&mdash;and Elinor, satisfied that each felt their own error, wished to avoid any survey of the past that might weaken her sister's spirits; she, therefore, pursuing the first subject, immediately continued, One observation may, I think, be fairly drawn from the whole of the story&mdash;that all Willoughby's difficulties have arisen from the first offence against virtue, in his behaviour to Eliza Williams. END
BEGIN NOW That crime has been the origin of every lesser one, and of all his present discontents. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne assented most feelingly to the remark; and her mother was led by it to an enumeration of Colonel Brandon's injuries and merits, warm as friendship and design could unitedly dictate. END
BEGIN NOW Her daughter did not look, however, as if much of it were heard by her. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor, according to her expectation, saw on the two or three following days, that Marianne did not continue to gain strength as she had done; but while her resolution was unsubdued, and she still tried to appear cheerful and easy, her sister could safely trust to the effect of time upon her health. END
BEGIN NOW Margaret returned, and the family were again all restored to each other, again quietly settled at the cottage; and if not pursuing their usual studies with quite so much vigour as when they first came to Barton, at least planning a vigorous prosecution of them in future. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor grew impatient for some tidings of Edward. END
BEGIN NOW She had heard nothing of him since her leaving London, nothing new of his plans, nothing certain even of his present abode. END
BEGIN NOW Some letters had passed between her and her brother, in consequence of Marianne's illness; and in the first of John's, there had been this sentence:&mdash; We know nothing of our unfortunate Edward, and can make no enquiries on so prohibited a subject, but conclude him to be still at Oxford; which was all the intelligence of Edward afforded her by the correspondence, for his name was not even mentioned in any of the succeeding letters. END
BEGIN NOW She was not doomed, however, to be long in ignorance of his measures. END
BEGIN NOW Their man-servant had been sent one morning to Exeter on business; and when, as he waited at table, he had satisfied the inquiries of his mistress as to the event of his errand, this was his voluntary communication&mdash; I suppose you know, ma'am, that Mr. Ferrars is married. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne gave a violent start, fixed her eyes upon Elinor, saw her turning pale, and fell back in her chair in hysterics. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Dashwood, whose eyes, as she answered the servant's inquiry, had intuitively taken the same direction, was shocked to perceive by Elinor's countenance how much she really suffered, and a moment afterwards, alike distressed by Marianne's situation, knew not on which child to bestow her principal attention. END
BEGIN NOW The servant, who saw only that Miss Marianne was taken ill, had sense enough to call one of the maids, who, with Mrs. Dashwood's assistance, supported her into the other room. END
BEGIN NOW By that time, Marianne was rather better, and her mother leaving her to the care of Margaret and the maid, returned to Elinor, who, though still much disordered, had so far recovered the use of her reason and voice as to be just beginning an inquiry of Thomas, as to the source of his intelligence. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Dashwood immediately took all that trouble on herself; and Elinor had the benefit of the information without the exertion of seeking it. END
BEGIN NOW Who told you that Mr. Ferrars was married, Thomas? END
BEGIN NOW I see Mr. Ferrars myself, ma'am, this morning in Exeter, and his lady too, Miss Steele as was. END
BEGIN NOW They was stopping in a chaise at the door of the New London Inn, as I went there with a message from Sally at the Park to her brother, who is one of the post-boys. END
BEGIN NOW I happened to look up as I went by the chaise, and so I see directly it was the youngest Miss Steele; so I took off my hat, and she knew me and called to me, and inquired after you, ma'am, and the young ladies, especially Miss Marianne, and bid me I should give her compliments and Mr. Ferrars's, their best compliments and service, and how sorry they was they had not time to come on and see you, but they was in a great hurry to go forwards, for they was going further down for a little while, but howsever, when they come back, they'd make sure to come and see you. END
BEGIN NOW But did she tell you she was married, Thomas? END
BEGIN NOW Yes, ma'am. END
BEGIN NOW She smiled, and said how she had changed her name since she was in these parts. END
BEGIN NOW She was always a very affable and free-spoken young lady, and very civil behaved. END
BEGIN NOW So, I made free to wish her joy. END
BEGIN NOW Was Mr. Ferrars in the carriage with her? END
BEGIN NOW Yes, ma'am, I just see him leaning back in it, but he did not look up;&mdash;he never was a gentleman much for talking. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor's heart could easily account for his not putting himself forward; and Mrs. Dashwood probably found the same explanation. END
BEGIN NOW Was there no one else in the carriage? END
BEGIN NOW No, ma'am, only they two. END
BEGIN NOW Do you know where they came from? END
BEGIN NOW They come straight from town, as Miss Lucy&mdash;Mrs. Ferrars told me. END
BEGIN NOW And are they going farther westward? END
BEGIN NOW Yes, ma'am&mdash;but not to bide long. END
BEGIN NOW They will soon be back again, and then they'd be sure and call here. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Dashwood now looked at her daughter; but Elinor knew better than to expect them. END
BEGIN NOW She recognised the whole of Lucy in the message, and was very confident that Edward would never come near them. END
BEGIN NOW She observed in a low voice, to her mother, that they were probably going down to Mr. Pratt's, near Plymouth. END
BEGIN NOW Thomas's intelligence seemed over. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor looked as if she wished to hear more. END
BEGIN NOW Did you see them off, before you came away? END
BEGIN NOW No, ma'am&mdash;the horses were just coming out, but I could not bide any longer; I was afraid of being late. END
BEGIN NOW Did Mrs. Ferrars look well? END
BEGIN NOW Yes, ma'am, she said how she was very well; and to my mind she was always a very handsome young lady&mdash;and she seemed vastly contented. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Dashwood could think of no other question, and Thomas and the tablecloth, now alike needless, were soon afterwards dismissed. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne had already sent to say, that she should eat nothing more. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Dashwood's and Elinor's appetites were equally lost, and Margaret might think herself very well off, that with so much uneasiness as both her sisters had lately experienced, so much reason as they had often had to be careless of their meals, she had never been obliged to go without her dinner before. END
BEGIN NOW When the dessert and the wine were arranged, and Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor were left by themselves, they remained long together in a similarity of thoughtfulness and silence. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Dashwood feared to hazard any remark, and ventured not to offer consolation. END
BEGIN NOW She now found that she had erred in relying on Elinor's representation of herself; and justly concluded that every thing had been expressly softened at the time, to spare her from an increase of unhappiness, suffering as she then had suffered for Marianne. END
BEGIN NOW She found that she had been misled by the careful, the considerate attention of her daughter, to think the attachment, which once she had so well understood, much slighter in reality, than she had been wont to believe, or than it was now proved to be. END
BEGIN NOW She feared that under this persuasion she had been unjust, inattentive, nay, almost unkind, to her Elinor;&mdash;that Marianne's affliction, because more acknowledged, more immediately before her, had too much engrossed her tenderness, and led her away to forget that in Elinor she might have a daughter suffering almost as much, certainly with less self-provocation, and greater fortitude. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor now found the difference between the expectation of an unpleasant event, however certain the mind may be told to consider it, and certainty itself. END
BEGIN NOW She now found, that in spite of herself, she had always admitted a hope, while Edward remained single, that something would occur to prevent his marrying Lucy; that some resolution of his own, some mediation of friends, or some more eligible opportunity of establishment for the lady, would arise to assist the happiness of all. END
BEGIN NOW But he was now married; and she condemned her heart for the lurking flattery, which so much heightened the pain of the intelligence. END
BEGIN NOW That he should be married soon, before (as she imagined) he could be in orders, and consequently before he could be in possession of the living, surprised her a little at first. END
BEGIN NOW But she soon saw how likely it was that Lucy, in her self-provident care, in her haste to secure him, should overlook every thing but the risk of delay. END
BEGIN NOW They were married, married in town, and now hastening down to her uncle's. END
BEGIN NOW What had Edward felt on being within four miles from Barton, on seeing her mother's servant, on hearing Lucy's message! END
BEGIN NOW They would soon, she supposed, be settled at Delaford.&mdash;Delaford,&mdash;that place in which so much conspired to give her an interest; which she wished to be acquainted with, and yet desired to avoid. END
BEGIN NOW She saw them in an instant in their parsonage-house; saw in Lucy, the active, contriving manager, uniting at once a desire of smart appearance with the utmost frugality, and ashamed to be suspected of half her economical practices;&mdash;pursuing her own interest in every thought, courting the favour of Colonel Brandon, of Mrs. Jennings, and of every wealthy friend. END
BEGIN NOW In Edward&mdash;she knew not what she saw, nor what she wished to see;&mdash;happy or unhappy,&mdash;nothing pleased her; she turned away her head from every sketch of him. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor flattered herself that some one of their connections in London would write to them to announce the event, and give farther particulars,&mdash;but day after day passed off, and brought no letter, no tidings. END
BEGIN NOW Though uncertain that any one were to blame, she found fault with every absent friend. END
BEGIN NOW They were all thoughtless or indolent. END
BEGIN NOW When do you write to Colonel Brandon, ma'am? END
BEGIN NOW was an inquiry which sprung from the impatience of her mind to have something going on. END
BEGIN NOW I wrote to him, my love, last week, and rather expect to see, than to hear from him again. END
BEGIN NOW I earnestly pressed his coming to us, and should not be surprised to see him walk in today or tomorrow, or any day. END
BEGIN NOW This was gaining something, something to look forward to. END
BEGIN NOW Colonel Brandon must have some information to give. END
BEGIN NOW Scarcely had she so determined it, when the figure of a man on horseback drew her eyes to the window. END
BEGIN NOW He stopt at their gate. END
BEGIN NOW It was a gentleman, it was Colonel Brandon himself. END
BEGIN NOW Now she could hear more; and she trembled in expectation of it. END
BEGIN NOW But&mdash;it was NOT Colonel Brandon&mdash;neither his air&mdash;nor his height. END
BEGIN NOW Were it possible, she must say it must be Edward. END
BEGIN NOW She looked again. END
BEGIN NOW He had just dismounted;&mdash;she could not be mistaken,&mdash;it WAS Edward. END
BEGIN NOW She moved away and sat down. END
BEGIN NOW He comes from Mr. Pratt's purposely to see us. END
BEGIN NOW I WILL be calm; I WILL be mistress of myself. END
BEGIN NOW In a moment she perceived that the others were likewise aware of the mistake. END
BEGIN NOW She saw her mother and Marianne change colour; saw them look at herself, and whisper a few sentences to each other. END
BEGIN NOW She would have given the world to be able to speak&mdash;and to make them understand that she hoped no coolness, no slight, would appear in their behaviour to him;&mdash;but she had no utterance, and was obliged to leave all to their own discretion. END
BEGIN NOW Not a syllable passed aloud. END
BEGIN NOW They all waited in silence for the appearance of their visitor. END
BEGIN NOW His footsteps were heard along the gravel path; in a moment he was in the passage, and in another he was before them. END
BEGIN NOW His countenance, as he entered the room, was not too happy, even for Elinor. END
BEGIN NOW His complexion was white with agitation, and he looked as if fearful of his reception, and conscious that he merited no kind one. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Dashwood, however, conforming, as she trusted, to the wishes of that daughter, by whom she then meant in the warmth of her heart to be guided in every thing, met with a look of forced complacency, gave him her hand, and wished him joy. END
BEGIN NOW He coloured, and stammered out an unintelligible reply. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor's lips had moved with her mother's, and, when the moment of action was over, she wished that she had shaken hands with him too. END
BEGIN NOW But it was then too late, and with a countenance meaning to be open, she sat down again and talked of the weather. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne had retreated as much as possible out of sight, to conceal her distress; and Margaret, understanding some part, but not the whole of the case, thought it incumbent on her to be dignified, and therefore took a seat as far from him as she could, and maintained a strict silence. END
BEGIN NOW When Elinor had ceased to rejoice in the dryness of the season, a very awful pause took place. END
BEGIN NOW It was put an end to by Mrs. Dashwood, who felt obliged to hope that he had left Mrs. Ferrars very well. END
BEGIN NOW In a hurried manner, he replied in the affirmative. END
BEGIN NOW Another pause. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor resolving to exert herself, though fearing the sound of her own voice, now said, Is Mrs. Ferrars at Longstaple? END
BEGIN NOW At Longstaple! END
BEGIN NOW he replied, with an air of surprise.&mdash; No, my mother is in town. END
BEGIN NOW I meant, said Elinor, taking up some work from the table, to inquire for Mrs. EDWARD Ferrars. END
BEGIN NOW She dared not look up;&mdash;but her mother and Marianne both turned their eyes on him. END
BEGIN NOW He coloured, seemed perplexed, looked doubtingly, and, after some hesitation, said,&mdash; Perhaps you mean&mdash;my brother&mdash;you mean Mrs.&mdash;Mrs. ROBERT Ferrars. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Robert Ferrars! END
BEGIN NOW &mdash;was repeated by Marianne and her mother in an accent of the utmost amazement;&mdash;and though Elinor could not speak, even HER eyes were fixed on him with the same impatient wonder. END
BEGIN NOW He rose from his seat, and walked to the window, apparently from not knowing what to do; took up a pair of scissors that lay there, and while spoiling both them and their sheath by cutting the latter to pieces as he spoke, said, in a hurried voice, Perhaps you do not know&mdash;you may not have heard that my brother is lately married to&mdash;to the youngest&mdash;to Miss Lucy Steele. END
BEGIN NOW His words were echoed with unspeakable astonishment by all but Elinor, who sat with her head leaning over her work, in a state of such agitation as made her hardly know where she was. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, said he, they were married last week, and are now at Dawlish. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor could sit it no longer. END
BEGIN NOW She almost ran out of the room, and as soon as the door was closed, burst into tears of joy, which at first she thought would never cease. END
BEGIN NOW Edward, who had till then looked any where, rather than at her, saw her hurry away, and perhaps saw&mdash;or even heard, her emotion; for immediately afterwards he fell into a reverie, which no remarks, no inquiries, no affectionate address of Mrs. Dashwood could penetrate, and at last, without saying a word, quitted the room, and walked out towards the village&mdash;leaving the others in the greatest astonishment and perplexity on a change in his situation, so wonderful and so sudden;&mdash;a perplexity which they had no means of lessening but by their own conjectures. END
BEGIN NOW Unaccountable, however, as the circumstances of his release might appear to the whole family, it was certain that Edward was free; and to what purpose that freedom would be employed was easily pre-determined by all;&mdash;for after experiencing the blessings of ONE imprudent engagement, contracted without his mother's consent, as he had already done for more than four years, nothing less could be expected of him in the failure of THAT, than the immediate contraction of another. END
BEGIN NOW His errand at Barton, in fact, was a simple one. END
BEGIN NOW It was only to ask Elinor to marry him;&mdash;and considering that he was not altogether inexperienced in such a question, it might be strange that he should feel so uncomfortable in the present case as he really did, so much in need of encouragement and fresh air. END
BEGIN NOW How soon he had walked himself into the proper resolution, however, how soon an opportunity of exercising it occurred, in what manner he expressed himself, and how he was received, need not be particularly told. END
BEGIN NOW This only need be said;&mdash;that when they all sat down to table at four o'clock, about three hours after his arrival, he had secured his lady, engaged her mother's consent, and was not only in the rapturous profession of the lover, but, in the reality of reason and truth, one of the happiest of men. END
BEGIN NOW His situation indeed was more than commonly joyful. END
BEGIN NOW He had more than the ordinary triumph of accepted love to swell his heart, and raise his spirits. END
BEGIN NOW He was released without any reproach to himself, from an entanglement which had long formed his misery, from a woman whom he had long ceased to love;&mdash;and elevated at once to that security with another, which he must have thought of almost with despair, as soon as he had learnt to consider it with desire. END
BEGIN NOW He was brought, not from doubt or suspense, but from misery to happiness;&mdash;and the change was openly spoken in such a genuine, flowing, grateful cheerfulness, as his friends had never witnessed in him before. END
BEGIN NOW His heart was now open to Elinor, all its weaknesses, all its errors confessed, and his first boyish attachment to Lucy treated with all the philosophic dignity of twenty-four. END
BEGIN NOW It was a foolish, idle inclination on my side, said he, the consequence of ignorance of the world&mdash;and want of employment. END
BEGIN NOW Had my mother given me some active profession when I was removed at eighteen from the care of Mr. Pratt, I think&mdash;nay, I am sure, it would never have happened; for though I left Longstaple with what I thought, at the time, a most unconquerable preference for his niece, yet had I then had any pursuit, any object to engage my time and keep me at a distance from her for a few months, I should very soon have outgrown the fancied attachment, especially by mixing more with the world, as in such case I must have done. END
BEGIN NOW But instead of having any thing to do, instead of having any profession chosen for me, or being allowed to chuse any myself, I returned home to be completely idle; and for the first twelvemonth afterwards I had not even the nominal employment, which belonging to the university would have given me; for I was not entered at Oxford till I was nineteen. END
BEGIN NOW I had therefore nothing in the world to do, but to fancy myself in love; and as my mother did not make my home in every respect comfortable, as I had no friend, no companion in my brother, and disliked new acquaintance, it was not unnatural for me to be very often at Longstaple, where I always felt myself at home, and was always sure of a welcome; and accordingly I spent the greatest part of my time there from eighteen to nineteen: Lucy appeared everything that was amiable and obliging. END
BEGIN NOW She was pretty too&mdash;at least I thought so THEN; and I had seen so little of other women, that I could make no comparisons, and see no defects. END
BEGIN NOW Considering everything, therefore, I hope, foolish as our engagement was, foolish as it has since in every way been proved, it was not at the time an unnatural or an inexcusable piece of folly. END
BEGIN NOW The change which a few hours had wrought in the minds and the happiness of the Dashwoods, was such&mdash;so great&mdash;as promised them all, the satisfaction of a sleepless night. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Dashwood, too happy to be comfortable, knew not how to love Edward, nor praise Elinor enough, how to be enough thankful for his release without wounding his delicacy, nor how at once to give them leisure for unrestrained conversation together, and yet enjoy, as she wished, the sight and society of both. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne could speak HER happiness only by tears. END
BEGIN NOW Comparisons would occur&mdash;regrets would arise;&mdash;and her joy, though sincere as her love for her sister, was of a kind to give her neither spirits nor language. END
BEGIN NOW But Elinor&mdash;how are HER feelings to be described?&mdash;From the moment of learning that Lucy was married to another, that Edward was free, to the moment of his justifying the hopes which had so instantly followed, she was every thing by turns but tranquil. END
BEGIN NOW But when the second moment had passed, when she found every doubt, every solicitude removed, compared her situation with what so lately it had been,&mdash;saw him honourably released from his former engagement, saw him instantly profiting by the release, to address herself and declare an affection as tender, as constant as she had ever supposed it to be,&mdash;she was oppressed, she was overcome by her own felicity;&mdash;and happily disposed as is the human mind to be easily familiarized with any change for the better, it required several hours to give sedateness to her spirits, or any degree of tranquillity to her heart. END
BEGIN NOW Edward was now fixed at the cottage at least for a week;&mdash;for whatever other claims might be made on him, it was impossible that less than a week should be given up to the enjoyment of Elinor's company, or suffice to say half that was to be said of the past, the present, and the future;&mdash;for though a very few hours spent in the hard labor of incessant talking will despatch more subjects than can really be in common between any two rational creatures, yet with lovers it is different. END
BEGIN NOW Between THEM no subject is finished, no communication is even made, till it has been made at least twenty times over. END
BEGIN NOW Lucy's marriage, the unceasing and reasonable wonder among them all, formed of course one of the earliest discussions of the lovers;&mdash;and Elinor's particular knowledge of each party made it appear to her in every view, as one of the most extraordinary and unaccountable circumstances she had ever heard. END
BEGIN NOW How they could be thrown together, and by what attraction Robert could be drawn on to marry a girl, of whose beauty she had herself heard him speak without any admiration,&mdash;a girl too already engaged to his brother, and on whose account that brother had been thrown off by his family&mdash;it was beyond her comprehension to make out. END
BEGIN NOW To her own heart it was a delightful affair, to her imagination it was even a ridiculous one, but to her reason, her judgment, it was completely a puzzle. END
BEGIN NOW Edward could only attempt an explanation by supposing, that, perhaps, at first accidentally meeting, the vanity of the one had been so worked on by the flattery of the other, as to lead by degrees to all the rest. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor remembered what Robert had told her in Harley Street, of his opinion of what his own mediation in his brother's affairs might have done, if applied to in time. END
BEGIN NOW She repeated it to Edward. END
BEGIN NOW THAT was exactly like Robert, &mdash;was his immediate observation.&mdash; And THAT, he presently added, might perhaps be in HIS head when the acquaintance between them first began. END
BEGIN NOW And Lucy perhaps at first might think only of procuring his good offices in my favour. END
BEGIN NOW Other designs might afterward arise. END
BEGIN NOW How long it had been carrying on between them, however, he was equally at a loss with herself to make out; for at Oxford, where he had remained for choice ever since his quitting London, he had had no means of hearing of her but from herself, and her letters to the very last were neither less frequent, nor less affectionate than usual. END
BEGIN NOW Not the smallest suspicion, therefore, had ever occurred to prepare him for what followed;&mdash;and when at last it burst on him in a letter from Lucy herself, he had been for some time, he believed, half stupified between the wonder, the horror, and the joy of such a deliverance. END
BEGIN NOW He put the letter into Elinor's hands. END
BEGIN NOW DEAR SIR, Being very sure I have long lost your affections, I have thought myself at liberty to bestow my own on another, and have no doubt of being as happy with him as I once used to think I might be with you; but I scorn to accept a hand while the heart was another's. END
BEGIN NOW Sincerely wish you happy in your choice, and it shall not be my fault if we are not always good friends, as our near relationship now makes proper. END
BEGIN NOW I can safely say I owe you no ill-will, and am sure you will be too generous to do us any ill offices. END
BEGIN NOW Your brother has gained my affections entirely, and as we could not live without one another, we are just returned from the altar, and are now on our way to Dawlish for a few weeks, which place your dear brother has great curiosity to see, but thought I would first trouble you with these few lines, and shall always remain, Your sincere well-wisher, friend, and sister, LUCY FERRARS. END
BEGIN NOW I have burnt all your letters, and will return your picture the first opportunity. END
BEGIN NOW Please to destroy my scrawls&mdash;but the ring with my hair you are very welcome to keep. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor read and returned it without any comment. END
BEGIN NOW I will not ask your opinion of it as a composition, said Edward.&mdash; For worlds would not I have had a letter of hers seen by YOU in former days.&mdash;In a sister it is bad enough, but in a wife!&mdash;how I have blushed over the pages of her writing!&mdash;and I believe I may say that since the first half year of our foolish&mdash;business&mdash;this is the only letter I ever received from her, of which the substance made me any amends for the defect of the style. END
BEGIN NOW However it may have come about, said Elinor, after a pause,&mdash; they are certainly married. END
BEGIN NOW And your mother has brought on herself a most appropriate punishment. END
BEGIN NOW The independence she settled on Robert, through resentment against you, has put it in his power to make his own choice; and she has actually been bribing one son with a thousand a-year, to do the very deed which she disinherited the other for intending to do. END
BEGIN NOW She will hardly be less hurt, I suppose, by Robert's marrying Lucy, than she would have been by your marrying her. END
BEGIN NOW She will be more hurt by it, for Robert always was her favourite.&mdash;She will be more hurt by it, and on the same principle will forgive him much sooner. END
BEGIN NOW In what state the affair stood at present between them, Edward knew not, for no communication with any of his family had yet been attempted by him. END
BEGIN NOW He had quitted Oxford within four and twenty hours after Lucy's letter arrived, and with only one object before him, the nearest road to Barton, had had no leisure to form any scheme of conduct, with which that road did not hold the most intimate connection. END
BEGIN NOW He could do nothing till he were assured of his fate with Miss Dashwood; and by his rapidity in seeking THAT fate, it is to be supposed, in spite of the jealousy with which he had once thought of Colonel Brandon, in spite of the modesty with which he rated his own deserts, and the politeness with which he talked of his doubts, he did not, upon the whole, expect a very cruel reception. END
BEGIN NOW It was his business, however, to say that he DID, and he said it very prettily. END
BEGIN NOW What he might say on the subject a twelvemonth after, must be referred to the imagination of husbands and wives. END
BEGIN NOW That Lucy had certainly meant to deceive, to go off with a flourish of malice against him in her message by Thomas, was perfectly clear to Elinor; and Edward himself, now thoroughly enlightened on her character, had no scruple in believing her capable of the utmost meanness of wanton ill-nature. END
BEGIN NOW Though his eyes had been long opened, even before his acquaintance with Elinor began, to her ignorance and a want of liberality in some of her opinions&mdash;they had been equally imputed, by him, to her want of education; and till her last letter reached him, he had always believed her to be a well-disposed, good-hearted girl, and thoroughly attached to himself. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing but such a persuasion could have prevented his putting an end to an engagement, which, long before the discovery of it laid him open to his mother's anger, had been a continual source of disquiet and regret to him. END
BEGIN NOW I thought it my duty, said he, independent of my feelings, to give her the option of continuing the engagement or not, when I was renounced by my mother, and stood to all appearance without a friend in the world to assist me. END
BEGIN NOW In such a situation as that, where there seemed nothing to tempt the avarice or the vanity of any living creature, how could I suppose, when she so earnestly, so warmly insisted on sharing my fate, whatever it might be, that any thing but the most disinterested affection was her inducement? END
BEGIN NOW And even now, I cannot comprehend on what motive she acted, or what fancied advantage it could be to her, to be fettered to a man for whom she had not the smallest regard, and who had only two thousand pounds in the world. END
BEGIN NOW She could not foresee that Colonel Brandon would give me a living. END
BEGIN NOW No; but she might suppose that something would occur in your favour; that your own family might in time relent. END
BEGIN NOW And at any rate, she lost nothing by continuing the engagement, for she has proved that it fettered neither her inclination nor her actions. END
BEGIN NOW The connection was certainly a respectable one, and probably gained her consideration among her friends; and, if nothing more advantageous occurred, it would be better for her to marry YOU than be single. END
BEGIN NOW Edward was, of course, immediately convinced that nothing could have been more natural than Lucy's conduct, nor more self-evident than the motive of it. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor scolded him, harshly as ladies always scold the imprudence which compliments themselves, for having spent so much time with them at Norland, when he must have felt his own inconstancy. END
BEGIN NOW Your behaviour was certainly very wrong, said she; because&mdash;to say nothing of my own conviction, our relations were all led away by it to fancy and expect WHAT, as you were THEN situated, could never be. END
BEGIN NOW He could only plead an ignorance of his own heart, and a mistaken confidence in the force of his engagement. END
BEGIN NOW I was simple enough to think, that because my FAITH was plighted to another, there could be no danger in my being with you; and that the consciousness of my engagement was to keep my heart as safe and sacred as my honour. END
BEGIN NOW I felt that I admired you, but I told myself it was only friendship; and till I began to make comparisons between yourself and Lucy, I did not know how far I was got. END
BEGIN NOW After that, I suppose, I WAS wrong in remaining so much in Sussex, and the arguments with which I reconciled myself to the expediency of it, were no better than these:&mdash;The danger is my own; I am doing no injury to anybody but myself. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor smiled, and shook her head. END
BEGIN NOW Edward heard with pleasure of Colonel Brandon's being expected at the Cottage, as he really wished not only to be better acquainted with him, but to have an opportunity of convincing him that he no longer resented his giving him the living of Delaford&mdash; Which, at present, said he, after thanks so ungraciously delivered as mine were on the occasion, he must think I have never forgiven him for offering. END
BEGIN NOW NOW he felt astonished himself that he had never yet been to the place. END
BEGIN NOW But so little interest had he taken in the matter, that he owed all his knowledge of the house, garden, and glebe, extent of the parish, condition of the land, and rate of the tithes, to Elinor herself, who had heard so much of it from Colonel Brandon, and heard it with so much attention, as to be entirely mistress of the subject. END
BEGIN NOW One question after this only remained undecided, between them, one difficulty only was to be overcome. END
BEGIN NOW They were brought together by mutual affection, with the warmest approbation of their real friends; their intimate knowledge of each other seemed to make their happiness certain&mdash;and they only wanted something to live upon. END
BEGIN NOW Edward had two thousand pounds, and Elinor one, which, with Delaford living, was all that they could call their own; for it was impossible that Mrs. Dashwood should advance anything; and they were neither of them quite enough in love to think that three hundred and fifty pounds a-year would supply them with the comforts of life. END
BEGIN NOW Edward was not entirely without hopes of some favourable change in his mother towards him; and on THAT he rested for the residue of their income. END
BEGIN NOW But Elinor had no such dependence; for since Edward would still be unable to marry Miss Morton, and his chusing herself had been spoken of in Mrs. Ferrars's flattering language as only a lesser evil than his chusing Lucy Steele, she feared that Robert's offence would serve no other purpose than to enrich Fanny. END
BEGIN NOW About four days after Edward's arrival Colonel Brandon appeared, to complete Mrs. Dashwood's satisfaction, and to give her the dignity of having, for the first time since her living at Barton, more company with her than her house would hold. END
BEGIN NOW Edward was allowed to retain the privilege of first comer, and Colonel Brandon therefore walked every night to his old quarters at the Park; from whence he usually returned in the morning, early enough to interrupt the lovers' first tete-a-tete before breakfast. END
BEGIN NOW A three weeks' residence at Delaford, where, in his evening hours at least, he had little to do but to calculate the disproportion between thirty-six and seventeen, brought him to Barton in a temper of mind which needed all the improvement in Marianne's looks, all the kindness of her welcome, and all the encouragement of her mother's language, to make it cheerful. END
BEGIN NOW Among such friends, however, and such flattery, he did revive. END
BEGIN NOW No rumour of Lucy's marriage had yet reached him:&mdash;he knew nothing of what had passed; and the first hours of his visit were consequently spent in hearing and in wondering. END
BEGIN NOW Every thing was explained to him by Mrs. Dashwood, and he found fresh reason to rejoice in what he had done for Mr. Ferrars, since eventually it promoted the interest of Elinor. END
BEGIN NOW It would be needless to say, that the gentlemen advanced in the good opinion of each other, as they advanced in each other's acquaintance, for it could not be otherwise. END
BEGIN NOW Their resemblance in good principles and good sense, in disposition and manner of thinking, would probably have been sufficient to unite them in friendship, without any other attraction; but their being in love with two sisters, and two sisters fond of each other, made that mutual regard inevitable and immediate, which might otherwise have waited the effect of time and judgment. END
BEGIN NOW The letters from town, which a few days before would have made every nerve in Elinor's body thrill with transport, now arrived to be read with less emotion than mirth. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Jennings wrote to tell the wonderful tale, to vent her honest indignation against the jilting girl, and pour forth her compassion towards poor Mr. Edward, who, she was sure, had quite doted upon the worthless hussy, and was now, by all accounts, almost broken-hearted, at Oxford.&mdash; I do think, she continued, nothing was ever carried on so sly; for it was but two days before Lucy called and sat a couple of hours with me. END
BEGIN NOW Not a soul suspected anything of the matter, not even Nancy, who, poor soul! END
BEGIN NOW came crying to me the day after, in a great fright for fear of Mrs. Ferrars, as well as not knowing how to get to Plymouth; for Lucy it seems borrowed all her money before she went off to be married, on purpose we suppose to make a show with, and poor Nancy had not seven shillings in the world;&mdash;so I was very glad to give her five guineas to take her down to Exeter, where she thinks of staying three or four weeks with Mrs. Burgess, in hopes, as I tell her, to fall in with the Doctor again. END
BEGIN NOW And I must say that Lucy's crossness not to take them along with them in the chaise is worse than all. END
BEGIN NOW Poor Mr. Edward! END
BEGIN NOW I cannot get him out of my head, but you must send for him to Barton, and Miss Marianne must try to comfort him. END
BEGIN NOW Mr. Dashwood's strains were more solemn. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Ferrars was the most unfortunate of women&mdash;poor Fanny had suffered agonies of sensibility&mdash;and he considered the existence of each, under such a blow, with grateful wonder. END
BEGIN NOW Robert's offence was unpardonable, but Lucy's was infinitely worse. END
BEGIN NOW Neither of them were ever again to be mentioned to Mrs. Ferrars; and even, if she might hereafter be induced to forgive her son, his wife should never be acknowledged as her daughter, nor be permitted to appear in her presence. END
BEGIN NOW The secrecy with which everything had been carried on between them, was rationally treated as enormously heightening the crime, because, had any suspicion of it occurred to the others, proper measures would have been taken to prevent the marriage; and he called on Elinor to join with him in regretting that Lucy's engagement with Edward had not rather been fulfilled, than that she should thus be the means of spreading misery farther in the family.&mdash; He thus continued: Mrs. Ferrars has never yet mentioned Edward's name, which does not surprise us; but, to our great astonishment, not a line has been received from him on the occasion. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps, however, he is kept silent by his fear of offending, and I shall, therefore, give him a hint, by a line to Oxford, that his sister and I both think a letter of proper submission from him, addressed perhaps to Fanny, and by her shewn to her mother, might not be taken amiss; for we all know the tenderness of Mrs. Ferrars's heart, and that she wishes for nothing so much as to be on good terms with her children. END
BEGIN NOW This paragraph was of some importance to the prospects and conduct of Edward. END
BEGIN NOW It determined him to attempt a reconciliation, though not exactly in the manner pointed out by their brother and sister. END
BEGIN NOW A letter of proper submission! END
BEGIN NOW repeated he; would they have me beg my mother's pardon for Robert's ingratitude to HER, and breach of honour to ME?&mdash;I can make no submission&mdash;I am grown neither humble nor penitent by what has passed.&mdash;I am grown very happy; but that would not interest.&mdash;I know of no submission that IS proper for me to make. END
BEGIN NOW You may certainly ask to be forgiven, said Elinor, because you have offended;&mdash;and I should think you might NOW venture so far as to profess some concern for having ever formed the engagement which drew on you your mother's anger. END
BEGIN NOW He agreed that he might. END
BEGIN NOW And when she has forgiven you, perhaps a little humility may be convenient while acknowledging a second engagement, almost as imprudent in HER eyes as the first. END
BEGIN NOW He had nothing to urge against it, but still resisted the idea of a letter of proper submission; and therefore, to make it easier to him, as he declared a much greater willingness to make mean concessions by word of mouth than on paper, it was resolved that, instead of writing to Fanny, he should go to London, and personally intreat her good offices in his favour.&mdash; And if they really DO interest themselves, said Marianne, in her new character of candour, in bringing about a reconciliation, I shall think that even John and Fanny are not entirely without merit. END
BEGIN NOW After a visit on Colonel Brandon's side of only three or four days, the two gentlemen quitted Barton together.&mdash; They were to go immediately to Delaford, that Edward might have some personal knowledge of his future home, and assist his patron and friend in deciding on what improvements were needed to it; and from thence, after staying there a couple of nights, he was to proceed on his journey to town. END
BEGIN NOW After a proper resistance on the part of Mrs. Ferrars, just so violent and so steady as to preserve her from that reproach which she always seemed fearful of incurring, the reproach of being too amiable, Edward was admitted to her presence, and pronounced to be again her son. END
BEGIN NOW Her family had of late been exceedingly fluctuating. END
BEGIN NOW For many years of her life she had had two sons; but the crime and annihilation of Edward a few weeks ago, had robbed her of one; the similar annihilation of Robert had left her for a fortnight without any; and now, by the resuscitation of Edward, she had one again. END
BEGIN NOW In spite of his being allowed once more to live, however, he did not feel the continuance of his existence secure, till he had revealed his present engagement; for the publication of that circumstance, he feared, might give a sudden turn to his constitution, and carry him off as rapidly as before. END
BEGIN NOW With apprehensive caution therefore it was revealed, and he was listened to with unexpected calmness. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Ferrars at first reasonably endeavoured to dissuade him from marrying Miss Dashwood, by every argument in her power;&mdash;told him, that in Miss Morton he would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune;&mdash;and enforced the assertion, by observing that Miss Morton was the daughter of a nobleman with thirty thousand pounds, while Miss Dashwood was only the daughter of a private gentleman with no more than THREE; but when she found that, though perfectly admitting the truth of her representation, he was by no means inclined to be guided by it, she judged it wisest, from the experience of the past, to submit&mdash;and therefore, after such an ungracious delay as she owed to her own dignity, and as served to prevent every suspicion of good-will, she issued her decree of consent to the marriage of Edward and Elinor. END
BEGIN NOW What she would engage to do towards augmenting their income was next to be considered; and here it plainly appeared, that though Edward was now her only son, he was by no means her eldest; for while Robert was inevitably endowed with a thousand pounds a-year, not the smallest objection was made against Edward's taking orders for the sake of two hundred and fifty at the utmost; nor was anything promised either for the present or in future, beyond the ten thousand pounds, which had been given with Fanny. END
BEGIN NOW It was as much, however, as was desired, and more than was expected, by Edward and Elinor; and Mrs. Ferrars herself, by her shuffling excuses, seemed the only person surprised at her not giving more. END
BEGIN NOW With an income quite sufficient to their wants thus secured to them, they had nothing to wait for after Edward was in possession of the living, but the readiness of the house, to which Colonel Brandon, with an eager desire for the accommodation of Elinor, was making considerable improvements; and after waiting some time for their completion, after experiencing, as usual, a thousand disappointments and delays from the unaccountable dilatoriness of the workmen, Elinor, as usual, broke through the first positive resolution of not marrying till every thing was ready, and the ceremony took place in Barton church early in the autumn. END
BEGIN NOW The first month after their marriage was spent with their friend at the Mansion-house; from whence they could superintend the progress of the Parsonage, and direct every thing as they liked on the spot;&mdash;could chuse papers, project shrubberies, and invent a sweep. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Jennings's prophecies, though rather jumbled together, were chiefly fulfilled; for she was able to visit Edward and his wife in their Parsonage by Michaelmas, and she found in Elinor and her husband, as she really believed, one of the happiest couples in the world. END
BEGIN NOW They had in fact nothing to wish for, but the marriage of Colonel Brandon and Marianne, and rather better pasturage for their cows. END
BEGIN NOW They were visited on their first settling by almost all their relations and friends. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Ferrars came to inspect the happiness which she was almost ashamed of having authorised; and even the Dashwoods were at the expense of a journey from Sussex to do them honour. END
BEGIN NOW I will not say that I am disappointed, my dear sister, said John, as they were walking together one morning before the gates of Delaford House, THAT would be saying too much, for certainly you have been one of the most fortunate young women in the world, as it is. END
BEGIN NOW But, I confess, it would give me great pleasure to call Colonel Brandon brother. END
BEGIN NOW His property here, his place, his house, every thing is in such respectable and excellent condition!&mdash;and his woods!&mdash;I have not seen such timber any where in Dorsetshire, as there is now standing in Delaford Hanger!&mdash;And though, perhaps, Marianne may not seem exactly the person to attract him&mdash;yet I think it would altogether be advisable for you to have them now frequently staying with you, for as Colonel Brandon seems a great deal at home, nobody can tell what may happen&mdash;for, when people are much thrown together, and see little of anybody else&mdash;and it will always be in your power to set her off to advantage, and so forth;&mdash;in short, you may as well give her a chance&mdash;You understand me. END
BEGIN NOW &mdash; But though Mrs. Ferrars DID come to see them, and always treated them with the make-believe of decent affection, they were never insulted by her real favour and preference. END
BEGIN NOW THAT was due to the folly of Robert, and the cunning of his wife; and it was earned by them before many months had passed away. END
BEGIN NOW The selfish sagacity of the latter, which had at first drawn Robert into the scrape, was the principal instrument of his deliverance from it; for her respectful humility, assiduous attentions, and endless flatteries, as soon as the smallest opening was given for their exercise, reconciled Mrs. Ferrars to his choice, and re-established him completely in her favour. END
BEGIN NOW The whole of Lucy's behaviour in the affair, and the prosperity which crowned it, therefore, may be held forth as a most encouraging instance of what an earnest, an unceasing attention to self-interest, however its progress may be apparently obstructed, will do in securing every advantage of fortune, with no other sacrifice than that of time and conscience. END
BEGIN NOW When Robert first sought her acquaintance, and privately visited her in Bartlett's Buildings, it was only with the view imputed to him by his brother. END
BEGIN NOW He merely meant to persuade her to give up the engagement; and as there could be nothing to overcome but the affection of both, he naturally expected that one or two interviews would settle the matter. END
BEGIN NOW In that point, however, and that only, he erred;&mdash;for though Lucy soon gave him hopes that his eloquence would convince her in TIME, another visit, another conversation, was always wanted to produce this conviction. END
BEGIN NOW Some doubts always lingered in her mind when they parted, which could only be removed by another half hour's discourse with himself. END
BEGIN NOW His attendance was by this means secured, and the rest followed in course. END
BEGIN NOW Instead of talking of Edward, they came gradually to talk only of Robert,&mdash;a subject on which he had always more to say than on any other, and in which she soon betrayed an interest even equal to his own; and in short, it became speedily evident to both, that he had entirely supplanted his brother. END
BEGIN NOW He was proud of his conquest, proud of tricking Edward, and very proud of marrying privately without his mother's consent. END
BEGIN NOW What immediately followed is known. END
BEGIN NOW They passed some months in great happiness at Dawlish; for she had many relations and old acquaintances to cut&mdash;and he drew several plans for magnificent cottages;&mdash;and from thence returning to town, procured the forgiveness of Mrs. Ferrars, by the simple expedient of asking it, which, at Lucy's instigation, was adopted. END
BEGIN NOW The forgiveness, at first, indeed, as was reasonable, comprehended only Robert; and Lucy, who had owed his mother no duty and therefore could have transgressed none, still remained some weeks longer unpardoned. END
BEGIN NOW But perseverance in humility of conduct and messages, in self-condemnation for Robert's offence, and gratitude for the unkindness she was treated with, procured her in time the haughty notice which overcame her by its graciousness, and led soon afterwards, by rapid degrees, to the highest state of affection and influence. END
BEGIN NOW Lucy became as necessary to Mrs. Ferrars, as either Robert or Fanny; and while Edward was never cordially forgiven for having once intended to marry her, and Elinor, though superior to her in fortune and birth, was spoken of as an intruder, SHE was in every thing considered, and always openly acknowledged, to be a favourite child. END
BEGIN NOW They settled in town, received very liberal assistance from Mrs. Ferrars, were on the best terms imaginable with the Dashwoods; and setting aside the jealousies and ill-will continually subsisting between Fanny and Lucy, in which their husbands of course took a part, as well as the frequent domestic disagreements between Robert and Lucy themselves, nothing could exceed the harmony in which they all lived together. END
BEGIN NOW What Edward had done to forfeit the right of eldest son, might have puzzled many people to find out; and what Robert had done to succeed to it, might have puzzled them still more. END
BEGIN NOW It was an arrangement, however, justified in its effects, if not in its cause; for nothing ever appeared in Robert's style of living or of talking to give a suspicion of his regretting the extent of his income, as either leaving his brother too little, or bringing himself too much;&mdash;and if Edward might be judged from the ready discharge of his duties in every particular, from an increasing attachment to his wife and his home, and from the regular cheerfulness of his spirits, he might be supposed no less contented with his lot, no less free from every wish of an exchange. END
BEGIN NOW Elinor's marriage divided her as little from her family as could well be contrived, without rendering the cottage at Barton entirely useless, for her mother and sisters spent much more than half their time with her. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Dashwood was acting on motives of policy as well as pleasure in the frequency of her visits at Delaford; for her wish of bringing Marianne and Colonel Brandon together was hardly less earnest, though rather more liberal than what John had expressed. END
BEGIN NOW It was now her darling object. END
BEGIN NOW Precious as was the company of her daughter to her, she desired nothing so much as to give up its constant enjoyment to her valued friend; and to see Marianne settled at the mansion-house was equally the wish of Edward and Elinor. END
BEGIN NOW They each felt his sorrows, and their own obligations, and Marianne, by general consent, was to be the reward of all. END
BEGIN NOW With such a confederacy against her&mdash;with a knowledge so intimate of his goodness&mdash;with a conviction of his fond attachment to herself, which at last, though long after it was observable to everybody else&mdash;burst on her&mdash;what could she do? END
BEGIN NOW Marianne Dashwood was born to an extraordinary fate. END
BEGIN NOW She was born to discover the falsehood of her own opinions, and to counteract, by her conduct, her most favourite maxims. END
BEGIN NOW She was born to overcome an affection formed so late in life as at seventeen, and with no sentiment superior to strong esteem and lively friendship, voluntarily to give her hand to another!&mdash;and THAT other, a man who had suffered no less than herself under the event of a former attachment, whom, two years before, she had considered too old to be married,&mdash;and who still sought the constitutional safeguard of a flannel waistcoat! END
BEGIN NOW But so it was. END
BEGIN NOW Instead of falling a sacrifice to an irresistible passion, as once she had fondly flattered herself with expecting,&mdash;instead of remaining even for ever with her mother, and finding her only pleasures in retirement and study, as afterwards in her more calm and sober judgment she had determined on,&mdash;she found herself at nineteen, submitting to new attachments, entering on new duties, placed in a new home, a wife, the mistress of a family, and the patroness of a village. END
BEGIN NOW Colonel Brandon was now as happy, as all those who best loved him, believed he deserved to be;&mdash;in Marianne he was consoled for every past affliction;&mdash;her regard and her society restored his mind to animation, and his spirits to cheerfulness; and that Marianne found her own happiness in forming his, was equally the persuasion and delight of each observing friend. END
BEGIN NOW Marianne could never love by halves; and her whole heart became, in time, as much devoted to her husband, as it had once been to Willoughby. END
BEGIN NOW Willoughby could not hear of her marriage without a pang; and his punishment was soon afterwards complete in the voluntary forgiveness of Mrs. Smith, who, by stating his marriage with a woman of character, as the source of her clemency, gave him reason for believing that had he behaved with honour towards Marianne, he might at once have been happy and rich. END
BEGIN NOW That his repentance of misconduct, which thus brought its own punishment, was sincere, need not be doubted;&mdash;nor that he long thought of Colonel Brandon with envy, and of Marianne with regret. END
BEGIN NOW But that he was for ever inconsolable, that he fled from society, or contracted an habitual gloom of temper, or died of a broken heart, must not be depended on&mdash;for he did neither. END
BEGIN NOW He lived to exert, and frequently to enjoy himself. END
BEGIN NOW His wife was not always out of humour, nor his home always uncomfortable; and in his breed of horses and dogs, and in sporting of every kind, he found no inconsiderable degree of domestic felicity. END
BEGIN NOW For Marianne, however&mdash;in spite of his incivility in surviving her loss&mdash;he always retained that decided regard which interested him in every thing that befell her, and made her his secret standard of perfection in woman;&mdash;and many a rising beauty would be slighted by him in after-days as bearing no comparison with Mrs. Brandon. END
BEGIN NOW Mrs. Dashwood was prudent enough to remain at the cottage, without attempting a removal to Delaford; and fortunately for Sir John and Mrs. Jennings, when Marianne was taken from them, Margaret had reached an age highly suitable for dancing, and not very ineligible for being supposed to have a lover. END
BEGIN NOW Between Barton and Delaford, there was that constant communication which strong family affection would naturally dictate;&mdash;and among the merits and the happiness of Elinor and Marianne, let it not be ranked as the least considerable, that though sisters, and living almost within sight of each other, they could live without disagreement between themselves, or producing coolness between their husbands.  END
BEGIN NOW Once upon a time (Do you see the town's circled walls, in black watercolor on sepia?) END
BEGIN NOW there was a king who had three daughters. END
BEGIN NOW (A man's desk, covered in papers. END
BEGIN NOW A man's shadow over the desk. END
BEGIN NOW Three smaller shadows beyond him.) END
BEGIN NOW He wished to know which daughter loved him best. END
BEGIN NOW (Oh, do you see? END
BEGIN NOW The shadows are puppets. END
BEGIN NOW Look how they move their arms at the joints.) END
BEGIN NOW To her he would give his whole kingdom. END
BEGIN NOW (The town again, its clock tower looming above the walls.) END
BEGIN NOW The eldest daughter said, I love you more than my life. END
BEGIN NOW (One puppet spins in a pirouette.) END
BEGIN NOW The second daughter said, I love you more than the sun and all the stars. END
BEGIN NOW (Another puppet leaps into the air.) END
BEGIN NOW But the third daughter said, I love you as meat loves salt. END
BEGIN NOW (The last puppet stands still.) END
BEGIN NOW Now, the king was very angry at his youngest daughter. END
BEGIN NOW But which of the daughters really deserved the kingdom? END
BEGIN NOW — Princess Tutu, The Chapter of the Egg: The Duke's Daughters. END
BEGIN NOW Overture, King Lear, M. Balakirev. END
BEGIN NOW — Let us have a tragedy today, declared the Man Without Hands. END
BEGIN NOW An old one. END
BEGIN NOW I'll make it new again. END
BEGIN NOW Set it on a winter's night, the coldest night of the year. END
BEGIN NOW It will be an excellent story, don't you think? END
BEGIN NOW Twelve marionettes rose to their feet obediently and pulled at the cranks of the great machine. END
BEGIN NOW Far above them, up in the town, clouds slid into the sky, and a chill wind dropped the last leaves from the trees. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, yes, said the Man Without Hands. END
BEGIN NOW There will be snow tonight. END
BEGIN NOW And you, he said, gesturing with his gloved arms at the thirteenth marionette, you know what you are doing, don't you, hmmm? END
BEGIN NOW The thirteenth marionette lifted a box and opened it. END
BEGIN NOW She arranged a set of jewels in neat rows inside the box. END
BEGIN NOW She closed the box, set it aside, and tested the tuning of her barrel organ. END
BEGIN NOW It was in perfect tune. END
BEGIN NOW (It was always in perfect tune.) END
BEGIN NOW Then the thirteenth marionette took the box and the barrel organ, stepped onto a slowly-spinning gear, and let it wheel her up through the machine and out, through a hidden doorway, into the town. END
BEGIN NOW The Man Without Hands waved his right arm as if it were a baton. END
BEGIN NOW Now then, music! END
BEGIN NOW Timpani and horns, there, and the violins, there, yes. END
BEGIN NOW Very good. END
BEGIN NOW The clockwork orchestra whirred and began to play. END
BEGIN NOW — The thirteenth marionette, whose name was Edel, wheeled up into the town and listened to all of its sounds. END
BEGIN NOW She was part of the great machine, after all, and so was the town. END
BEGIN NOW Edel heard the beginning ballet students chattering: A performance at the Duke's castle! END
BEGIN NOW Isn't it exciting? END
BEGIN NOW Lilie rested her right foot on the barre and stretched over her leg. END
BEGIN NOW Her friend Pique stretched as well, and slowly slid into a split. END
BEGIN NOW Only the advanced class will be dancing. END
BEGIN NOW I wish we were allowed to perform. END
BEGIN NOW Yes! END
BEGIN NOW Lilie's grin was more than a little alarming. END
BEGIN NOW Then our little Duck could dance too, and she would probably fall down in front of the Duke himself! END
BEGIN NOW I would not, answered the third girl in the beginner class, who was gamely, if inelegantly, attempting a straddle stretch routine. END
BEGIN NOW Edel knew her, of course; she was the Duck. END
BEGIN NOW I didn't even know we had a Duke. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, Duck, laughed Lilie, You don't know anything, do you? END
BEGIN NOW Edel glided past the windows of the salle. END
BEGIN NOW The Duck cried out, and lost her balance, but Edel thought that no one else had seen her pass by. END
BEGIN NOW From the west window, Edel saw the advanced ballet class practicing its routine for the performance: Yes, yes, Miss Rue, the Cat was saying to the Raven Princess, support your arm just like that and hold it. END
BEGIN NOW Do you see her perfect form, ladies? END
BEGIN NOW Imitate it. END
BEGIN NOW Now, Mytho and Fakir, remember that you are the Clock, and your only duty is to tell the time. END
BEGIN NOW Don't look sour, Fakir, look like a clock. END
BEGIN NOW Edel watched the Prince and the Knight move, the two arms of a great invisible clock. END
BEGIN NOW She watched the Raven Princess lead the other dancers around them. END
BEGIN NOW She watched them step and spin and stretch, a corps of marionettes, dancing as the puppetmaster commanded them. END
BEGIN NOW — Oh, it's a fine stage, the Duke's castle, the Man Without Hands had said. END
BEGIN NOW It will be a pleasure to use it properly. END
BEGIN NOW Edel came inside through the servants' door, when the butler and housekeeper weren't looking. END
BEGIN NOW She passed through the kitchen, up the back staircase, and into the ballroom without difficulty. END
BEGIN NOW Edel knew all the houses in Gold Crown Town, after all, and had no need to ask for directions. END
BEGIN NOW In the ballroom, she found an empty niche between two statues, and stood still, one more statue ornamenting the Duke's household. END
BEGIN NOW Edel saw the two elder daughters as they entered the ballroom: two tall rats in silk gowns, snarling and biting at each other's tails. END
BEGIN NOW But when the troupe of young dancers came in to take their places, with the rest of the audience behind them, the daughters stopped squabbling. END
BEGIN NOW They smiled bland smiles through their teeth. END
BEGIN NOW The old Duke, a gold circlet on his wrinkled head and thin white whiskers on his snout, settled in the seat of honor, with his youngest daughter on his left. END
BEGIN NOW The Cat and the beginner and intermediate ballet classes seated themselves on the floor, along with a dozen party guests from elsewhere in the town. END
BEGIN NOW Tonight, announced the Duke, is a special night. END
BEGIN NOW Tonight I choose which of my daughters will inherit my castle! END
BEGIN NOW The party guests murmured in excitement. END
BEGIN NOW (The Duck was whispering, Did you know they were rats? ) END
BEGIN NOW But before I make my decision, I have brought us an exciting treat. END
BEGIN NOW I have commissioned a small dance from Gold Crown Town's own brilliant Mr. Cat, Director of the Gold Crown Academy Ballet School, to be performed by his best students. END
BEGIN NOW The Cat stood and bowed, smiling with his mouth closed so as not to alarm his patron, the rat Duke. END
BEGIN NOW We are honored to serve you, sir, the Cat answered. END
BEGIN NOW May I present the Waltz of the Hours from Coppélia? END
BEGIN NOW Twelve danseuses danced in four precise lines (assemblé, balancé, changement), with the Raven Princess at the head of the first line.Two danseurs stood behind them, mimicking the clock as it struck: first position arms, third, tendue, and repeat. END
BEGIN NOW Edel knew the dance well. END
BEGIN NOW It was the dance of the great tower clock. END
BEGIN NOW The Prince and the Knight showed the time, while the twelve members of the corps were the automata running the clock, the gears and the pulleys that caused the hours to strike. END
BEGIN NOW In the great machine of Gold Crown Town, Edel's twelve sisters were doing the same work, stepping the same steps, as the dancers in the Duke's ballroom. END
BEGIN NOW The Duke applauded the performance politely. END
BEGIN NOW His daughters, and the other guests, clapped along with him. END
BEGIN NOW Among the ballet students, the Duck cheered wildly while her friends attempted to quiet her. END
BEGIN NOW The dancers curtsied or bowed and joined the audience. END
BEGIN NOW Then the Duke stood again. END
BEGIN NOW He was taller than Edel, and his paws trembled with age, but he was a dignified old rat. END
BEGIN NOW My thanks to Mr. Cat and the Ballet School. END
BEGIN NOW Daughters, will you come up and join me? END
BEGIN NOW The three daughters, in their three silk gowns with their tails sticking out from the backs, came to stand beside the As you all know, continued the Duke, I am very old now, and I am ready to give my castle away to one of my daughters. END
BEGIN NOW But to win the castle, my daughters must each answer one question. END
BEGIN NOW The Duke had been speaking quietly, but now his voice rang out through the hall, and he shook his white whiskers at the crowd. END
BEGIN NOW Tell me now: how much do each of you love me? END
BEGIN NOW (In the audience, the Raven Princess flinched and covered the flinch with a smile.) END
BEGIN NOW The Duke's eldest daughter smiled a toothy smile. END
BEGIN NOW How much do I love you? END
BEGIN NOW I love you as much as my very own life. END
BEGIN NOW I love you more than my dreams and more than my wishes. END
BEGIN NOW The Duke, satisfied, pointed to his second daughter. END
BEGIN NOW Now, you. END
BEGIN NOW The Duke's second daughter smiled an even toothier smile. END
BEGIN NOW How much do I love you? END
BEGIN NOW Just as much as my sister does, if not more. END
BEGIN NOW I love you like the sun in the morning. END
BEGIN NOW I love you like the moon at night. END
BEGIN NOW I love you as much as anyone has ever loved another person. END
BEGIN NOW Very good. END
BEGIN NOW Now, Rattelia, how much do you love me? END
BEGIN NOW But the Duke's third daughter was not smiling. END
BEGIN NOW She said, What do you want me to tell you? END
BEGIN NOW I love you as much as you deserve. END
BEGIN NOW That's all. END
BEGIN NOW No more. END
BEGIN NOW Do you want me to make silly comparisons like my sisters did? END
BEGIN NOW Should I tell you that I love you like the gates of Gold Crown Town, the ones that never open to let anyone out? END
BEGIN NOW Be silent! END
BEGIN NOW snapped the Duke. END
BEGIN NOW You are a heartless child and unworthy of the gift you are asking for! END
BEGIN NOW The party guests were staring at the Duke and his youngest daughter, so of course no one was watching Edel. END
BEGIN NOW In her niche by the wall, Edel opened her jewelry box and touched a ruby. END
BEGIN NOW It glowed red. END
BEGIN NOW A moment later, so did the Duck's pendant. END
BEGIN NOW A heartshard! END
BEGIN NOW whispered the Duck. END
BEGIN NOW Louder, to her friends, she said, I have to—er, I have to—I have to find the bathroom, yeah, that's right, the bathroom. END
BEGIN NOW The Duck ran past Edel and out of the room, managing not to trip over her own feet. END
BEGIN NOW Thirty seconds later, Princess Tutu danced into the room, serene and perfect, bringing a wind of pink flower petals along with her. END
BEGIN NOW Edel adjusted her vision for a moment, so she could see what the guests were seeing: a great white swan, flying in through an open window. END
BEGIN NOW The guests whispered to each other: how strange, a swan in a ballroom. END
BEGIN NOW Rattelia, said Tutu, reaching out her right hand in invitation, come dance with me. END
BEGIN NOW Obedient, if confused, Rattelia took Tutu's hand in her paw and stepped into a pas-de-deux. END
BEGIN NOW You told your father, Tutu said gently, that you only loved him as much as he deserved. END
BEGIN NOW But look how unhappy he is. END
BEGIN NOW Tell me, Rattelia, Tutu continued, leading Rattelia into a turn, is that how you really feel? END
BEGIN NOW Rattelia stopped still and pulled herself out of the dance. END
BEGIN NOW Yes! END
BEGIN NOW Yes, that is exactly how I really feel. END
BEGIN NOW Leave me alone! END
BEGIN NOW Tutu stopped mid-step, confused. END
BEGIN NOW She danced into the niche behind the nearest statue, and a moment later she was a small girl. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, hello, Miss Edel, said the Duck to the statue. END
BEGIN NOW Hello, Duck, replied Edel. END
BEGIN NOW Miss Edel, what did I do wrong? END
BEGIN NOW There's a heartshard here, I know it, and I thought Rattelia had it, but she doesn't, and I don't know what to do! END
BEGIN NOW The Duck wrapped her arms around Edel's wooden body. END
BEGIN NOW It felt strange, and Edel wondered what it meant. END
BEGIN NOW But Edel had an assignment, and right now, her assignment was to distract the Duck. END
BEGIN NOW The truth of the heart is a mystery, known only to the possessor. END
BEGIN NOW And sometimes, not even then, Edel answered. END
BEGIN NOW (In the ballroom beyond them, the Duke was saying, I give my castle wholly to my two elder daughters. END
BEGIN NOW You, Rattelia, must go now! END
BEGIN NOW Now! ) END
BEGIN NOW So— the Duck struggled with Edel's answer, so maybe she does have a heartshard—and she doesn't know it? END
BEGIN NOW (Rattelia turned and stamped out of the room. END
BEGIN NOW It's such a shame she had to go, said the Eldest Daughter.) END
BEGIN NOW Edel said, Everyone lives in a maze, and the maze has only one path. END
BEGIN NOW ( So the castle is ours now, dear? END
BEGIN NOW said the Second Daughter to the Eldest Daughter. END
BEGIN NOW How nice. END
BEGIN NOW They smiled their toothy smiles at the guests. END
BEGIN NOW We'd like to thank you all for coming, but it's time for you to go home now. ) END
BEGIN NOW But if there's only one path, said the Duck, why does it matter if it's a maze? END
BEGIN NOW Couldn't you just walk all the way out? END
BEGIN NOW (The ballet students and the party guests left the ballroom in small groups, muttering to each other about how rude their hosts were, until at last no one remained but the Eldest Daughter, the Second Daughter, the Duke, the Duck and the the statues.) END
BEGIN NOW The path is long, answered Edel, and there are many turns before you reach the end. END
BEGIN NOW (Down in the gears and pulleys of the machine, the Man Without Hands laughed, And the end will be tragic. ) END
BEGIN NOW The Duck poked her head out from behind Edel to see what was going on in the ballroom, just as the Eldest Daughter said to the Duke, You've given us the castle, haven't you? END
BEGIN NOW It's yours, answered the Then you aren't welcome in our home, said the Second Daughter. END
BEGIN NOW Go find yourself somewhere else to sleep. END
BEGIN NOW It is my house, you ungrateful wretches! END
BEGIN NOW No, answered the Eldest Daughter. END
BEGIN NOW It isn't. END
BEGIN NOW As Edel watched with the Duck, whose hands were over her mouth in horror, the daughters pushed and kicked the Duke out of the room, down the staircase and out of the front door into the dark and snowy night. END
BEGIN NOW The Duck said, He looks so sad. END
BEGIN NOW I can't leave him alone! END
BEGIN NOW She ran after the Duke, her braid flying loose behind her. END
BEGIN NOW Edel only smiled and took the back way out of the castle. END
BEGIN NOW — Raise the wind! END
BEGIN NOW said the Man Without Hands. END
BEGIN NOW Let the storm cover the town. END
BEGIN NOW Six marionettes cranked the great machine, and above in Gold Crown Town, the snow rose ever higher. END
BEGIN NOW Set the spotlights. END
BEGIN NOW Two marionettes lit two stages, both in the depths of the forest. END
BEGIN NOW Two more marionettes set up viewing windows. END
BEGIN NOW In one window, the Duke shivered in his thin robes, the snow settling on his head and arms. END
BEGIN NOW In another window, the Duke's youngest daughter sat, sobbing. END
BEGIN NOW Somewhere she'd found a shawl to cover her head with. END
BEGIN NOW Her silk gown was torn at the hem and covered in mud and snow. END
BEGIN NOW Good, said the Man Without Hands. END
BEGIN NOW Now, for the climax! END
BEGIN NOW He waved his arms towards the clockwork orchestra, and the music swelled over Gold Crown Town. END
BEGIN NOW — The Duck (Edel observed, through a small clockwork window) caught up with the Duke in a stand of firs heavy with snow. END
BEGIN NOW The moon was covered by clouds, but convenient lights lit the area around them. END
BEGIN NOW The wrinkled old Duke was sitting under a fir tree, trembling and beginning to cough. END
BEGIN NOW Are you okay? END
BEGIN NOW asked the Duck. END
BEGIN NOW She, too, had snow in her hair and uniform, but it didn't seem to trouble her. END
BEGIN NOW You shouldn't be out here! END
BEGIN NOW I mean, I guess you can be anywhere you want, but it's a cold night and nobody should be out here! END
BEGIN NOW I mean... she broke off. END
BEGIN NOW It doesn't matter. END
BEGIN NOW The Duke's voice was hoarse. END
BEGIN NOW I have no children and no home to go to. END
BEGIN NOW Let the snow come. END
BEGIN NOW That's not true! END
BEGIN NOW said the Duck. END
BEGIN NOW There are plenty of places you could go to in Gold Crown Town! END
BEGIN NOW You could go to my home. END
BEGIN NOW Then she added, very fast, Well, you can't because it's just a lake and the other one is a girls' dormitory, but there have to be lots of people who would be glad to have you stay with them! END
BEGIN NOW Miss Ebine has an inn, maybe there's a hotel there. END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW The Duke bent his head and closed his eyes. END
BEGIN NOW I am not loved. END
BEGIN NOW I don't care what happens to me. END
BEGIN NOW Well, you should care! END
BEGIN NOW I care! END
BEGIN NOW What happens to you is very important! END
BEGIN NOW The Duck nodded enthusiastically. END
BEGIN NOW From beyond the clockwork window, Edel could see her braid flapping in the air. END
BEGIN NOW It's... the Duke coughed and started his sentence over, It's very sweet of you. END
BEGIN NOW But I don't need your help. END
BEGIN NOW At that moment, the Duck's pendant flashed red. END
BEGIN NOW — Elsewhere in the forest, Edel turned away from her observation window and looked for the Duke's third daughter. END
BEGIN NOW There she was, in a patch of light, sitting on a rock and wiping her eyes with the corner of her shawl. END
BEGIN NOW Edel glided closer and set her hand to the barrel organ. END
BEGIN NOW The clockwork orchestra quieted so that she could play, the bright and cheerful melody sounding clearly through the cold air. END
BEGIN NOW Rattelia looked up. END
BEGIN NOW Would you like a jewel? END
BEGIN NOW Edel asked, setting aside her barrel organ and opening her box. END
BEGIN NOW Rattelia stared up at Edel.\...No. END
BEGIN NOW No, thank you. END
BEGIN NOW Edel smiled at Rattelia. END
BEGIN NOW This, she said, gesturing towards a green stone that glowed faintly in the night, is the jewel of steadfastness. END
BEGIN NOW Would you take a walk with me? END
BEGIN NOW The path to enlightenment is full of shadows, but the destination is as bright as morning. END
BEGIN NOW Edel closed the box and offered Rattelia her wooden hand. END
BEGIN NOW The Duke's daughter shrugged. END
BEGIN NOW I don't have anything better to do tonight. END
BEGIN NOW She took Edel's hand in her paw and began walking. END
BEGIN NOW Edel led Rattelia further and further from the place where the Duck was talking to the Duke, onthe other side of the clockwork window. END
BEGIN NOW — You had the heartshard, after all! END
BEGIN NOW the Duck cried out. END
BEGIN NOW She folded herself into a golden egg, and when she emerged again, she was Princess Tutu. END
BEGIN NOW Tutu stepped close to the Duke and took his hands. END
BEGIN NOW You said that you don't care what happens to you if no one loves you, but is that how you really feel? END
BEGIN NOW I... said the Duke, and coughed. END
BEGIN NOW I only ever wanted my daughters to love me. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing else was so important. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing else matters. END
BEGIN NOW Dance with me, said Princess Tutu, and they danced through the snow-covered forest. END
BEGIN NOW Tutu's pointed toes hardly touched the ground, but the Duke began to trip on tree roots, and twice he nearly fell before Tutu caught him. END
BEGIN NOW His breath hissed through his throat. END
BEGIN NOW At last a small red copy of the Prince emerged from inside the Duke and took over the dance with Princess Tutu. END
BEGIN NOW I am the desire for love, said the heartshard. END
BEGIN NOW Thank you, said Princess Tutu, smiling at the heartshard. END
BEGIN NOW Go back to Mytho now. END
BEGIN NOW The heartshard flickered and vanished. END
BEGIN NOW When it disappeared, both Tutu and Edel could see that the Duke was lying on the roots of a fir tree, coughing blood into the snow. END
BEGIN NOW — As they walked, Rattelia was saying to Edel, If he'd just told me that he loved me, and asked me if I loved him back, I wouldn't mind. END
BEGIN NOW But he plays games. END
BEGIN NOW Why did the gift of the castle have to rest on one of us giving the right answer? END
BEGIN NOW Edel led Rattelia past the banks of a creek. END
BEGIN NOW True answers and true gifts are not easy to find. END
BEGIN NOW I do love him, Rattelia said. END
BEGIN NOW I even love my sisters. END
BEGIN NOW But I refuse to do what he asks just because he asks it. END
BEGIN NOW I'm his daughter, not his prisoner, not his slave, and not his puppet. END
BEGIN NOW Edel forgot to move smoothly; her legs and arms jerked at the wooden joints. END
BEGIN NOW Rattelia paused as well. END
BEGIN NOW I'm sorry, was that offensive? END
BEGIN NOW I don't mean to insult puppets. END
BEGIN NOW Finding her cryptic smile again, since she knew one of the spotlights was focused on it, Edel answered, We all have strings that move us. END
BEGIN NOW Fortunate people can choose whether to pull against the strings. END
BEGIN NOW — Through the window, Princess Tutu knelt over the Duke. END
BEGIN NOW I'll help you get somewhere warm, she said, I'll call the flower petals, in just the same way I saved Mytho when he fell out the window. END
BEGIN NOW Tutu closed her eyes and extended her hand, reaching for the wind of petals. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing moved, except that the Duke kept coughing. END
BEGIN NOW I can't, Tutu said at last. END
BEGIN NOW Tears were freezing on her long eyelashes. END
BEGIN NOW I can't reach the flowers. END
BEGIN NOW It must be because it's winter and the flowers are dead. END
BEGIN NOW I'd pick you up, but you're too heavy. END
BEGIN NOW I don't know what to do. END
BEGIN NOW She touched the Duke's head. END
BEGIN NOW I'll find some help. END
BEGIN NOW I'll do something. END
BEGIN NOW I can't leave you alone, so— Tutu stood up. END
BEGIN NOW If I'm going to call for help... END
BEGIN NOW I guess I have to be Duck again, so people know who I am. END
BEGIN NOW She shook her head, and then she was only a girl with a long braid and a student uniform. END
BEGIN NOW Fakir! END
BEGIN NOW the Duck called into the night. END
BEGIN NOW Rue! END
BEGIN NOW Mytho! END
BEGIN NOW Can anyone hear me? END
BEGIN NOW Mr. Cat? END
BEGIN NOW Fakir? END
BEGIN NOW Please come, I need you! END
BEGIN NOW Fakir! END
BEGIN NOW she yelled again. END
BEGIN NOW The sound of her voice echoed through the woods, but no one responded. END
BEGIN NOW I bet they all went home, the Duck said. END
BEGIN NOW I bet everyone's back in bed at the Academy and they're sleeping, so they can't hear me. END
BEGIN NOW She sat down again, resting her arm on the Duke's shivering shoulders. END
BEGIN NOW I guess I'll just have to wait here with you. END
BEGIN NOW Maybe someone will come in the morning. END
BEGIN NOW Unless— The Duck pushed herself up again and yelled even louder than she had before. END
BEGIN NOW Miss Edel! END
BEGIN NOW Miss Edel! END
BEGIN NOW Can you hear me? END
BEGIN NOW I know you'll help him! END
BEGIN NOW — From the other side of the forest, and the other side of the clockwork window, Edel could, in fact, hear the Duck. END
BEGIN NOW She could also hear the Man Without Hands, addressing her from the great machine. END
BEGIN NOW You could help him, said the Man Without Hands. END
BEGIN NOW But you wouldn't, would you? END
BEGIN NOW You're my puppet. END
BEGIN NOW You wouldn't spoil this beautiful tragedy. END
BEGIN NOW Edel heard them both. END
BEGIN NOW She thought of how strange the Duck's arms felt, wrapped around her in the Duke's ballroom. END
BEGIN NOW She thought of her twelve sisters, pulling the levers and pulleys in the clock tower. END
BEGIN NOW We all have strings that move us. END
BEGIN NOW Edel smiled blandly at the spotlight, and led Rattelia further into the frozen night. END
BEGIN NOW You wouldn't dare! END
BEGIN NOW said the Man Without Hands. END
BEGIN NOW I'll disassemble you for parts. END
BEGIN NOW I'll use your heart to power the sewage pipes. END
BEGIN NOW I'll use your hair for towels to clean the gears, and then I'll burn them. END
BEGIN NOW Edel smiled again, and led Rattelia unerringly to the Duke and the Duck. END
BEGIN NOW In her ears, the Man Without Hands was screaming. END
BEGIN NOW Father! END
BEGIN NOW said Rattelia. END
BEGIN NOW Are you all right? END
BEGIN NOW The Duck ran to Edel and clung to her for a long moment. END
BEGIN NOW Miss Edel! END
BEGIN NOW I knew you'd come! END
BEGIN NOW I'm so sorry, the Duke said to Rattelia, between coughs. END
BEGIN NOW I shouldn't\... have made you answer\... like that. END
BEGIN NOW I'm sorry too, said Rattelia. END
BEGIN NOW Miss Edel, could you help me carry him somewhere warm? END
BEGIN NOW The Man Without Hands snorted. END
BEGIN NOW You've already disobeyed. END
BEGIN NOW What's one more disobedience? END
BEGIN NOW Edel said nothing, but bent and lifted the old rat in her arms, to carry him to Ebine's inn. END
BEGIN NOW — You! END
BEGIN NOW You will be operating the clock for at least a week, declared the Man Without Hands the next morning. END
BEGIN NOW Don't even think of stepping out into the town. END
BEGIN NOW Edel took her silent place among her sisters, making sure that at every hour, the great bells rang and the marionette dancers spun over Gold Crown Town. END
BEGIN NOW But she set up clockwork windows, and she watched. END
BEGIN NOW Through the first window, as the clock struck seven: The Prince, in his bed in the dormitory, was saying to the Fakir, do you love me? END
BEGIN NOW The Knight turned his face away and did not answer. END
BEGIN NOW Through the second window, as the clock struck eight: The Duke was lying in a neat bed in Ebine's inn. END
BEGIN NOW Rattelia sat by the bed. END
BEGIN NOW The Gold Crown Town doctor peered at the Duke through his spectacles. END
BEGIN NOW Take this medicine twice a day, and stay in bed for at least a week. END
BEGIN NOW You'll be fine. END
BEGIN NOW Will you help him remember his medicine? END
BEGIN NOW Of course, said Rattelia. END
BEGIN NOW Through the third window, as the clock struck nine: The Prince, at ballet practice, asked the Raven Princess, Do you love me, Rue? END
BEGIN NOW The Raven Princess said, Don't be ridiculous. END
BEGIN NOW Through the fourth window, as the clock struck ten: What took you so long last night? END
BEGIN NOW whispered Pique, while the Cat was occupied teaching the advanced class. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, we were wondering if you got lost! END
BEGIN NOW agreed Lilie, slightly louder. END
BEGIN NOW It was such a cold night, you might have frozen, and then we never would have found you! END
BEGIN NOW Oh, I'm fine, said the Duck, forgetting to be quiet. END
BEGIN NOW It was nothing. END
BEGIN NOW Back in the clock tower, Edel smiled and pulled another crank.  END
BEGIN NOW  No, Edgar winces. END
BEGIN NOW Silence, he commands. END
BEGIN NOW His advisors obey, and he winces again. END
BEGIN NOW How could he explain that he was talking to the air? END
BEGIN NOW But if he has their silence, he may as well speak. END
BEGIN NOW His advisors break out into frantic babbling: a king must marry, and the kingdom needs stability. END
BEGIN NOW At his side, Edgar flings himself from his chair and stalks out of the room, ignoring his advisors. END
BEGIN NOW He is young, he is new to the crown, he has inherited a kingdom thrown upside down and wracked with tragedy. END
BEGIN NOW He must be careful. END
BEGIN NOW He cannot go mad. END
BEGIN NOW &mdash;&mdash; Come, my boy! END
BEGIN NOW Why so glum? END
BEGIN NOW It's his father. END
BEGIN NOW I have no eyes and still I can see you sulking. END
BEGIN NOW You're king! END
BEGIN NOW Make the most of it! END
BEGIN NOW Edgar will say nothing. END
BEGIN NOW He doesn't want to embarrass himself in front of I know I would if I were in your place. END
BEGIN NOW Edgar can no longer contain himself. END
BEGIN NOW You're dead, he says. END
BEGIN NOW Of course I'm glum. END
BEGIN NOW Kent looks at him in surprise. END
BEGIN NOW Pardon me, my lord? END
BEGIN NOW he says. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing, Edgar mutters, then falls silent. END
BEGIN NOW But his eyes keep being drawn to where his father stands placidly nonexistent in the corner, and he knows Kent is worried. END
BEGIN NOW If their situations were reversed, he would be worried too. END
BEGIN NOW Even now, he is worried. END
BEGIN NOW &mdash;&mdash; Brother, walk with me. END
BEGIN NOW Turning, Edgar sees Edmund striding up to meet him, a wide smile on his face. END
BEGIN NOW Edgar says nothing, only turns back to the lady he was talking to, and says, Excuse me, I have some business to attend to. END
BEGIN NOW Then he follows Edmund. END
BEGIN NOW The lady's eyes trail him as he goes, looking confused. END
BEGIN NOW It is good to see you again, Edmund says. END
BEGIN NOW How is kingship treating you? END
BEGIN NOW Edgar gives a wan smile. END
BEGIN NOW Well enough, he says. END
BEGIN NOW How is being dead treating you, he does not say. END
BEGIN NOW But Edmund knows him too well, and can read the sentiment on his face. END
BEGIN NOW He laughs, and looks at Edgar, inviting him to share the joke. END
BEGIN NOW Edgar can't; how could he? END
BEGIN NOW Edmund is dead, and this is only an apparition, or the construct of his mind. END
BEGIN NOW Edmund sobers. END
BEGIN NOW You cannot live in the past forever, he says, and Edgar sighs. END
BEGIN NOW It would be easier if my past would stay buried, and allow me to move forward unencumbered. END
BEGIN NOW Do you really think so? END
BEGIN NOW Edmund glances around him, and his eyes follow a servant scuttling past who is very carefully not staring. END
BEGIN NOW I think you're encumbering yourself. END
BEGIN NOW I think you're encumbering me, Edgar snaps. END
BEGIN NOW Edmund only laughs, and then is gone. END
BEGIN NOW &mdash;&mdash; You can't hide away forever, Cordelia says. END
BEGIN NOW Edgar starts, and sits up. END
BEGIN NOW She's sitting on a stool by the fireplace, fiddling with a bit of kindling. END
BEGIN NOW Hiding? END
BEGIN NOW he says warily. END
BEGIN NOW I'm not hiding. END
BEGIN NOW You're doing nothing. END
BEGIN NOW Her voice is flat, and she glares at him. END
BEGIN NOW I'm trusting you with my father's kingdom. END
BEGIN NOW Don't ruin it more than he did. END
BEGIN NOW Edgar groans, and lies back down. END
BEGIN NOW He resists the urge to pull his covers over his head. END
BEGIN NOW There is silence. END
BEGIN NOW After a full half of an hour, he risks another look. END
BEGIN NOW Cordelia is still sitting there, the same expression on her face. END
BEGIN NOW Please go away, Edgar says. END
BEGIN NOW She says nothing. END
BEGIN NOW &mdash;&mdash; Give up, Lear says. END
BEGIN NOW You're a worse king than I was at the end. END
BEGIN NOW At least you have no conniving relatives trying to take over &mdash; any more, that is. END
BEGIN NOW Edgar puts his head in his hands, despairing. END
BEGIN NOW He cannot take any more of this. END
BEGIN NOW At least I was decisive. END
BEGIN NOW At least I accomplished things. END
BEGIN NOW Lear's smile is predatory. END
BEGIN NOW Edgar wishes he could just walk away from this conversation, but he can't: once again he is meeting with his advisors. END
BEGIN NOW The dead king is silent for a time, and Edgar twitches in anticipation of whatever he will choose to say next. END
BEGIN NOW Lear opens his mouth. END
BEGIN NOW He cannot stand this anymore. END
BEGIN NOW Edgar leaps to his feet, shouting, Hold your tongue! END
BEGIN NOW Have you nothing to do but bother me &mdash; any of you? END
BEGIN NOW Why must you torment me so? END
BEGIN NOW He draws in a ragged breath, then falls to his knees, facing the empty space where Lear had been, tears streaking down his face. END
BEGIN NOW Leave me alone. END
BEGIN NOW Please. END
BEGIN NOW I beg of you. END
BEGIN NOW If he looks mad, he doesn't care anymore; he's ready to do anything to rid himself of these spectres. END
BEGIN NOW He feels himself being lifted up, and he looks uncomprehending into Kent's face. END
BEGIN NOW Come with me, my lord, he says gently, and then barks out orders to the rest of the advisors, who hasten to do his bidding. END
BEGIN NOW Edgar's thoughts circle enough to make him dizzy, but they return again and again to this: Kent should have been king.  END
BEGIN NOW come with my lady hither. END
BEGIN NOW albany doesn’t think about madness until the servant who’s followed him around since cornwall’s death grabs him by the collar and tears him away from the king. END
BEGIN NOW pushing him against the wall, they whisper “you’re mad, you’re mad,” before they turn tail and run down the hall. END
BEGIN NOW calling for servants to chase after them, because these may be strange, unnatural times, but he is the king in everything but title, and he will not be addressed in that manner, albany returns to the king, offering him his arm. END
BEGIN NOW when his servants return to him empty handed, he is not overly concerned. END
BEGIN NOW the insolent servant may well have been the king of france’s, and his most royal majesty is returning to france the next morning, bearing cordelia’s body back with him, the unknown queen to be buried by her subjects as if they ever loved her. END
BEGIN NOW the king howls when news of the departure reaches his ears, his screams so loud that albany’s servant scuttle, refusing to go near that part of the castle. END
BEGIN NOW ever since the death of his daughter, the king - while more clear headed than he has been in a long time - is frail, never venturing much past the walls of the rooms albany gave him, refusing company, and sending meals back uneaten. END
BEGIN NOW albany supposes that after everything the king has been through, a man of his years is allowed to be frail. END
BEGIN NOW he may not have his daughter’s love, or gloucester's eyes - ah, gloucester's eyes. END
BEGIN NOW how grateful he would be to have them now - but the king does have albany, and he will be the most dutiful servant to the wretched king for as long as he is able. END
BEGIN NOW god save the king.  END
BEGIN NOW The king is mad. END
BEGIN NOW There are many things that are beyond Kent's knowledge, outside of his state, but this he knows. END
BEGIN NOW Wherefore this cruelty? END
BEGIN NOW Kind Lear, gentle Cordelia. END
BEGIN NOW Wherefore this pride? END
BEGIN NOW Will she not fashion herself to his liking? END
BEGIN NOW Not an hour ago, in this very hall, she sat with her father, with soft voice and soft touch in private conference; Kent waited beyond the doors, loathe to interrupt, though the king caught his eye and beckoned, and both smiled to see Kent. END
BEGIN NOW The king's face was rosy with pleasure, not anger, and Cordelia's voice was the sweetest music then.\.:. END
BEGIN NOW This now, this is beyond the bounds of courtesy, of kin. END
BEGIN NOW Banishment? END
BEGIN NOW Has the king no thought for any moment other than this? END
BEGIN NOW He is raging, blind to the thousand expressions of love ere this single one withheld. END
BEGIN NOW Can one turn all those into nothing? END
BEGIN NOW Good my liege - Peace, he says, and yes, Kent is trying for peace. END
BEGIN NOW Cease this obstinate silence, child; recover your words. END
BEGIN NOW Her fortune, Lear's fortune, they are both assured if she only speaks. END
BEGIN NOW The maps are drawn up. END
BEGIN NOW Do you not see? END
BEGIN NOW Lear's temper will fade, and all will be well. END
BEGIN NOW If only...\.:. END
BEGIN NOW Cordelia, a child, so often the first to greet her father and his company upon their return from outlying lands, bearing rosy kisses and joyful words. END
BEGIN NOW Even in these years, more woman than child, but never in the eyes of Lear. END
BEGIN NOW No; she is always Cordelia, his little bird - a promise, a sanctuary, with no queen to comfort him, nearly twenty years alone. END
BEGIN NOW Cordelia, too young to remember, her world bound by her father's arms. END
BEGIN NOW The others had years enough to recall a mother's touch, and yet not enough to understand the blamelessness of death. END
BEGIN NOW Someone must be at fault.\.:. END
BEGIN NOW Lear calls himself a dragon, a beast of fancy, imagination. END
BEGIN NOW Dragons do not exist; even in stories they are hunted out, destroyed. END
BEGIN NOW None will give refuge. END
BEGIN NOW Cordelia must stay, Lear must yield. END
BEGIN NOW Give up this foul pride, not befitting a daughter, and this rash anger, foreign to a kingly nature. END
BEGIN NOW Does Lear not know his daughters' truths, can he not see? END
BEGIN NOW In his grasp, security and peace, comfort in his old age. END
BEGIN NOW The dignity of a king. END
BEGIN NOW Is this no more? END
BEGIN NOW Duty. END
BEGIN NOW Allegiance. END
BEGIN NOW Love. END
BEGIN NOW Stronger than obedience, blind and unquestioning. END
BEGIN NOW Kent must speak, if Cordelia will not. END
BEGIN NOW See better,  END
BEGIN NOW It was too hot, How on earth could she be expected to stay indoors when it was stifling? END
BEGIN NOW She threw aside the book she was supposed to be reading and fell back onto the bed with a sigh. END
BEGIN NOW Her clothes were too thick and heavy for this weather; the window of her room had been thrown wide open but it provided little relief from the oppressive heat. END
BEGIN NOW Deciding that enough was enough, she rolled off the bed, landing with a soft ‘smack’ on to the floor. END
BEGIN NOW She wriggled her arm and shoulder into the gap between the bed and the floor, grasping blindly until her fingers closed around the drawstring of a canvas bag. END
BEGIN NOW She yanked it out and tipped the contents out onto the bed. END
BEGIN NOW Hurriedly, she began peeling off the heavy dress that was currently sticking uncomfortably to her skin. END
BEGIN NOW It fell with a thump to the floor. END
BEGIN NOW She pulled on a pair of worn and supple boots and fled her room and burst through the door of her sister’s adjoining bedroom. END
BEGIN NOW Regan was sat primly by her window, sewing with a methodical patience. END
BEGIN NOW She looked up briefly from her task as her door banged against the wall with her sister’s ferocious entrance. END
BEGIN NOW “What on earth are you wearing?” “Clothes. END
BEGIN NOW It was too hot in that dress. END
BEGIN NOW Besides, I like these.” Regan just shrugged and turned back to her sewing. END
BEGIN NOW “Come on, put that down and let’s go play.” “I can’t. END
BEGIN NOW And you can’t either. END
BEGIN NOW What if father catches us?” “He won’t. END
BEGIN NOW Come on, Regan, please? END
BEGIN NOW We could go down to the beach to find mermaids or go dragon hunting or build a den. END
BEGIN NOW Anything’s better than being stuck here all day.” Regan nibbled at her nails, uncertainty written all over her face. END
BEGIN NOW “We won’t get in trouble, will we? END
BEGIN NOW We won’t get caught?” “Don’t be silly! END
BEGIN NOW Have I ever let you get into trouble before?” Regan gave a small shake of the head before giving “All right then. END
BEGIN NOW Let’s go!” With a short stop off to collect Cordelia the sisters quickly and quietly snuck through the servants’ quarters and into the kitchens. END
BEGIN NOW The kitchens were always a hub of noise and activity; no-one paid any attention to anything that wasn’t a dish in progress or a pot to be washed, making it exceptionally easy for the children to run through to the door that would lead them straight out to the courtyard and the great outdoors. END
BEGIN NOW Once they were safely out, “Where are we going to go then?” Regan asked. END
BEGIN NOW “Well, we could go over the cliffs and then head down to the beach?” Cordelia squealed excitedly. END
BEGIN NOW “Crabbing!” “No, Delia, we can’t go crabbing today, we haven’t any lines or bait,” Regan explained, “We don’t have any food for ourselves actually. END
BEGIN NOW And it is getting close to lunch time.” “Well sorry for trying to have a bit of fun,” Okay?” Without waiting for a reply, she turned about and jogged back to the closed door. END
BEGIN NOW Regan took hold of Cordelia’s hand and gently tugged her towards the direction of the paddock. END
BEGIN NOW “Come along then, if we sit under the trees we can have a bit of shade.” The two girls squeezed under the lowest railing of the wooden fence that bordered the paddock where three ponies were lazily grazing. END
BEGIN NOW The dappled grey raised his head to watch them for a moment but lost interest quickly in favour of the sweet grass. END
BEGIN NOW Regan primly sat herself beneath the large tree in the corner of the paddock, spreading her skirt neatly around her. END
BEGIN NOW She plucked a nearby daisy from the ground and pushed her nail through the stalk and started making a daisy chain. END
BEGIN NOW Cordelia sat opposite her, watching attentively with wide eyes. END
BEGIN NOW “Why does “She doesn’t.” “Yes she does, sometimes. END
BEGIN NOW She’s wearing boy clothes today. END
BEGIN NOW She’s done it before. END
BEGIN NOW Why?” “I don’t know,” Regan snapped, “She just thinks they’re comfortable I think.” Cordelia nodded and fell silent, her brow furrowed as she mulled it over in her mind. END
BEGIN NOW “Does Goneril want to be a boy?” Regan put down the chain she was working on and held her arms open as an invitation for Cordelia to climb into her lap. END
BEGIN NOW She idly began putting small plaits into her fine hair, trying to put into words something neither she, nor “ ” “Oh. END
BEGIN NOW Okay. END
BEGIN NOW Can you teach me how to make daisy chains please?” By the time they saw “ “Oh wow, Delia! END
BEGIN NOW That’s great! END
BEGIN NOW Thank you! END
BEGIN NOW Here, put it on me.” She bent down so that Cordelia could drape the chain around her neck. END
BEGIN NOW “Why have you got so much stuff?” Regan asked, having followed Cordelia at a more leisurely pace. END
BEGIN NOW “Well, we have food,” Goneril lifted up a wicker picnic basket, “And if we’re going to go crabbing, we need lines, don’t we?” Cordelia laughed brightly, clapping her hands together as she ran in circles chanting: “We’re going crabbing! END
BEGIN NOW We’re going crabbing!” until Regan grabbed her and clamped a hand over her mouth. END
BEGIN NOW The sun was at its height as the three made their way over the cliffs towards the stretch of secluded beach. END
BEGIN NOW A windy and narrow path down the cliff face was the only means of reaching the sands below. END
BEGIN NOW She knelt down to allow Cordelia to climb up onto her back, her small arms grasped tightly around The first step down the slope was a little steep and “Delia! END
BEGIN NOW Don’t do that!” she scolded, “It’s fine, I’m not going to drop you!” “Sorry.” Cordelia whispered plaintively, pressing a small kiss of apology to her sister’s cheek. END
BEGIN NOW “Well … it’s fine. END
BEGIN NOW Just stay still from now on.” Regan followed with trepidation, having always hated that this was the only route down to the beach. END
BEGIN NOW She very delicately tested the solidity of the ground with each step with her toes before committing her foot to the step. END
BEGIN NOW Her eyes were firmly set on her feet with her arms stretched out at her sides for balance. END
BEGIN NOW Eventually they were all happily tucking into the ‘last minute picnic’ that as it turned out consisted of nothing but a variety of cakes and a couple of large bottles of pink lemonade. END
BEGIN NOW “I can’t believe you forgot the cups.” Regan said, wrinkling her nose at having to take a drink directly from the bottle. END
BEGIN NOW “It’s more to carry. END
BEGIN NOW We didn’t need them,” she explained. END
BEGIN NOW “It’s not polite to drink from the bottle.” “Well no-one’s around to see, are they? END
BEGIN NOW Just drink it or go thirsty!” The two glared at each other for a moment in stony silence which Regan was the first to break with a perturbed huff. END
BEGIN NOW “Can we go crabbing now?” Cordelia asked very softly, gently tugging on “Yes, let’s go have some fun!” They gathered their lines and bait and buckets and began trekking over the sands. END
BEGIN NOW At the far end of the beach was a natural pool hidden within the rocks. END
BEGIN NOW When the tide washed in it covered the rocks completely but when it receded it left still, salty waters contained in what was essentially a giant rock pool. END
BEGIN NOW Ideal for swimming and perfect for crabbing. END
BEGIN NOW The girls sat at the edge of the pool, feet dangling into the warm water; Cordelia watching the ripples with fascination whilst “Now, Delia, do you want to sit on my lap and help me catch some crabs?” Together they cast the line and felt the weight at the end drag their hook to the bottom. END
BEGIN NOW After a minute or two, Cordelia, whose hand was around “We got one!” “You think so? END
BEGIN NOW Is it tugging?” “Yes! END
BEGIN NOW Yes!” she giggled delightedly. END
BEGIN NOW “Alright then, get off me and I’ll pull it up.” “Quick! END
BEGIN NOW Quick! END
BEGIN NOW Here’s the bucket!” Regan prompted. END
BEGIN NOW As gently as she could, “He looks like Mr Kent.” Cordelia chuckled. END
BEGIN NOW “Cordelia!” Regan gasped, appalled, as ” “Why not? END
BEGIN NOW It’s funny!” ” “I suppose he does a bit,” Regan conceded, her lips pursing in an attempt not to smile, “Let’s see if we can find one that looks like Edmund. END
BEGIN NOW All cross and red!” “And he pinches.” Cordelia pouted. END
BEGIN NOW The laughter of the three little girls carried out across the sands, ringing out amidst the rocks. END
BEGIN NOW The day was hot and stifling. END
BEGIN NOW It was the perfect day to sneak out and find crabs that looked like mean little boys; nothing could have been finer.  END
BEGIN NOW  A Certain great King once did rule over this Land, Who had all the Pleasure a King cold commend And livd in great Splendor with Honour and Peae, He reignd many Years not without great Increase. END
BEGIN NOW He had three fine Daughters of Beauty most bright, In whom this same King he did take much Delight; For Virtue and Wisdom none could them come near, Which caused their Father to love them most dear. END
BEGIN NOW The King had a Fancy to try all their Love, Which pleased him well then this Question to move, To see which of them then did love him the best, So calld them before him the Truth to protest. END
BEGIN NOW For unto my Joy and Comfort I see Three beautiful Children do stand before me: Now which of you three will do most for my Sake, Suppose that my Life now should lie at the Stake? END
BEGIN NOW To which then the Elder did make this Reply, The worst of all Deaths for thy Sake I could die, With the greatest of Tortures that Nature can name; O this I will bear for your Majestys Fame! END
BEGIN NOW The second made Answer, My Love is more dear Than ever my Sisters, as it shall appear; Although she expresses much Fidelity, My Love shall be seen unto your Majesty! END
BEGIN NOW Well spoke, my dear Daughters, the aged King said, My Heart is enamourd, and merely betrayd: But what says my youngest Girl? END
BEGIN NOW Prithee tell me, I want to hear thy Love amongst all the Three. END
BEGIN NOW My Love, said the Youngest, that I to you owe, Is the abundant Duty a Child ought to show; To honour my Father until that I die, And neer in Extremity from you will fly. END
BEGIN NOW Thy Love is but small, said the King, I do find, That youll shew no more than what Nature doth bind; I thought you had Reason to be as sincere As your eldest Sister, who loves me most dear. END
BEGIN NOW Henceforth I do banish you quite from my Court, And charge you no more in my Presence resort: I justly may say, thou art no Child of mine, Because you in Love from the Rest do decline. END
BEGIN NOW So I will make over my Scepter and Crown To your eldest Sisters of Fame and Renown; And they shall be Heirs to my whole Land, For all that I have shall be at their Command. END
BEGIN NOW My pompous Estate, nay, and my noble Train, For those thy two Sisters shall be to maintain; That peaceable now I may pass my Time away, And live with my Daughters till my dying Day. END
BEGIN NOW PART II. END
BEGIN NOW The youngest Daughters Misfortune; of her travelling into France; and how the King of France made her his Queen, THEIR flattring Speeches at length won his Heart, But now mind at length how he had his Desert; For his youngest Daughters causeless Banishment, The which he had Reason eer long to repent. END
BEGIN NOW For his poor young Daughter he wanderd up and down, Through many a Village and brave English Town; Because that her Father held her in Disdain, She then did resolve for to cross oer the Main. END
BEGIN NOW At length to fair France then this fair Lady came, The King then perceiving this beautiful Dame, He quickly was wounded by young Cupids Dart, Which deeply did wound him to the very Heart. END
BEGIN NOW Likewise the King of her Virtues had heard, His Heart was more and more to her endeard: Said he, That my Love to her shall be seen, Before my whole Court I will make her my Queen. END
BEGIN NOW Her aged old Father is now all the While With his eldest Daughters, who soon did beguile Him of his whole Kingdom, nay, Scepter and Crown, And quickly their aged old Father pulld down. END
BEGIN NOW The King for a While in his Court did remain, But his eldest Daughter soon lessend his Train: Then after so done, she did quickly contrive Him of all his Riches and Means to deprive. END
BEGIN NOW Whereas twenty Men he was wont for to have, To wait and attend on his Majesty grave: She lessend his Number, and brought him to ten, And quickly reducd them to only three Men. END
BEGIN NOW Nay, one she thought much for her Father to have, So took him away, that her Father m ght leave The Court and be gone, and there no longer stay, Which grieved the King, and made him thus say, Am I thus rewarded, the King then replyd, To be of my own at this Rate so denyd? END
BEGIN NOW It grieveth my Heart to think what Ive done, But now to my second Child Ill make my Moan. END
BEGIN NOW PART III. END
BEGIN NOW How the King was dethrond by his two eldest Daughters; and how his youngest Daughter restored him again. END
BEGIN NOW MY second dear Daughter with Pity I know, Will quickly consider my Sorrow and Woe; Ill go now unto her, and tell her my Grief, I make no Doubt but shell afford me Relief. END
BEGIN NOW The King he full fast to the Court then did go, Desiring his Sorrows for to let her know: She made him this Answer, That she was much grievd For all these Repulses that he had receivd, But no Ways could help him in this his Distress, Nor yet in the least could afford him Redress; But if he a While in the Kitchen would stay, Shed order him such as the Scullions give away. END
BEGIN NOW The King made this Answer to his Daughter then, Surely I am served the worst of all Men; For doing as I did by my Daughter dear, Which makes me lament, and shed many a Tear. END
BEGIN NOW To my eldest Daughter again Ill return, Perhaps shell give Ear to my pitiful Moan. END
BEGIN NOW Then straitway he went again to the Court, In Hopes to find her in a better Sort. END
BEGIN NOW And when he came there she straitway gave Command, For to have him sent away out of Hand; And orderd them quickly to drive him away, Saying, That in her Court he no longe should stay. END
BEGIN NOW Then he to his second Child again did hie, To eat of her Scraps that her Scullion set by, For such as for Charity askd at the Door Which grieved the King to the Heart more and more. END
BEGIN NOW But there of her Promise he then was denyd, Which caused the King to be dissatisfyd For on his refusing her Offer most kind, She said, At her Gate he small Comfor;t should find. END
BEGIN NOW Calling to Remembrance his young Daughters Word. END
BEGIN NOW It did to his Grief new Sorrow afford; To think how he had this poor Creature beguild Of all her whole Fortune, and ruind the Child. END
BEGIN NOW Which made him be troubled, nay, to rave a d tear, And rending the Locks of his Silver Hair; Which was such an Ornament to his old Age, Yet nothing at all could his Trouble asswage. END
BEGIN NOW To Rocks, and to Rivers, and watry Founts, To Hills, and to Woods, and he highest of Mounts He made his Complaint, and his hourly Moan, Until at length all those Things seemd to Then being thus possest with Discontent, Being fully resolvd, he over Sea went, And soon found his Daughter, being Queen of Frnce, Which made him amazed at her noble Chance. END
BEGIN NOW Most virtuous Lady! END
BEGIN NOW when this she did hear, She sent for her Father in Duty most dear: Most welcome are you, my reverend Lord, To what my whole Kingdom and Court doth afford. END
BEGIN NOW Then her noble King, for to grace his Queen, Shewd him all the Honour and Love could be seen: He for his whole Court then of Noblemen sent, For great Acclamations of Joy they were bent. END
BEGIN NOW But as they in Banqueting merrily were, She said, My dear Father how goes your Affairs? END
BEGIN NOW Indeed, my dear Daughter, I quite am disownd By your eldest Sisters, who have me dethrond. END
BEGIN NOW Then she started up from the Table, and said, Of my cruel Sisters, who have the betrayd, I will be revenged, and that instantly, If that I am sure in the Battle to die. END
BEGIN NOW The King and his Nobles did soon Answer make, My honoured Queen, for your dear Fathers Sake, Well venture our Lives to see him on the Throne In Spight of all those that do him disown. END
BEGIN NOW Then straight unto England they came in great Haste, But now comes the Tragedy here at the last; The Fight was no sooner begun, to be plain, But this noble Queen in the Battle was slain. END
BEGIN NOW The Queen being dead, then her Father espyd, He laid himself by her, and instantly dyd: Then straightway seeing this sudden Event, They put the two Daughters to Death by Consent. END
BEGIN NOW The Crown was left vacant, for Want of an Heir, There being none equal the Crown for to wear: The Crown was left useless, being without King, So sad Disobedience is the wost of all Sin.  END
BEGIN NOW KING Lear once ruled in this land, With princely pride and peace: And had all things with content That might his joys increase: Amongst those things that nature gave, Three daughters fair had he, So princely seeming beautiful, As fairer could not be. END
BEGIN NOW So on a time it pleasd the king, A question thus to move: Which of his daughters to his grace Could shew the dearest love. END
BEGIN NOW For to my age you bring content; Quoth he, then let me hear Which of you three in plighted troth The kindest will appear. END
BEGIN NOW To this the eldest first began, Dear father mild, quoth she, Before your face to do you good My blood shall renderd be: And for your sake my bleeding heart Shall there be cut in twain, Ere that I see your reverend age The smallest grief sustain. END
BEGIN NOW And so will I, the second said, Dear father for your sake; The worst of all extremities For you Ill undertake. END
BEGIN NOW And serve your highness night and day, With diligen et content an pure delight, Discomfort may remove, In doing so, you glad my soul, The aged father replyd. END
BEGIN NOW But what sayist thou, my youngest girl, How stands thy love allyd! END
BEGIN NOW My love, quoth young Cordelia, then, Which to your grace I owe; Shall be the duty of a child, And that is all I shall bestow. END
BEGIN NOW And wilt thou show no more, said he, Than doth thy duty bind? END
BEGIN NOW I well perceive thy love is small, When as no more we find. END
BEGIN NOW Henceforth I banish thee my court, Thou art no child of mine: Nor any part of this my realm, By favour shall be thine. END
BEGIN NOW Thy eldest sister offer more Than well I can demand; To whom I equally bestow My kingdom and my land. END
BEGIN NOW My pompeous state and all my goods That lovingly I may With those thy sisters be mantaind, Until my dying day. END
BEGIN NOW Thus flattering speaches won renown, By these two sisters here: The third had causeless banishment. END
BEGIN NOW Yet was her love most dear. END
BEGIN NOW For poor Cordelia patiently Went wandering up and down, Upheld, unpityd gentle maid, Thro many an English town. END
BEGIN NOW Until at last in famous France, She gentle fortune found: Tho poor and bare, yet she was deemd The fairest on the ground, Where when the King her virtue heard, And this fair lady seen. END
BEGIN NOW With full consent of all the court, He made her his wife and queen. END
BEGIN NOW Her father, old king Lear, this while With his two daughters staid, Forgetful of their promisd loves. END
BEGIN NOW Full soon the same denyd. END
BEGIN NOW And living in Queen Regans court, The eldest of the twain, She took from him his chiefest means, And most of all his train, But whereas twenty men were wont To wait with bended knee; She gave allowance unto ten, And after scarce to three. END
BEGIN NOW Nay, one she thought to much for him So she took all away In hopes that in her court, good king! END
BEGIN NOW He would no longer stay. END
BEGIN NOW Am I rewarded thus, said he, For giving all I have Unto children? END
BEGIN NOW and to beg For what I want or crave. END
BEGIN NOW Ill go unto my Goneril, My second child, I know Will be more kind and beautiful, And will relieve my woe. END
BEGIN NOW Full fast he hies unto her court. END
BEGIN NOW Where when she hears his moan, Returnd him answer that she grievd That all his means were gone. END
BEGIN NOW But no ways could relieve his wants, Yet if that he would stay, Within her kitchen, he might have What scullions gave away. END
BEGIN NOW When he had heard with bitter tears, He made this answer then, In what I did let me be made Examples to all men. END
BEGIN NOW I will return again, said he, Unto my Regan court; She will not use me thus, I hope, But in a kinder sort. END
BEGIN NOW Where when he came she gave command To drive him thence away: When he was well within my court, Quoth she, he could not stay. END
BEGIN NOW Then back again to Goneril, The woeful king did hie: That in her kitchen he might have, What scullions did set by. END
BEGIN NOW But there of that he was denyd, Which he had promisd late; For once refusing he should not Come after to her gate. END
BEGIN NOW Thus twixt his daughters, for relief, He wanderd up and down, Being glad to feed on beggars food, That lately wore a crown. END
BEGIN NOW And calling to remembrance then His youngest daughters words, Who said the duty of a child Was all that love affords; But doubting to repair to her, Whom he had banishd so, Grew frantic mad, and in his mind, He bore the wounds of woe. END
BEGIN NOW Which made him rend his milk white locks, And tresses from his head: And all with blood bestaind his cheeks, With age and honor spread. END
BEGIN NOW To hills and woods and watery founts He made his hourly moan, To hills and woods and senseless things, Did seem to sigh and groan. END
BEGIN NOW Even thus pressd with discontent He passed oer to France. END
BEGIN NOW In hopes from kind Cordelia there, To find some gentler chance. END
BEGIN NOW Most virtuous dame! END
BEGIN NOW which when she heard Of this her fathers grief, As in duty bound, she quickly sent Him comfort and relief. END
BEGIN NOW And by a train of noble peers, In brave and gallant sort, She gave in charge he should be brought To Againipuss court; Whose royal king, whose noble mind, So freely gave consent To muster up his knights at arms, To fame and courage bent. END
BEGIN NOW And so to England came with speed, To repossess king Lear; And drive his daughters from their thrones By his Cordalia dear. END
BEGIN NOW Where she, true hearted noble queen, Was in the battle slain; Yet he, good king, in his old days Possessd his crown again. END
BEGIN NOW But when he heard of Cordelias death, Who dyd indeed for love Of her dear father in whose cause She did the battle move; He swooning fell upon her breast From whence he never parted; But on her bosom left his life, That was so truly hearted. END
BEGIN NOW The Lords and Nobles when they saw The end of these events, The other sisters unto death They doomed by consents. END
BEGIN NOW And being dead their crowns they left Unto the next of kin. END
BEGIN NOW Thus have you seen the fall of pride, And disobedient sin.  END
BEGIN NOW Bare interior. END
BEGIN NOW Grey Light. END
BEGIN NOW Left and right back, high up, two small windows, curtains drawn. END
BEGIN NOW Front right, a door. END
BEGIN NOW Hanging near door, its face to wall, a picture. END
BEGIN NOW Front left, touching each other, covered with an old sheet, two ashbins. END
BEGIN NOW Center, in an armchair on castors, covered with an old sheet, Hamm. END
BEGIN NOW Motionless by the door, his eyes fixed on Hamm, Clov. END
BEGIN NOW Very red face. END
BEGIN NOW Brief tableau. END
BEGIN NOW Clov goes and stands under window left. END
BEGIN NOW Stiff, staggering walk. END
BEGIN NOW He looks up at window left. END
BEGIN NOW He turns and looks at window right. END
BEGIN NOW He goes and stands under window right. END
BEGIN NOW He looks up at window right. END
BEGIN NOW He turns and looks at window left. END
BEGIN NOW He goes out, comes back immediately with a small step-ladder, carries it over and sets it down under window left, gets up on it, draws back curtain. END
BEGIN NOW He gets down, takes six steps (for example) towards window right, goes back for ladder, carries it over and sets it down under window right, gets up on it, draws back curtain. END
BEGIN NOW He gets down, takes three steps towards window left, goes back for ladder, carries it over and sets it down under window left, gets up on it, looks out of window. END
BEGIN NOW Brief laugh. END
BEGIN NOW He gets down, takes one step towards window right, goes back for ladder, carries it over and sets it down under window right, gets up on it, looks out of window. END
BEGIN NOW Brief laugh. END
BEGIN NOW He gets down, goes with ladder towards ashbins, halts, turns, carries back ladder and sets it down under window right, goes to ashbins, removes sheet covering them, folds it over his arm. END
BEGIN NOW He raises one lid, stoops and looks into bin. END
BEGIN NOW Brief laugh. END
BEGIN NOW He closes lid. END
BEGIN NOW Same with other bin. END
BEGIN NOW He goes to Hamm, removes sheet covering him, folds it over his arm. END
BEGIN NOW In a dressing-gown, a stiff toque on his head, a large blood-stained handkerchief over his face, a whistle hanging from his neck, a rug over his knees, thick socks on his feet, Hamm seems to be asleep. END
BEGIN NOW Clov looks him over. END
BEGIN NOW Brief laugh. END
BEGIN NOW He goes to door, halts, turns towards auditorium. END
BEGIN NOW CLOV (fixed gaze, tonelessly): Finished, it's finished, nearly finished, it must be nearly finished. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Grain upon grain, one by one, and one day, suddenly, there's a heap, a little heap, the impossible heap. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW I can't be punished any more. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW I'll go now to my kitchen, ten feet by ten feet by ten feet, and wait for him to whistle me. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Nice dimensions, nice proportions, I'll lean on the table, and look at the wall, and wait for him to whistle me. END
BEGIN NOW (He remains a moment motionless, then goes out. END
BEGIN NOW He comes back immediately, goes to window right, takes up the ladder and carries it out. END
BEGIN NOW Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Hamm stirs. END
BEGIN NOW He yawns under the handkerchief. END
BEGIN NOW He removes the handkerchief from his face. END
BEGIN NOW Very red face. END
BEGIN NOW Glasses with black lenses.) END
BEGIN NOW Me— (he yawns) —to play. END
BEGIN NOW (He takes off his glasses, wipes his eyes, his face, the glasses, puts them on again, folds the handkerchief and puts it back neatly in the breast pocket of his dressing gown. END
BEGIN NOW He clears his throat, joins the tips of his fingers.) END
BEGIN NOW Can there be misery— (he yawns) —loftier than mine? END
BEGIN NOW No doubt. END
BEGIN NOW Formerly. END
BEGIN NOW But now? END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW My father? END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW My mother? END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW My... dog? END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Oh I am willing to believe they suffer as much as such creatures can suffer. END
BEGIN NOW But does that mean their sufferings equal mine? END
BEGIN NOW No doubt. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW No, all is a— (he yawns) —bsolute, (proudly) the bigger a man is the fuller he is. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Gloomily.) END
BEGIN NOW And the emptier. END
BEGIN NOW (He sniffs.) END
BEGIN NOW Clov! END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW No, alone. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW What dreams! END
BEGIN NOW Those forests! END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Enough, it's time it ended, in the shelter, too. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW And yet I hesitate, I hesitate to... to end. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, there it is, it's time it ended and yet I hesitate to— (He yawns.) END
BEGIN NOW —to end. END
BEGIN NOW (Yawns.) END
BEGIN NOW God, I'm tired, I'd be better off in bed. END
BEGIN NOW (He whistles. END
BEGIN NOW Enter Clov immediately. END
BEGIN NOW He halts beside the chair.) END
BEGIN NOW You pollute the air! END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Get me ready, I'm going to bed. END
BEGIN NOW I've just got you up. END
BEGIN NOW And what of it? END
BEGIN NOW I can't be getting you up and putting you to bed every five minutes, I have things to do. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Did you ever see my eyes? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW Did you never have the curiosity, while I was sleeping, to take off my glasses and look at my eyes? END
BEGIN NOW Pulling back the lids? END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW One of these days I'll show them to you. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW It seems they've gone all white. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW What time is it? END
BEGIN NOW The same as usual. END
BEGIN NOW Have you looked? END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Well? END
BEGIN NOW Zero. END
BEGIN NOW It'd need to rain. END
BEGIN NOW It won't rain. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Apart from that, how do you feel? END
BEGIN NOW I don't complain. END
BEGIN NOW You feel normal? END
BEGIN NOW I tell you I don't complain. END
BEGIN NOW I feel a little strange. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Clov! END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Have you not had enough? END
BEGIN NOW Yes! END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Of what? END
BEGIN NOW Of this... this... thing. END
BEGIN NOW I always had. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Not you? END
BEGIN NOW Then there's no reason for it to change. END
BEGIN NOW It may end. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW All life long the same questions, the same answers. END
BEGIN NOW Get me ready. END
BEGIN NOW (Clov does not move.) END
BEGIN NOW Go and get the sheet. END
BEGIN NOW (Clov does not move.) END
BEGIN NOW Clov! END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW I'll give you nothing more to eat. END
BEGIN NOW Then we'll die. END
BEGIN NOW I'll give you just enough to keep you from dying. END
BEGIN NOW You'll be hungry all the time. END
BEGIN NOW Then we won't die. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW I'll go and get the sheet. END
BEGIN NOW (He goes towards the door.) END
BEGIN NOW No! END
BEGIN NOW (Clov halts.) END
BEGIN NOW I'll give you one biscuit per day. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW One and a half. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Why do you stay with me? END
BEGIN NOW Why do you keep me? END
BEGIN NOW There's no one else. END
BEGIN NOW There's nowhere else. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW You're leaving me all the same. END
BEGIN NOW I'm trying. END
BEGIN NOW You don't love me. END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW You loved me once. END
BEGIN NOW Once! END
BEGIN NOW I've made you suffer too much. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Haven't I? END
BEGIN NOW It's not that. END
BEGIN NOW I haven't made you suffer too much? END
BEGIN NOW Yes! END
BEGIN NOW Ah, you gave me a fright! END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Coldly) Forgive me. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Louder.) END
BEGIN NOW I said, Forgive me. END
BEGIN NOW I heard you. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Have you bled? END
BEGIN NOW Less. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Is it not time for my pain-killer? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW How are your eyes? END
BEGIN NOW Bad. END
BEGIN NOW How are your legs? END
BEGIN NOW Bad. END
BEGIN NOW But you can move. END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Then move! END
BEGIN NOW (Clov goes to back wall, leans against it with his forehead and hands.) END
BEGIN NOW Where are you? END
BEGIN NOW Here. END
BEGIN NOW Come back! END
BEGIN NOW (Clov returns to his place beside the chair.) END
BEGIN NOW Where are you? END
BEGIN NOW Here. END
BEGIN NOW Why don't you kill me? END
BEGIN NOW I don't know the combination of the cupboard. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Go and get two bicycle-wheels. END
BEGIN NOW There are no more bicycle-wheels. END
BEGIN NOW What have you done with your bicycle? END
BEGIN NOW I never had a bicycle. END
BEGIN NOW The thing is impossible. END
BEGIN NOW When there were still bicycles I wept to have one. END
BEGIN NOW I crawled at your feet. END
BEGIN NOW You told me to go to hell. END
BEGIN NOW Now there are none. END
BEGIN NOW And your rounds? END
BEGIN NOW When you inspected my paupers. END
BEGIN NOW Always on foot? END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes on horse. END
BEGIN NOW (The lid of one of the bins lifts and the hands of Nagg appear, gripping the rim. END
BEGIN NOW Then his head emerges. END
BEGIN NOW Nightcap. END
BEGIN NOW Very white face. END
BEGIN NOW Nagg yawns, then listens.) END
BEGIN NOW I'll leave you, I have things to do. END
BEGIN NOW In your kitchen? END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Outside of here it's death. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW All right, be off. END
BEGIN NOW (Exit Clov. END
BEGIN NOW Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW We're getting on. END
BEGIN NOW Me pap! END
BEGIN NOW Accursed progenitor! END
BEGIN NOW Me pap! END
BEGIN NOW The old folks at home! END
BEGIN NOW No decency left! END
BEGIN NOW Guzzle, guzzle, that's all they think of. END
BEGIN NOW (He whistles. END
BEGIN NOW Enter Clov. END
BEGIN NOW He halts beside the chair.) END
BEGIN NOW Well! END
BEGIN NOW I thought you were leaving me. END
BEGIN NOW Oh not just yet, not just yet. END
BEGIN NOW Me pap! END
BEGIN NOW Give him his pap. END
BEGIN NOW There's no more pap. END
BEGIN NOW Do you hear that? END
BEGIN NOW There's no more pap. END
BEGIN NOW You'll never get any more pap. END
BEGIN NOW I want me pap! END
BEGIN NOW Give him a biscuit. END
BEGIN NOW (Exit Clov.) END
BEGIN NOW Accursed fornicator! END
BEGIN NOW How are your stumps? END
BEGIN NOW Never mind me stumps. END
BEGIN NOW (Enter Clov with biscuit.) END
BEGIN NOW I'm back again, with the biscuit. END
BEGIN NOW (He gives biscuit to Nagg who fingers it, sniffs it.) END
BEGIN NOW What is it? END
BEGIN NOW Spratt's medium. END
BEGIN NOW It's hard! END
BEGIN NOW I can't! END
BEGIN NOW Bottle him! END
BEGIN NOW (Clov pushes Nagg back into the bin, closes the lid.) END
BEGIN NOW If age but knew! END
BEGIN NOW Sit on him! END
BEGIN NOW I can't sit. END
BEGIN NOW True. END
BEGIN NOW And I can't stand. END
BEGIN NOW So it is. END
BEGIN NOW Every man his specialty. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW No phone calls? END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Don't we laugh? END
BEGIN NOW I don't feel like it. END
BEGIN NOW Nor I. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Clov! END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Nature has forgotten us. END
BEGIN NOW There's no more nature. END
BEGIN NOW No more nature! END
BEGIN NOW You exaggerate. END
BEGIN NOW In the vicinity. END
BEGIN NOW But we breathe, we change! END
BEGIN NOW We lose our hair, our teeth! END
BEGIN NOW Our bloom! END
BEGIN NOW Our ideals! END
BEGIN NOW Then she hasn't forgotten us. END
BEGIN NOW But you say there is none. END
BEGIN NOW No one that ever lived ever thought so crooked as we. END
BEGIN NOW We do what we can. END
BEGIN NOW We shouldn't. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW You're a bit of all right, aren't you? END
BEGIN NOW A smithereen. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW This is slow work. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Is it not time for my pain-killer? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW I'll leave you, I have things to do. END
BEGIN NOW In your kitchen? END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW What, I'd like to know. END
BEGIN NOW I look at the wall. END
BEGIN NOW The wall! END
BEGIN NOW And what do you see on your wall? END
BEGIN NOW Mene, mene? END
BEGIN NOW Naked bodies? END
BEGIN NOW I see my light dying. END
BEGIN NOW Your light dying! END
BEGIN NOW Listen to that! END
BEGIN NOW Well, it can die just as well here, your light. END
BEGIN NOW Take a look at me and then come back and tell me what you think of your light. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW You shouldn't speak to me like that. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Forgive me. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Louder.) END
BEGIN NOW I said, Forgive me. END
BEGIN NOW I heard you. END
BEGIN NOW (The lid of Nagg's bin lifts. END
BEGIN NOW His hands appear, gripping the rim. END
BEGIN NOW Then his head emerges. END
BEGIN NOW In his mouth the biscuit. END
BEGIN NOW He listens.) END
BEGIN NOW Did your seeds come up? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW Did you scratch round them to see if they had sprouted? END
BEGIN NOW They haven't sprouted. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps it's still too early. END
BEGIN NOW If they were going to sprout they would have sprouted. END
BEGIN NOW (Violently.) END
BEGIN NOW They'll never sprout! END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Nagg takes biscuit in his hand.) END
BEGIN NOW This is not much fun. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW But that's always the way at the end of the day, isn't it, Clov? END
BEGIN NOW Always. END
BEGIN NOW It's the end of the day like any other day, isn't it, Clov? END
BEGIN NOW Looks like it. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW What's happening, what's happening? END
BEGIN NOW Something is taking its course. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW All right, be off. END
BEGIN NOW (He leans back in his chair, remains motionless. END
BEGIN NOW Clov does not move, heaves a great groaning sigh. END
BEGIN NOW Hamm sits up.) END
BEGIN NOW I thought I told you to be off. END
BEGIN NOW I'm trying. END
BEGIN NOW (He goes to the door, halts.) END
BEGIN NOW Ever since I was whelped. END
BEGIN NOW (Exit Clov.) END
BEGIN NOW We're getting on. END
BEGIN NOW (He leans back in his chair, remains motionless. END
BEGIN NOW Nagg knocks on the lid of the other bin. END
BEGIN NOW Pause. END
BEGIN NOW He knocks harder. END
BEGIN NOW The lid lifts and the hands of Nell appear, gripping the rim. END
BEGIN NOW Then her head emerges. END
BEGIN NOW Lace cap. END
BEGIN NOW Very white face.) END
BEGIN NOW What is it, my pet? END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Time for love? END
BEGIN NOW Were you asleep? END
BEGIN NOW Oh no! END
BEGIN NOW Kiss me. END
BEGIN NOW We can't. END
BEGIN NOW Try. END
BEGIN NOW (Their heads strain towards each other, fail to meet, fall apart again.) END
BEGIN NOW Why this farce, day after day? END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW I've lost me tooth. END
BEGIN NOW When? END
BEGIN NOW I had it yesterday. END
BEGIN NOW Ah yesterday. END
BEGIN NOW (They turn painfully towards each other.) END
BEGIN NOW Can you see me? END
BEGIN NOW Hardly. END
BEGIN NOW And you? END
BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW Can you see me? END
BEGIN NOW Hardly. END
BEGIN NOW So much the better, so much the better. END
BEGIN NOW Don't say that. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Our sight has failed. END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW They turn away from each other.) END
BEGIN NOW Can you hear me? END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW And you? END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Our hearing hasn't failed. END
BEGIN NOW Our what? END
BEGIN NOW Our hearing. END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Have you anything else to say to me? END
BEGIN NOW Do you remember— No. END
BEGIN NOW When we crashed on our tandem and lost our shanks. END
BEGIN NOW (They laugh heartily.) END
BEGIN NOW It was in the Ardennes. END
BEGIN NOW (They laugh less heartily.) END
BEGIN NOW On the road to Sedan. END
BEGIN NOW (They laugh still less heartily.) END
BEGIN NOW Are you cold? END
BEGIN NOW Yes, perished, and you? END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW I'm freezing. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Do you want to go in? END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Then go in. END
BEGIN NOW (Nell does not move.) END
BEGIN NOW Why don't you go in? END
BEGIN NOW I don't know. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Has he changed your sawdust? END
BEGIN NOW It isn't sawdust. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Warily.) END
BEGIN NOW Can you not be a little accurate, Nagg? END
BEGIN NOW Your sand then. END
BEGIN NOW It's not important. END
BEGIN NOW It is important. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW It was sawdust once. END
BEGIN NOW Once! END
BEGIN NOW And now it's sand. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW From the shore. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Impatiently.) END
BEGIN NOW Now it's sand he fetches from the shore. END
BEGIN NOW Now it's sand. END
BEGIN NOW Has he changed yours? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW Nor mine. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW I won't have it! END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Holding up the biscuit.) END
BEGIN NOW Do you want a bit? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Of what? END
BEGIN NOW Biscuit. END
BEGIN NOW I've kept you half. END
BEGIN NOW (He looks at the biscuit. END
BEGIN NOW Proudly.) END
BEGIN NOW Three quarters. END
BEGIN NOW For you. END
BEGIN NOW Here. END
BEGIN NOW (He proffers the biscuit.) END
BEGIN NOW No? END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Do you not feel well? END
BEGIN NOW Quiet, quiet, you're keeping me awake. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Talk softer. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW If I could sleep I might make love. END
BEGIN NOW I'd go into the woods. END
BEGIN NOW My eyes would see... the sky, the earth. END
BEGIN NOW I'd run, run, they wouldn't catch me. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Nature! END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW There's something dripping in my head. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW A heart, a heart in my head. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Do you hear him? END
BEGIN NOW A heart in his head! END
BEGIN NOW (He chuckles cautiously.) END
BEGIN NOW One mustn't laugh at those things, Nagg. END
BEGIN NOW Why must you always laugh at them? END
BEGIN NOW Not so loud! END
BEGIN NOW Nothing is funnier than unhappiness, I grant you that. END
BEGIN NOW But— Oh! END
BEGIN NOW Yes, yes, it's the most comical thing in the world. END
BEGIN NOW And we laugh, we laugh, with a will, in the beginning. END
BEGIN NOW But it's always the same thing. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, it's like the funny story we have heard too often, we still find it funny, but we don't laugh any more. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Have you anything else to say to me? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW Are you quite sure? END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Then I'll leave you. END
BEGIN NOW Do you not want your biscuit? END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW I'll keep it for you. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW I thought you were going to leave me. END
BEGIN NOW I am going to leave you. END
BEGIN NOW Could you give me a scratch before you go? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Where? END
BEGIN NOW In the back. END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Rub yourself against the rim. END
BEGIN NOW It's lower down. END
BEGIN NOW In the hollow. END
BEGIN NOW What hollow? END
BEGIN NOW The hollow! END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Could you not? END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Yesterday you scratched me there. END
BEGIN NOW Ah yesterday. END
BEGIN NOW Could you not? END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Would you like me to scratch you? END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Are you crying again? END
BEGIN NOW I was trying. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps it's a little vein. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW What was that he said? END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps it's a little vein. END
BEGIN NOW What does that mean? END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW That means nothing. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Shall I tell you the story of the tailor? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW What for? END
BEGIN NOW To cheer you up. END
BEGIN NOW It's not funny. END
BEGIN NOW It always made you laugh. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW The first time I thought you'd die. END
BEGIN NOW It was on Lake Como. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW One April afternoon. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Can you believe it? END
BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW That we once went out rowing on Lake Como. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW One April afternoon. END
BEGIN NOW We had got engaged the day before. END
BEGIN NOW Engaged! END
BEGIN NOW You were in such fits that we capsized. END
BEGIN NOW By rights we should have been drowned. END
BEGIN NOW It was because I felt happy. END
BEGIN NOW It was not, it was not, it was my STORY and nothing else. END
BEGIN NOW Happy! END
BEGIN NOW Don't you laugh at it still? END
BEGIN NOW Every time I tell it. END
BEGIN NOW Happy! END
BEGIN NOW It was deep, deep. END
BEGIN NOW And you could see down to the bottom. END
BEGIN NOW So white. END
BEGIN NOW So clean. END
BEGIN NOW Let me tell it again. END
BEGIN NOW (Raconteur's voice.) END
BEGIN NOW An Englishman, needing a pair of striped trousers in a hurry for the New Year festivities, goes to his tailor who takes his measurements. END
BEGIN NOW (Tailor's voice.) END
BEGIN NOW That's the lot, come back in four days, I'll have it ready. END
BEGIN NOW Good. END
BEGIN NOW Four days later. END
BEGIN NOW (Tailor's voice.) END
BEGIN NOW So sorry, come back in a week, I've made a mess of the seat. END
BEGIN NOW Good, that's all right, a neat seat can be very ticklish. END
BEGIN NOW A week later. END
BEGIN NOW (Tailor's voice.) END
BEGIN NOW Frightfully sorry, come back in ten days, I've made a hash of the crotch. END
BEGIN NOW Good, can't be helped, a snug crotch is always a teaser. END
BEGIN NOW Ten days later. END
BEGIN NOW (Tailor's voice.) END
BEGIN NOW Dreadfully sorry, come back in a fortnight, I've made a balls of the fly. END
BEGIN NOW Good, at a pinch, a smart fly is a stiff proposition. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Normal voice.) END
BEGIN NOW I never told it worse. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Gloomy.) END
BEGIN NOW I tell this story worse and worse. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Raconteur's voice.) END
BEGIN NOW Well, to make it short, the bluebells are blowing and he ballockses the buttonholes. END
BEGIN NOW (Customer's voice.) END
BEGIN NOW God damn you to hell, Sir, no, it's indecent, there are limits! END
BEGIN NOW In six days, do you hear me, six days, God made the world. END
BEGIN NOW Yes Sir, no less Sir, the WORLD! END
BEGIN NOW And you are not bloody well capable of making me a pair of trousers in three months! END
BEGIN NOW (Tailor's voice, scandalized.) END
BEGIN NOW But my dear Sir, my dear Sir, look— (disdainful gesture, disgustedly) —at the world— (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW and look— (loving gesture, proudly) —at my TROUSERS! END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW He looks at Nell who has remained impassive, her eyes unseeing. END
BEGIN NOW He breaks into a high forced laugh, cuts it short, pokes his head towards Nell, launches his laugh again.) END
BEGIN NOW Silence! END
BEGIN NOW (Nagg starts, cuts short his laugh.) END
BEGIN NOW You could see down to the bottom. END
BEGIN NOW Have you not finished? END
BEGIN NOW Will you never finish? END
BEGIN NOW (With sudden fury.) END
BEGIN NOW Will this never finish? END
BEGIN NOW (Nagg disappears into his bin, closes the lid behind him. END
BEGIN NOW Nell does not move. END
BEGIN NOW Frenziedly.) END
BEGIN NOW My kingdom for a nightman! END
BEGIN NOW (He whistles. END
BEGIN NOW Enter Clov.) END
BEGIN NOW Clear away this muck! END
BEGIN NOW Chuck it in the sea! END
BEGIN NOW (Clov goes to bins, halts.) END
BEGIN NOW So white. END
BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW What's she blathering about? END
BEGIN NOW (Clov stoops, takes Nell's hand, feels her pulse.) END
BEGIN NOW Desert! END
BEGIN NOW (Clov lets go her hand, pushes her back in the bin, closes the lid.) END
BEGIN NOW She has no pulse. END
BEGIN NOW What was she drivelling about? END
BEGIN NOW She told me to go away, into the desert. END
BEGIN NOW Damn busybody! END
BEGIN NOW Is that all? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW What else? END
BEGIN NOW I didn't understand. END
BEGIN NOW Have you bottled her? END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Are they both bottled? END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Screw down the lids. END
BEGIN NOW (Clov goes towards door.) END
BEGIN NOW Time enough. END
BEGIN NOW (Clov halts.) END
BEGIN NOW My anger subsides, I'd like to pee. END
BEGIN NOW I'll go get the catheter. END
BEGIN NOW (He goes towards door.) END
BEGIN NOW Time enough. END
BEGIN NOW (Clov halts.) END
BEGIN NOW Give me my pain killer. END
BEGIN NOW It's too soon. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW It's too soon on top of your tonic, it wouldn't act. END
BEGIN NOW In the morning they brace you up and in the evening they calm you down. END
BEGIN NOW Unless it's the other way round. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW That old doctor, he's dead naturally? END
BEGIN NOW He wasn't old. END
BEGIN NOW But he's dead? END
BEGIN NOW Naturally. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW You ask me that? END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Take me for a little turn. END
BEGIN NOW (Clov goes behind the chair and pushes it forward.) END
BEGIN NOW Not too fast! END
BEGIN NOW (Clov pushes chair.) END
BEGIN NOW Right round the world! END
BEGIN NOW (Clov pushes chair.) END
BEGIN NOW Hug the walls, then back to the center again. END
BEGIN NOW (Clov pushes chair.) END
BEGIN NOW I was right in the center, wasn't I? END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW We'd need a proper wheel-chair. END
BEGIN NOW With big wheels. END
BEGIN NOW Bicycle wheels! END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Are you hugging? END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW It's a lie! END
BEGIN NOW Why do you lie to me? END
BEGIN NOW There! END
BEGIN NOW There! END
BEGIN NOW Stop! END
BEGIN NOW (Clov stops chair close to back wall. END
BEGIN NOW Hamm lays his hand against wall.) END
BEGIN NOW Old wall! END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Beyond is the... other hell. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Violently.) END
BEGIN NOW Closer! END
BEGIN NOW Closer! END
BEGIN NOW Up against! END
BEGIN NOW Take away your hand. END
BEGIN NOW (Hamm withdraws his hand. END
BEGIN NOW Clov rams chair against wall.) END
BEGIN NOW There! END
BEGIN NOW (Hamm leans towards wall, applies his ear to it.) END
BEGIN NOW Do you hear? END
BEGIN NOW (He strikes the wall with his knuckles.) END
BEGIN NOW Do you hear? END
BEGIN NOW Hollow bricks! END
BEGIN NOW (He strikes again.) END
BEGIN NOW All that's hollow! END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW He straightens up. END
BEGIN NOW Violently.) END
BEGIN NOW That's enough. END
BEGIN NOW Back! END
BEGIN NOW We haven't done the round. END
BEGIN NOW Back to my place! END
BEGIN NOW (Clov pushes chair back to center.) END
BEGIN NOW Is that my place? END
BEGIN NOW Yes, that's your place. END
BEGIN NOW Am I right in the center? END
BEGIN NOW I'll measure it. END
BEGIN NOW More or less! END
BEGIN NOW More or less! END
BEGIN NOW There! END
BEGIN NOW I'm more or less in the center? END
BEGIN NOW I'd say so. END
BEGIN NOW You'd say so! END
BEGIN NOW Put me right in the center! END
BEGIN NOW I'll go and get the tape. END
BEGIN NOW Roughly! END
BEGIN NOW Roughly! END
BEGIN NOW (Clov moves chair slightly.) END
BEGIN NOW Bang in the center! END
BEGIN NOW There! END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW I feel a little too far to the left. END
BEGIN NOW (Clov moves chair slightly.) END
BEGIN NOW Now I feel a little too far to the right. END
BEGIN NOW (Clov moves chair slightly.) END
BEGIN NOW I feel a little too far forward. END
BEGIN NOW (Clov moves chair slightly.) END
BEGIN NOW Now I feel a little too far back. END
BEGIN NOW (Clov moves chair slightly.) END
BEGIN NOW Don't stay there. END
BEGIN NOW (i.e. END
BEGIN NOW behind the chair) you give me the shivers. END
BEGIN NOW (Clov returns to his place beside the chair.) END
BEGIN NOW If I could kill him I'd die happy. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW What's the weather like? END
BEGIN NOW As usual. END
BEGIN NOW Look at the earth. END
BEGIN NOW I've looked. END
BEGIN NOW With the glass? END
BEGIN NOW No need of the glass. END
BEGIN NOW Look at it with the glass. END
BEGIN NOW I'll go and get the glass. END
BEGIN NOW (Exit Clov.) END
BEGIN NOW No need of the glass! END
BEGIN NOW (Enter Clov with telescope.) END
BEGIN NOW I'm back again, with the glass. END
BEGIN NOW (He goes to window right, looks up at it.) END
BEGIN NOW I need the steps. END
BEGIN NOW Why? END
BEGIN NOW Have you shrunk? END
BEGIN NOW (Exit Clov with telescope.) END
BEGIN NOW I don't like that, I don't like that. END
BEGIN NOW (Enter Clov with ladder, but without telescope.) END
BEGIN NOW I'm back again, with the steps. END
BEGIN NOW (He sets down ladder under window right, gets up on it, realizes he has not the telescope, gets down.) END
BEGIN NOW I need the glass. END
BEGIN NOW (He goes towards door.) END
BEGIN NOW But you have the glass! END
BEGIN NOW CLOV (halting, violently): No, I haven't the glass! END
BEGIN NOW (Exit Clov.) END
BEGIN NOW This is deadly. END
BEGIN NOW (Enter Clov with the telescope. END
BEGIN NOW He goes towards ladder.) END
BEGIN NOW Things are livening up. END
BEGIN NOW (He gets up on ladder, raises the telescope, lets it fall.) END
BEGIN NOW I did it on purpose. END
BEGIN NOW (He gets down, picks up the telescope, turns it on auditorium.) END
BEGIN NOW I see... a multitude... in transports... of joy. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW He lowers telescope, looks at it.) END
BEGIN NOW That's what I call a magnifier. END
BEGIN NOW (He turns toward Hamm.) END
BEGIN NOW Well? END
BEGIN NOW Don't we laugh? END
BEGIN NOW I don't. END
BEGIN NOW Nor I. END
BEGIN NOW (He gets up on ladder, turns the telescope on the without.) END
BEGIN NOW Let's see. END
BEGIN NOW (He looks, moving the telescope.) END
BEGIN NOW Zero... (he looks)\...zero... (he looks)\...and zero. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing stirs. END
BEGIN NOW All is— Zer— Wait till you're spoken to! END
BEGIN NOW (Normal voice.) END
BEGIN NOW All is... all is... all is what? END
BEGIN NOW (Violently.) END
BEGIN NOW All is what? END
BEGIN NOW What all is? END
BEGIN NOW In a word? END
BEGIN NOW Is that what you want to know? END
BEGIN NOW Just a moment. END
BEGIN NOW (He turns the telescope on the without, looks, lowers the telescope, turns towards Hamm.) END
BEGIN NOW Corpsed. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Well? END
BEGIN NOW Content? END
BEGIN NOW Look at the sea. END
BEGIN NOW It's the same. END
BEGIN NOW Look at the ocean! END
BEGIN NOW (Clov gets down, takes a few steps towards window left, goes back for ladder, carries it over and sets it down under window left, gets up on it, turns the telescope on the without, looks at length. END
BEGIN NOW He starts, lowers the telescope, examines it, turns it again on the without.) END
BEGIN NOW Never seen anything like that! END
BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW A sail? END
BEGIN NOW A fin? END
BEGIN NOW Smoke? END
BEGIN NOW The light is sunk. END
BEGIN NOW Pah! END
BEGIN NOW We all knew that. END
BEGIN NOW There was a bit left. END
BEGIN NOW The base. END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW And now? END
BEGIN NOW All gone. END
BEGIN NOW No gulls? END
BEGIN NOW Gulls! END
BEGIN NOW And the horizon? END
BEGIN NOW Nothing on the horizon? END
BEGIN NOW CLOV (lowering the telescope, turning towards Hamm, exasperated): What in God's name could there be on the horizon? END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW The waves, how are the waves? END
BEGIN NOW The waves? END
BEGIN NOW (He turns the telescope on the waves.) END
BEGIN NOW Lead. END
BEGIN NOW And the sun? END
BEGIN NOW Zero. END
BEGIN NOW But it should be sinking. END
BEGIN NOW Look again. END
BEGIN NOW Damn the sun. END
BEGIN NOW Is is night already then? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW Then what is it? END
BEGIN NOW Gray. END
BEGIN NOW (Lowering the telescope, turning towards Hamm, louder.) END
BEGIN NOW Gray! END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Still louder.) END
BEGIN NOW GRRAY! END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW He gets down, approaches Hamm from behind, whispers in his ear.) END
BEGIN NOW Gray! END
BEGIN NOW Did I hear you say gray? END
BEGIN NOW Light black. END
BEGIN NOW From pole to pole. END
BEGIN NOW You exaggerate. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Don't stay there, you give me the shivers. END
BEGIN NOW (Clov returns to his place beside the chair.) END
BEGIN NOW Why this farce, day after day? END
BEGIN NOW Routine. END
BEGIN NOW One never knows. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Last night I saw inside my breast. END
BEGIN NOW There was a big sore. END
BEGIN NOW Pah! END
BEGIN NOW You saw your heart. END
BEGIN NOW No, it was living. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Anguished.) END
BEGIN NOW Clov! END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW What's happening? END
BEGIN NOW Something is taking its course. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Clov! END
BEGIN NOW What is it? END
BEGIN NOW We're not beginning to... to... mean something? END
BEGIN NOW Mean something! END
BEGIN NOW You and I, mean something! END
BEGIN NOW (Brief laugh.) END
BEGIN NOW Ah that's a good one! END
BEGIN NOW I wonder. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Imagine if a rational being came back to earth, wouldn't he be liable to get ideas into his head if he observed us long enough. END
BEGIN NOW (Voice of rational being.) END
BEGIN NOW Ah, good, now I see what it is, yes, now I understand what they're at! END
BEGIN NOW (Clov starts, drops the telescope and begins to scratch his belly with both hands. END
BEGIN NOW Normal voice.) END
BEGIN NOW And without going so far as that, we ourselves... (with emotion)\...we ourselves... at certain moments... END
BEGIN NOW (Vehemently.) END
BEGIN NOW To think perhaps it won't all have been for nothing! END
BEGIN NOW CLOV (anguished, scratching himself): I have a flea! END
BEGIN NOW A flea! END
BEGIN NOW Are there still fleas? END
BEGIN NOW On me there's one. END
BEGIN NOW (Scratching.) END
BEGIN NOW Unless it's a crab louse. END
BEGIN NOW But humanity might start from there all over again! END
BEGIN NOW Catch him, for the love of God! END
BEGIN NOW I'll go and get the powder. END
BEGIN NOW (Exit Clov.) END
BEGIN NOW A flea! END
BEGIN NOW This is awful! END
BEGIN NOW What a day! END
BEGIN NOW (Enter Clov with a sprinkling-tin.) END
BEGIN NOW I'm back again, with the insecticide. END
BEGIN NOW Let him have it! END
BEGIN NOW (Clov loosens the top of his trousers, pulls it forward and shakes powder into the aperture. END
BEGIN NOW He stoops, looks, waits, starts, frenziedly shakes more powder, stoops, looks, waits.) END
BEGIN NOW The bastard! END
BEGIN NOW Did you get him? END
BEGIN NOW Looks like it. END
BEGIN NOW (He drops the tin and adjusts his trousers.) END
BEGIN NOW Unless he's laying doggo. END
BEGIN NOW Laying! END
BEGIN NOW Lying, you mean. END
BEGIN NOW Unless he's lying doggo. END
BEGIN NOW Ah? END
BEGIN NOW One says lying? END
BEGIN NOW One doesn't say laying? END
BEGIN NOW Use your head, can't you. END
BEGIN NOW If he was laying we'd be bitched. END
BEGIN NOW Ah. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW What about that pee? END
BEGIN NOW I'm having it. END
BEGIN NOW Ah that's the spirit, that's the spirit! END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Let's go from here, the two of us! END
BEGIN NOW South! END
BEGIN NOW You can make a raft and the currents will carry us away, far away, to other... mammals! END
BEGIN NOW God forbid! END
BEGIN NOW Alone, I'll embark alone! END
BEGIN NOW Get working on that raft immediately. END
BEGIN NOW Tomorrow I'll be gone forever. END
BEGIN NOW I'll start straight away. END
BEGIN NOW Wait! END
BEGIN NOW (Clov halts.) END
BEGIN NOW Will there be sharks, do you think? END
BEGIN NOW Sharks? END
BEGIN NOW I don't know. END
BEGIN NOW If there are there will be. END
BEGIN NOW (He goes towards door.) END
BEGIN NOW Wait! END
BEGIN NOW (Clov halts.) END
BEGIN NOW Is it not yet time for my pain-killer? END
BEGIN NOW No! END
BEGIN NOW (He goes towards door.) END
BEGIN NOW Wait! END
BEGIN NOW (Clov halts.) END
BEGIN NOW How are your eyes? END
BEGIN NOW Bad. END
BEGIN NOW But you can see. END
BEGIN NOW All I want. END
BEGIN NOW How are your legs? END
BEGIN NOW Bad. END
BEGIN NOW But you can walk. END
BEGIN NOW I come... and go. END
BEGIN NOW In my house. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW With prophetic relish.) END
BEGIN NOW One day you'll be blind like me. END
BEGIN NOW You'll be sitting here, a speck in the void, in the dark, forever, like me. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW One day you'll say to yourself, I'm tired, I'll sit down, and you'll go and sit down. END
BEGIN NOW Then you'll say, I'm hungry, I'll get up and get something to eat. END
BEGIN NOW But you won't get up. END
BEGIN NOW You'll say, I shouldn't have sat down, but since I have I'll sit on a little longer, then I'll get up and get something to eat. END
BEGIN NOW But you won't get up and you won't get anything to eat. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW You'll look at the wall a while, then you'll say, I'll close my eyes, perhaps have a little sleep, after that I'll feel better, and you'll close them. END
BEGIN NOW And when you open them again there'll be no wall any more. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Infinite emptiness will be all around you, all the resurrected dead of all the ages wouldn't fill it, and there you'll be like a little bit of grit in the middle of the steppe. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Yes, one day you'll know what it is, you'll be like me, except that you won't have anyone with you, because you won't have had pity on anyone and because there won't be anyone left to have pity on you. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW It's not certain. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW And there's one thing you forgot. END
BEGIN NOW Ah? END
BEGIN NOW I can't sit down. END
BEGIN NOW Well you'll lie down then, what the hell! END
BEGIN NOW Or you'll come to a standstill, simply stop and stand still, the way you are now. END
BEGIN NOW One day you'll say, I'm tired, I'll stop. END
BEGIN NOW What does the attitude matter? END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW So you all want me to leave you. END
BEGIN NOW Naturally. END
BEGIN NOW Then I'll leave you. END
BEGIN NOW You can't leave us. END
BEGIN NOW Then I won't leave you. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Why don't you finish us? END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW I'll tell you the combination of the cupboard if you promise to finish me. END
BEGIN NOW I couldn't finish you. END
BEGIN NOW Then you won't finish me. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW I'll leave you, I have things to do. END
BEGIN NOW Do you remember when you came here? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW Too small, you told me. END
BEGIN NOW Do you remember your father? END
BEGIN NOW Same answer. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW You've asked me these questions millions of times. END
BEGIN NOW I love the old questions. END
BEGIN NOW (With fervour.) END
BEGIN NOW Ah the old questions, the old answers, there's nothing like them! END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW It was I was a father to you. END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW (He looks at Hamm fixedly.) END
BEGIN NOW You were that to me. END
BEGIN NOW My house a home for you. END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW (He looks about him.) END
BEGIN NOW This was that for me. END
BEGIN NOW But for me, (gesture towards himself) no father. END
BEGIN NOW But for Hamm, (gesture towards surroundings) no home. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW I'll leave you. END
BEGIN NOW Did you ever think of one thing? END
BEGIN NOW Never. END
BEGIN NOW That here we're down in a hole. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW But beyond the hills? END
BEGIN NOW Eh? END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps it's still green. END
BEGIN NOW Eh? END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Flora! END
BEGIN NOW Pomona! END
BEGIN NOW (Ecstatically.) END
BEGIN NOW Ceres! END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps you won't need to go very far. END
BEGIN NOW I can't go very far. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW I'll leave you. END
BEGIN NOW Is my dog ready? END
BEGIN NOW He lacks a leg. END
BEGIN NOW Is he silky? END
BEGIN NOW He's kind of a Pomeranian. END
BEGIN NOW Go and get him. END
BEGIN NOW He lacks a leg. END
BEGIN NOW Go and get him! END
BEGIN NOW (Exit Clov.) END
BEGIN NOW We're getting on. END
BEGIN NOW (Enter Clov holding by one of its three legs a black toy dog.) END
BEGIN NOW Your dogs are here. END
BEGIN NOW (He hands the dog to Hamm who feels it, fondles it.) END
BEGIN NOW He's white, isn't he? END
BEGIN NOW Nearly. END
BEGIN NOW What do you mean, nearly? END
BEGIN NOW Is he white or isn't he? END
BEGIN NOW He isn't. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW You've forgotten the sex. END
BEGIN NOW But he isn't finished. END
BEGIN NOW The sex goes on at the end. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW You haven't put on his ribbon. END
BEGIN NOW But he isn't finished, I tell you! END
BEGIN NOW First you finish your dog and then you put on his ribbon! END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Can he stand? END
BEGIN NOW I don't know. END
BEGIN NOW Try. END
BEGIN NOW (He hands the dog to Clov who places it on the ground.) END
BEGIN NOW Well? END
BEGIN NOW Wait! END
BEGIN NOW (He squats down and tries to get the dog to stand on its three legs, fails, lets it go. END
BEGIN NOW The dog falls on its side.) END
BEGIN NOW Well? END
BEGIN NOW He's standing. END
BEGIN NOW Where? END
BEGIN NOW Where is he? END
BEGIN NOW (Clov holds up the dog in a standing position.) END
BEGIN NOW There. END
BEGIN NOW (He takes Hamm's hand and guides it towards the dog's head.) END
BEGIN NOW HAMM (his hand on the dog's head): Is he gazing at me? END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW As if he were asking me to take him for a walk? END
BEGIN NOW If you like. END
BEGIN NOW Or as if he were begging me for a bone. END
BEGIN NOW (He withdraws his hand.) END
BEGIN NOW Leave him like that, standing there imploring me. END
BEGIN NOW (Clov straightens up. END
BEGIN NOW The dog falls on its side.) END
BEGIN NOW I'll leave you. END
BEGIN NOW Have you had your visions? END
BEGIN NOW Less. END
BEGIN NOW Is Mother Pegg's light on? END
BEGIN NOW Light! END
BEGIN NOW How could anyone's light be on? END
BEGIN NOW Extinguished! END
BEGIN NOW Naturally it's extinguished. END
BEGIN NOW If it's not on it's extinguished. END
BEGIN NOW No, I mean Mother Pegg. END
BEGIN NOW But naturally she's extinguished! END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW What's the matter with you today? END
BEGIN NOW I'm taking my course. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Is she buried? END
BEGIN NOW Buried! END
BEGIN NOW Who would have buried her? END
BEGIN NOW You. END
BEGIN NOW Me! END
BEGIN NOW Haven't I enough to do without burying people? END
BEGIN NOW But you'll bury me. END
BEGIN NOW No I won't bury you. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW She was bonny once, like a flower of the field. END
BEGIN NOW (With reminiscent leer.) END
BEGIN NOW And a great one for the men! END
BEGIN NOW We too were bonny—once. END
BEGIN NOW It's a rare thing not to have been bonny—once. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Go and get the gaff. END
BEGIN NOW (Clov goes to the door, halts.) END
BEGIN NOW Do this, do that, and I do it. END
BEGIN NOW I never refuse. END
BEGIN NOW Why? END
BEGIN NOW You're not able to. END
BEGIN NOW Soon I won't do it any more. END
BEGIN NOW You won't be able to any more. END
BEGIN NOW (Exit Clov.) END
BEGIN NOW Ah the creatures, the creatures, everything has to be explained to them. END
BEGIN NOW (Enter Clov with gaff.) END
BEGIN NOW Here's your gaff. END
BEGIN NOW Stick it up. END
BEGIN NOW (He gives the gaff to Hamm who, wielding it like a puntpole, tries to move his chair.) END
BEGIN NOW Did I move? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW (Hamm throws down the gaff.) END
BEGIN NOW Go and get the oilcan. END
BEGIN NOW What for? END
BEGIN NOW To oil the castors. END
BEGIN NOW I oiled them yesterday. END
BEGIN NOW Yesterday! END
BEGIN NOW What does that mean? END
BEGIN NOW Yesterday! END
BEGIN NOW That means that bloody awful day, long ago, before this bloody awful day. END
BEGIN NOW I use the words you taught me. END
BEGIN NOW If they don't mean anything any more, teach me others. END
BEGIN NOW Or let me be silent. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW I once knew a madman who thought the end of the world had come. END
BEGIN NOW He was a painter—and engraver. END
BEGIN NOW I had a great fondness for him. END
BEGIN NOW I used to go and see him, in the asylum. END
BEGIN NOW I'd take him by the hand and drag him to the window. END
BEGIN NOW Look! END
BEGIN NOW There! END
BEGIN NOW All that rising corn! END
BEGIN NOW And there! END
BEGIN NOW Look! END
BEGIN NOW The sails of the herring fleet! END
BEGIN NOW All that loveliness! END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW He'd snatch away his hand and go back into his corner. END
BEGIN NOW Appalled. END
BEGIN NOW All he had seen was ashes. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW He alone had been spared. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Forgotten. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW It appears the case is... was not so... so unusual. END
BEGIN NOW A madman? END
BEGIN NOW When was that? END
BEGIN NOW Oh way back, way back, you weren't in the land of the living. END
BEGIN NOW God be with those days. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Hamm raises his toque.) END
BEGIN NOW I had a great fondness for him. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW He puts on his toque again.) END
BEGIN NOW He was a painter—and engraver. END
BEGIN NOW There are so many terrible things. END
BEGIN NOW No, no, there are not so many now. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Clov! END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Do you not think this has gone on long enough? END
BEGIN NOW Yes! END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW This... this... thing. END
BEGIN NOW I've always thought so. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW You not? END
BEGIN NOW Then it's a day like any other day. END
BEGIN NOW As long as it lasts. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW All life long the same inanities. END
BEGIN NOW I can't leave you. END
BEGIN NOW I know. END
BEGIN NOW And you can't follow me. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW If you leave me how shall I know? END
BEGIN NOW Well you simply whistle me and if I don't come running it means I've left you. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW You won't come and kiss me goodbye? END
BEGIN NOW Oh I shouldn't think so. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW But you might be merely dead in your kitchen. END
BEGIN NOW The result would be the same. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, but how would I know, if you were merely dead in your kitchen? END
BEGIN NOW Well... sooner or later I'd start to stink. END
BEGIN NOW You stink already. END
BEGIN NOW The whole place stinks of corpses. END
BEGIN NOW The whole universe. END
BEGIN NOW To hell with the universe. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Think of something. END
BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW An idea, have an idea. END
BEGIN NOW (Angrily.) END
BEGIN NOW A bright idea! END
BEGIN NOW Ah good. END
BEGIN NOW (He starts pacing to and fro, his eyes fixed on the ground, his hands behind his back. END
BEGIN NOW He halts.) END
BEGIN NOW The pains in my legs! END
BEGIN NOW It's unbelievable! END
BEGIN NOW Soon I won't be able to think any more. END
BEGIN NOW You won't be able to leave me. END
BEGIN NOW (Clov resumes his pacing.) END
BEGIN NOW What are you doing? END
BEGIN NOW Having an idea. END
BEGIN NOW (He paces.) END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW (He halts.) END
BEGIN NOW What a brain! END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Well? END
BEGIN NOW Wait! END
BEGIN NOW (He meditates. END
BEGIN NOW Not very convinced.) END
BEGIN NOW Yes... (He raises his head.) END
BEGIN NOW I have it! END
BEGIN NOW I set the alarm. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW This is perhaps not one of my bright days, but frankly— You whistle me. END
BEGIN NOW I don't come. END
BEGIN NOW The alarm rings. END
BEGIN NOW I'm gone. END
BEGIN NOW It doesn't ring. END
BEGIN NOW I'm dead. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Is it working? END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Impatiently.) END
BEGIN NOW The alarm, is it working? END
BEGIN NOW Why wouldn't it be working? END
BEGIN NOW Because it's worked too much. END
BEGIN NOW But it's hardly worked at all. END
BEGIN NOW Then because it's worked too little! END
BEGIN NOW I'll go and see. END
BEGIN NOW (Exit Clov. END
BEGIN NOW Brief ring of alarm offstage. END
BEGIN NOW Enter Clov with alarm-clock. END
BEGIN NOW He holds it against Hamm's ear and releases alarm. END
BEGIN NOW They listen to it ringing to the end. END
BEGIN NOW Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Fit to wake the dead! END
BEGIN NOW Did you hear it? END
BEGIN NOW Vaguely. END
BEGIN NOW The end is terrific! END
BEGIN NOW I prefer the middle. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Is is not time for my pain-killer? END
BEGIN NOW No! END
BEGIN NOW (He goes to door, turns.) END
BEGIN NOW I'll leave you. END
BEGIN NOW It's time for my story. END
BEGIN NOW Do you want to listen to my story? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW Ask my father if he wants to listen to my story. END
BEGIN NOW (Clov goes to bins, raises the lid of Nagg's, stoops, looks into it. END
BEGIN NOW Pause. END
BEGIN NOW He straightens up.) END
BEGIN NOW He's asleep. END
BEGIN NOW Wake him. END
BEGIN NOW (Clov stoops, wakes Nagg with the alarm. END
BEGIN NOW Unintelligible words. END
BEGIN NOW Clov straightens up.) END
BEGIN NOW He doesn't want to listen to your story. END
BEGIN NOW I'll give him a bon-bon. END
BEGIN NOW (Clov stoops. END
BEGIN NOW As before.) END
BEGIN NOW He wants a sugar-plum. END
BEGIN NOW He'll get a sugar-plum. END
BEGIN NOW (Clov stoops. END
BEGIN NOW As before.) END
BEGIN NOW It's a deal. END
BEGIN NOW (He goes towards door. END
BEGIN NOW Nagg's hands appear, gripping the rim. END
BEGIN NOW Then the head emerges. END
BEGIN NOW Clov reaches door, turns.) END
BEGIN NOW Do you believe in the life to come? END
BEGIN NOW Mine was always that. END
BEGIN NOW (Exit Clov.) END
BEGIN NOW Got him that time! END
BEGIN NOW I'm listening. END
BEGIN NOW Scoundrel! END
BEGIN NOW Why did you engender me? END
BEGIN NOW I didn't know. END
BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW What didn't you know? END
BEGIN NOW That it'd be you. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW You'll give me a sugar-plum? END
BEGIN NOW After the audition. END
BEGIN NOW You swear? END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW On what? END
BEGIN NOW My honor. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW They laugh heartily.) END
BEGIN NOW Two. END
BEGIN NOW One. END
BEGIN NOW One for me and one for— One! END
BEGIN NOW Silence! END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Where was I? END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Gloomily.) END
BEGIN NOW It's finished, we're finished. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Nearly finished. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW There'll be no more speech. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Something dripping in my head, ever since the fontanelles. END
BEGIN NOW (Stifled hilarity of Nagg.) END
BEGIN NOW Splash, splash, always on the same spot. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps it's a little vein. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW A little artery. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW More animated.) END
BEGIN NOW Enough of that, it's story time, where was I? END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Narrative tone.) END
BEGIN NOW The man came crawling towards me, on his belly. END
BEGIN NOW Pale, wonderfully pale and thin, he seemed on the point of— (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Normal tone.) END
BEGIN NOW No, I've done that bit. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Narrative tone.) END
BEGIN NOW I calmly filled my pipe—the meerschaum, lit it with... let us say a vesta, drew a few puffs. END
BEGIN NOW Aah! END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Well, what is it you want? END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW It was an extra-ordinarily bitter day, I remember, zero by the thermometer. END
BEGIN NOW But considering it was Christmas Eve there was nothing... extra-ordinary about that. END
BEGIN NOW Seasonable weather, for once in a way. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Well, what ill wind blows you my way? END
BEGIN NOW He raised his face to me, black with mingled dirt and tears. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Normal tone.) END
BEGIN NOW That should do it. END
BEGIN NOW (Narrative tone.) END
BEGIN NOW No no, don't look at me, don't look at me. END
BEGIN NOW He dropped his eyes and mumbled something, apologies I presume. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW I'm a busy man, you know, the final touches, before the festivities, you know what it is. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Forcibly.) END
BEGIN NOW Come on now, what is the object of this invasion? END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW It was a glorious bright day, I remember, fifty by the heliometer, but already the sun was sinking down into the... down among the dead. END
BEGIN NOW (Normal voice.) END
BEGIN NOW Nicely put, that. END
BEGIN NOW (Narrative tone.) END
BEGIN NOW Come on now, come on, present your petition and let me resume my labors. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Normal tone.) END
BEGIN NOW There's English for you. END
BEGIN NOW Ah well... (Narrative tone.) END
BEGIN NOW It was then he took the plunge. END
BEGIN NOW It's my little one, he said. END
BEGIN NOW Tsstss, a little one, that's bad. END
BEGIN NOW My little boy, he said, as if the sex mattered. END
BEGIN NOW Where did he come from? END
BEGIN NOW He named the hole. END
BEGIN NOW A good half-day, on horse. END
BEGIN NOW What are you insinuating? END
BEGIN NOW That the place is still inhabited? END
BEGIN NOW No no, not a soul, except himself and the child—assuming he existed. END
BEGIN NOW Good. END
BEGIN NOW I enquired about the situation at Kov, beyond the gulf. END
BEGIN NOW Not a sinner. END
BEGIN NOW Good. END
BEGIN NOW And you expect me to believe you have left your little one back there, all alone, and alive into the bargain? END
BEGIN NOW Come now! END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW It was a howling day, I remember, a hundred by the anenometer. END
BEGIN NOW The wind was tearing up the dead pines and sweeping them... away. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Normal tone.) END
BEGIN NOW A feeble bit, that. END
BEGIN NOW (Narrative tone.) END
BEGIN NOW Come on, man, speak up, what is it you want from me, I have to put up my holly. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Well to make it short it finally transpired that what he wanted from me was... bread for his brat? END
BEGIN NOW Bread? END
BEGIN NOW But I have no bread, it doesn't agree with me. END
BEGIN NOW Good. END
BEGIN NOW Then perhaps a little corn? END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Normal tone.) END
BEGIN NOW That should do it. END
BEGIN NOW (Narrative tone.) END
BEGIN NOW yes, I have corn, it's true, in my granaries. END
BEGIN NOW But use your head. END
BEGIN NOW I give you some corn, a pound, a pound and a half, you bring it back to your child and you make him—if he's still alive—a nice pot of porridge. END
BEGIN NOW (Nagg reacts.) END
BEGIN NOW a nice pot and a half of porridge, full of nourishment. END
BEGIN NOW Good. END
BEGIN NOW The colors come back into his little cheeks—perhaps. END
BEGIN NOW And then? END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW I lost patience. END
BEGIN NOW (Violently.) END
BEGIN NOW Use your head, can't you, use your head. END
BEGIN NOW You're on earth, there's no cure for that! END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW It was an exceedingly dry day, I remember, zero by the hygrometer. END
BEGIN NOW Ideal weather, for my lumbago. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Violently.) END
BEGIN NOW But what in God's name do you imagine? END
BEGIN NOW That the earth will awake in the spring? END
BEGIN NOW That the rivers and seas will run with fish again? END
BEGIN NOW That there's manna in heaven still for imbeciles like you? END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Gradually I cooled down, sufficiently at least to ask him how long he had taken on the way. END
BEGIN NOW Three whole days. END
BEGIN NOW Good. END
BEGIN NOW In what condition he had left the child. END
BEGIN NOW Deep in sleep. END
BEGIN NOW (Forcibly.) END
BEGIN NOW But deep in what sleep, deep in what sleep already? END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Well to make it short I finally offered to take him into my service. END
BEGIN NOW He had touched a chord. END
BEGIN NOW And then I imagined already that I wasn't much longer for this world. END
BEGIN NOW (He laughs. END
BEGIN NOW Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Well? END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Well? END
BEGIN NOW Here if you were careful you might die a nice natural death, in peace and comfort. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Well? END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW In the end he asked me would I consent to take in the child as well—if he were still alive. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW It was the moment I was waiting for. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Would I consent to take in the child... END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW I can see him still, down on his knees, his hands flat on the ground, glaring at me with his mad eyes, in defiance of my wishes. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Normal tone.) END
BEGIN NOW I'll soon have finished with this story. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Unless I bring in other characters. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW But where would I find them? END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Where would I look for them? END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW He whistles. END
BEGIN NOW Enter Clov.) END
BEGIN NOW Let us pray to God. END
BEGIN NOW Me sugar-plum! END
BEGIN NOW There's a rat in the kitchen! END
BEGIN NOW A rat! END
BEGIN NOW Are there still rats? END
BEGIN NOW In the kitchen there's one. END
BEGIN NOW And you haven't exterminated him? END
BEGIN NOW Half. END
BEGIN NOW You disturbed us. END
BEGIN NOW He can't get away? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW You'll finish him later. END
BEGIN NOW Let us pray to God. END
BEGIN NOW Again! END
BEGIN NOW Me sugar-plum! END
BEGIN NOW God first! END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Are you right? END
BEGIN NOW Off we go. END
BEGIN NOW And you? END
BEGIN NOW NAGG (clasping his hands, closing his eyes, in a gabble): Our Father which art— Silence! END
BEGIN NOW In silence! END
BEGIN NOW Where are your manners? END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Off we go. END
BEGIN NOW (Attitudes of prayer. END
BEGIN NOW Silence. END
BEGIN NOW Abandoning his attitude, discouraged.) END
BEGIN NOW Well? END
BEGIN NOW What a hope! END
BEGIN NOW And you? END
BEGIN NOW Sweet damn all! END
BEGIN NOW (To Nagg.) END
BEGIN NOW And you? END
BEGIN NOW Wait! END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Abandoning his attitude.) END
BEGIN NOW Nothing doing! END
BEGIN NOW The bastard!! END
BEGIN NOW He doesn't exist. END
BEGIN NOW Not yet. END
BEGIN NOW Me sugar-plum! END
BEGIN NOW There are no more sugar plums! END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW It's natural. END
BEGIN NOW After all I'm your father. END
BEGIN NOW It's true if it hadn't been me it would have been someone else. END
BEGIN NOW But that's no excuse. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Turkish Delight, for example, which no longer exists, we all know that, there is nothing in the world I love more. END
BEGIN NOW And one day I'll ask you for some, in return for a kindness, and you'll promise it to me. END
BEGIN NOW One must live with the times. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Whom did you call when you were a tiny boy, and were frightened, in the dark? END
BEGIN NOW Your mother? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW Me. END
BEGIN NOW We let you cry. END
BEGIN NOW Then we moved you out of earshot, so that we might sleep in peace. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW I was asleep, as happy as a king, and you woke me up to have me listen to you. END
BEGIN NOW It wasn't indispensable, you didn't really need to have me listen to you. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW I hope the day will come when you'll really need to have me listen to you, and need to hear my voice, any voice. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Yes, I hope I'll live till then, to hear you calling me like when you were a tiny boy, and were frightened, in the dark, and I was your only hope. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Nagg knocks on lid of Nell's bin. END
BEGIN NOW Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Nell! END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW He knocks louder. END
BEGIN NOW Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Louder.) END
BEGIN NOW Nell! END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Nagg sinks back into his bin, closes the lid behind him. END
BEGIN NOW Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Our revels now are ended. END
BEGIN NOW (He gropes for the dog.) END
BEGIN NOW The dog's gone. END
BEGIN NOW He's not a real dog, he can't go. END
BEGIN NOW He's not there. END
BEGIN NOW He's lain down. END
BEGIN NOW Give him up to me. END
BEGIN NOW (Clov picks up the dog and gives it to Hamm. END
BEGIN NOW Hamm holds it in his arms. END
BEGIN NOW Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Hamm throws away the dog.) END
BEGIN NOW Dirty brute! END
BEGIN NOW (Clov begins to pick up the objects lying on the ground.) END
BEGIN NOW What are you doing? END
BEGIN NOW Putting things in order. END
BEGIN NOW (He straightens up. END
BEGIN NOW Fervently.) END
BEGIN NOW I'm going to clear everything away! END
BEGIN NOW (He starts picking up again.) END
BEGIN NOW Order! END
BEGIN NOW I love order. END
BEGIN NOW It's my dream. END
BEGIN NOW A world where all would be silent and still, and each thing in its last place, under the last dust. END
BEGIN NOW (He starts picking up again.) END
BEGIN NOW What in God's name do you think you're doing? END
BEGIN NOW I'm doing my best to create a little order. END
BEGIN NOW Drop it! END
BEGIN NOW (Clov drops the objects he has picked up.) END
BEGIN NOW After all, there or elsewhere. END
BEGIN NOW (He goes towards door.) END
BEGIN NOW What's wrong with your feet? END
BEGIN NOW My feet? END
BEGIN NOW Tramp! END
BEGIN NOW Tramp! END
BEGIN NOW I must have put on my boots. END
BEGIN NOW Your slippers were hurting you? END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW I'll leave you. END
BEGIN NOW No! END
BEGIN NOW What is there to keep me here? END
BEGIN NOW The dialogue. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW I've got on with my story. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW I've got on with it well. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Irritably.) END
BEGIN NOW Ask me where I've got to. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, by the way, your story? END
BEGIN NOW What story? END
BEGIN NOW The one you've been telling yourself all your days. END
BEGIN NOW Ah you mean my chronicle? END
BEGIN NOW That's the one. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Keep going, can't you, keep going! END
BEGIN NOW You've got on with it, I hope. END
BEGIN NOW Oh not very far, not very far. END
BEGIN NOW (He sighs.) END
BEGIN NOW There are days like that, one isn't inspired. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Nothing you can do about it, just wait for it to come. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW No forcing, no forcing, it's fatal. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW I've got on with it a little all the same. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Technique, you know. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Irritably.) END
BEGIN NOW I say I've got on with it a little all the same. END
BEGIN NOW Well I never! END
BEGIN NOW In spite of everything you were able to get on with it! END
BEGIN NOW Oh not very far, you know, not very far, but nevertheless, better than nothing. END
BEGIN NOW Better than nothing! END
BEGIN NOW Is it possible? END
BEGIN NOW I'll tell you how it goes. END
BEGIN NOW He comes crawling on his belly— Who? END
BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW Who do you mean, he? END
BEGIN NOW Who do I mean! END
BEGIN NOW Yet another. END
BEGIN NOW Ah him. END
BEGIN NOW I wasn't sure. END
BEGIN NOW Crawling on his belly, whining for bread for his brat. END
BEGIN NOW He's offered a job as gardener. END
BEGIN NOW Before— (Clov bursts out laughing.) END
BEGIN NOW What is there so funny about that? END
BEGIN NOW A job as gardener! END
BEGIN NOW Is that what tickles you? END
BEGIN NOW It must be that. END
BEGIN NOW It wouldn't be the bread? END
BEGIN NOW Or the brat. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW The whole thing is comical, I grant you that. END
BEGIN NOW What about having a good guffaw, the two of us together? END
BEGIN NOW I couldn't guffaw again today. END
BEGIN NOW Nor I. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW I continue then. END
BEGIN NOW Before accepting with gratitude he asks if he may have his little boy with him. END
BEGIN NOW What age? END
BEGIN NOW Oh tiny. END
BEGIN NOW He would have climbed the trees. END
BEGIN NOW All the little odd jobs. END
BEGIN NOW And then he would have grown up. END
BEGIN NOW Very likely. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Keep going, can't you, keep going? END
BEGIN NOW That's all. END
BEGIN NOW I stopped there. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Do you see how it goes on? END
BEGIN NOW More or less. END
BEGIN NOW Will it not soon be the end? END
BEGIN NOW I'm afraid it will. END
BEGIN NOW Pah! END
BEGIN NOW You'll make up another. END
BEGIN NOW I don't know. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW I feel rather drained. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW The prolonged creative effort. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW If I could drag myself down to the sea! END
BEGIN NOW I'd make a pillow of sand for my head and the tide would come. END
BEGIN NOW There's no more tide. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Go and see is she dead. END
BEGIN NOW (Clov goes to bins, raises the lid of Nell's, stoops, looks into it. END
BEGIN NOW Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Looks like it. END
BEGIN NOW (He closes the lid, straightens up. END
BEGIN NOW Hamm raises his toque. END
BEGIN NOW Pause. END
BEGIN NOW He puts it on again.) END
BEGIN NOW And Nagg? END
BEGIN NOW (Clov raises lid of Nagg's bin, stoops, looks into it. END
BEGIN NOW Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Doesn't look like it. END
BEGIN NOW (He closes the lid, straightens up.) END
BEGIN NOW What's he doing? END
BEGIN NOW (Clov raises lid of Nagg's bin, stoops, looks into it. END
BEGIN NOW Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW He's crying. END
BEGIN NOW (He closes lid, straightens up.) END
BEGIN NOW Then he's living. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Did you ever have an instant of happiness? END
BEGIN NOW Not to my knowledge. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Bring me under the window. END
BEGIN NOW (Clov goes towards chair.) END
BEGIN NOW I want to feel the light on my face. END
BEGIN NOW (Clov pushes chair.) END
BEGIN NOW Do you remember, in the beginning, when you took me for a turn? END
BEGIN NOW You used to hold the chair too high. END
BEGIN NOW At every step you nearly tipped me out. END
BEGIN NOW (With senile quaver.) END
BEGIN NOW Ah great fun, we had, the two of us, great fun. END
BEGIN NOW (Gloomily.) END
BEGIN NOW And then we got into the way of it. END
BEGIN NOW (Clov stops the chair under window right.) END
BEGIN NOW There already? END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW He tilts back his head.) END
BEGIN NOW Is it light? END
BEGIN NOW It isn't dark. END
BEGIN NOW I'm asking you is it light? END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW The curtain isn't closed? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW What window is it? END
BEGIN NOW The earth. END
BEGIN NOW I knew it! END
BEGIN NOW (Angrily.) END
BEGIN NOW But there's no light there! END
BEGIN NOW The other! END
BEGIN NOW (Clov pushes chair towards window left.) END
BEGIN NOW The earth! END
BEGIN NOW (Clov stops the chair under window left. END
BEGIN NOW Hamm tilts back his head.) END
BEGIN NOW That's what I call light! END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Feels like a ray of sunshine. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW No? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW It isn't a ray of sunshine I feel on my face? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Am I very white? END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Angrily.) END
BEGIN NOW I'm asking you am I very white? END
BEGIN NOW Not more so than usual. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Open the window. END
BEGIN NOW What for? END
BEGIN NOW I want to hear the sea. END
BEGIN NOW You wouldn't hear it. END
BEGIN NOW Even if you opened the window? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW Than it's not worth while opening it? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW Than open it! END
BEGIN NOW (Clov gets up on the ladder, opens the window. END
BEGIN NOW Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Have you opened it? END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW You swear you've opened it? END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Well...! END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW It must be very calm. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Violently.) END
BEGIN NOW I'm asking you is it very calm! END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW It's because there are no more navigators. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW You haven't much conversation all of a sudden. END
BEGIN NOW Do you not feel well? END
BEGIN NOW I'm cold. END
BEGIN NOW What month are we? END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Close the window, we're going back. END
BEGIN NOW (Clov closes the window, gets down, pushes the chair back to its place, remains standing behind it, head bowed.) END
BEGIN NOW Don't stand there, you give me the shivers! END
BEGIN NOW (Clov returns to his place beside the chair.) END
BEGIN NOW Father! END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Louder.) END
BEGIN NOW Father! END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Go and see did he hear me. END
BEGIN NOW (Clov goes to Nagg's bin, raises the lid, stoops. END
BEGIN NOW Unintelligible words. END
BEGIN NOW Clov straightens up.) END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Both times? END
BEGIN NOW (Clov stoops. END
BEGIN NOW As before.) END
BEGIN NOW Once only. END
BEGIN NOW The first time or the second? END
BEGIN NOW (Clov stoops. END
BEGIN NOW As before.) END
BEGIN NOW He doesn't know. END
BEGIN NOW It must have been the second. END
BEGIN NOW We'll never know. END
BEGIN NOW (He closes lid.) END
BEGIN NOW Is he still crying? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW The dead go fast. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW What's he doing? END
BEGIN NOW Sucking his biscuit. END
BEGIN NOW Life goes on. END
BEGIN NOW (Clov returns to his place beside the chair.) END
BEGIN NOW Give me the rug, I'm freezing. END
BEGIN NOW There are no more rugs. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Kiss me. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Will you not kiss me? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW On the forehead. END
BEGIN NOW I won't kiss you anywhere. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Give me your hand at least. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Will you not give me your hand? END
BEGIN NOW I won't touch you. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Give me the dog. END
BEGIN NOW (Clov looks round for the dog.) END
BEGIN NOW No! END
BEGIN NOW Do you not want your dog? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW Then I'll leave you. END
BEGIN NOW HAMM (head bowed, absently): That's right. END
BEGIN NOW (Clov goes to door, turns.) END
BEGIN NOW If I don't kill that rat he'll die. END
BEGIN NOW That's right. END
BEGIN NOW (Exit Clov. END
BEGIN NOW Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Me to play. END
BEGIN NOW (He takes out his handkerchief, unfolds it, holds it spread out before him.) END
BEGIN NOW We're getting on. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW You weep, and weep, for nothing, so as not to laugh, and little by little... you begin to grieve. END
BEGIN NOW (He folds the handkerchief, puts it back in his pocket, raises his head.) END
BEGIN NOW All those I might have helped. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Helped! END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Saved. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Saved! END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW The place was crawling with them (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Violently.) END
BEGIN NOW Use your head, can't you, use your head, you're on earth, there's no cure for that! END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Get out of here and love one another! END
BEGIN NOW Lick your neighbor as yourself! END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Calmer.) END
BEGIN NOW When it wasn't bread they wanted it was crumpets. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Violently.) END
BEGIN NOW Out of my sight and back to your petting parties! END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW All that, all that! END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Not even a real dog! END
BEGIN NOW (Calmer.) END
BEGIN NOW The end is in the beginning and yet you go on. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps I could go on with my story, end it and begin another. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps I could throw myself out on the floor. END
BEGIN NOW (He pushes himself painfully off his seat, falls back again.) END
BEGIN NOW Dig my nails into the cracks and drag myself forward with my fingers. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW It will be the end and there I'll be, wondering what can have brought it on and wondering what can have... (he hesitates)\...why it was so long coming. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW There I'll be, in the old shelter, alone against the silence and... (he hesitates)\...the stillness. END
BEGIN NOW If I can hold my peace, and sit quiet, it will be all over with sound, and motion, all over and done with. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW I'll have called my father and I'll have called my... (he hesitates)\...my son. END
BEGIN NOW And even twice, or three times, in case they shouldn't have heard me, the first time, or the second. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW I'll say to myself, He'll come back. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW And then? END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW And then? END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW He couldn't, He has gone too far. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW And then? END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Very agitated.) END
BEGIN NOW All kinds of fantasies! END
BEGIN NOW That I'm being watched! END
BEGIN NOW A rat! END
BEGIN NOW Steps! END
BEGIN NOW Breath held and then... (He breathes out.) END
BEGIN NOW Then babble, babble, words, like the solitary child who turns himself into children, two, three, so as to be together, and whisper together, in the dark. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Moment upon moment, pattering down, like the millet grains of... (he hesitates)\...that old Greek, and all life long you wait for that to mount up to a life. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW He opens his mouth to continue, renounces.) END
BEGIN NOW Ah let's get it over! END
BEGIN NOW (He whistles. END
BEGIN NOW Enter Clov with alarm-clock. END
BEGIN NOW He halts beside the chair.) END
BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW Neither gone nor dead? END
BEGIN NOW In spirit only. END
BEGIN NOW Which? END
BEGIN NOW Both. END
BEGIN NOW Gone from me you'd be dead. END
BEGIN NOW And vice versa. END
BEGIN NOW Outside of here it's death! END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW And the rat? END
BEGIN NOW He's got away. END
BEGIN NOW He can't go far. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Anxious.) END
BEGIN NOW Eh? END
BEGIN NOW He doesn't need to go far. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Is it not time for my pain-killer? END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW At last! END
BEGIN NOW Give it to me! END
BEGIN NOW Quick! END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW There's no more pain-killer. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Good...! END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW No more pain-killer! END
BEGIN NOW No more pain-killer. END
BEGIN NOW You'll never get any more pain-killer. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW But the little round box. END
BEGIN NOW It was full! END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW But now it's empty. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Clov starts to move about the room. END
BEGIN NOW He is looking for a place to put down the alarm-clock.) END
BEGIN NOW What'll I do? END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW In a scream.) END
BEGIN NOW What'll I do? END
BEGIN NOW (Clov sees the picture, takes it down, stands it on the floor with its face to the wall, hangs up the alarm-clock in its place.) END
BEGIN NOW What are you doing? END
BEGIN NOW Winding up. END
BEGIN NOW Look at the earth. END
BEGIN NOW Again! END
BEGIN NOW Since it's calling to you. END
BEGIN NOW Is your throat sore? END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Would you like a lozenge? END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Pity. END
BEGIN NOW (Clov goes, humming, towards window right, halts before it, looks up at it.) END
BEGIN NOW Don't sing. END
BEGIN NOW One hasn't the right to sing any more? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW Then how can it end? END
BEGIN NOW You want it to end? END
BEGIN NOW I want to sing. END
BEGIN NOW I can't prevent you. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Clov turns towards window right.) END
BEGIN NOW What did I do with that steps? END
BEGIN NOW (He looks around for ladder.) END
BEGIN NOW You didn't see that steps? END
BEGIN NOW (He sees it.) END
BEGIN NOW Ah, about time. END
BEGIN NOW (He goes towards window left.) END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes I wonder if I'm in my right mind. END
BEGIN NOW Then it passes over and I'm as lucid as before. END
BEGIN NOW (He gets up on ladder, looks out of window.) END
BEGIN NOW Christ, she's under water! END
BEGIN NOW (He looks.) END
BEGIN NOW How can that be? END
BEGIN NOW (He pokes forward his head, his hand above his eyes.) END
BEGIN NOW It hasn't rained. END
BEGIN NOW (He wipes the pane, looks. END
BEGIN NOW Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Ah what a fool I am! END
BEGIN NOW I'm on the wrong side! END
BEGIN NOW (He gets down, takes a few steps towards window right.) END
BEGIN NOW Under water! END
BEGIN NOW (He goes back for ladder.) END
BEGIN NOW What a fool I am! END
BEGIN NOW (He carries ladder towards window right.) END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes I wonder if I'm in my right senses. END
BEGIN NOW Then it passes off and I'm as intelligent as ever. END
BEGIN NOW (He sets down ladder under window right, gets up on it, looks out of window. END
BEGIN NOW He turns towards Hamm.) END
BEGIN NOW Any particular sector you fancy? END
BEGIN NOW Or merely the whole thing? END
BEGIN NOW Whole thing. END
BEGIN NOW The general effect? END
BEGIN NOW Just a moment. END
BEGIN NOW (He looks out of window. END
BEGIN NOW Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Clov. END
BEGIN NOW Mmm. END
BEGIN NOW Do you know what it is? END
BEGIN NOW Mmm. END
BEGIN NOW I was never there. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Clov! END
BEGIN NOW CLOV (turning towards Hamm, exasperated): What is it? END
BEGIN NOW I was never there. END
BEGIN NOW Lucky for you. END
BEGIN NOW (He looks out of window.) END
BEGIN NOW Absent, always. END
BEGIN NOW It all happened without me. END
BEGIN NOW I don't know what's happened. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Do you know what's happened? END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Clov! END
BEGIN NOW CLOV (turning towards Hamm, exasperated): Do you want me to look at this muckheap, yes or no? END
BEGIN NOW Answer me first. END
BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW Do you know what's happened? END
BEGIN NOW When? END
BEGIN NOW Where? END
BEGIN NOW When! END
BEGIN NOW What's happened? END
BEGIN NOW Use your head, can't you! END
BEGIN NOW What has happened? END
BEGIN NOW What for Christ's sake does it matter? END
BEGIN NOW (He looks out of window.) END
BEGIN NOW I don't know. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Clov turns towards Hamm.) END
BEGIN NOW When old Mother Pegg asked you for oil for her lamp and you told her to get out to hell, you knew what was happening then, no? END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW You know what she died of, Mother Pegg? END
BEGIN NOW Of darkness. END
BEGIN NOW I hadn't any. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, you had. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Have you the glass? END
BEGIN NOW No, it's clear enough as it is. END
BEGIN NOW Go and get it. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Clov casts up his eyes, brandishes his fists. END
BEGIN NOW He loses balance, clutches on to the ladder. END
BEGIN NOW He starts to get down, halts.) END
BEGIN NOW There's one thing I'll never understand. END
BEGIN NOW (He gets down.) END
BEGIN NOW Why I always obey you. END
BEGIN NOW Can you explain that to me? END
BEGIN NOW No... Perhaps it's compassion. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW A kind of great compassion. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Oh you won't find it easy, you won't find it easy. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Clov begins to move about the room in search of the telescope.) END
BEGIN NOW I'm tired of our goings on, very tired. END
BEGIN NOW (He searches.) END
BEGIN NOW You're not sitting on it? END
BEGIN NOW (He moves the chair, looks at the place where it stood, resumes his search.) END
BEGIN NOW Don't leave me there! END
BEGIN NOW (Angrily Clov restores the chair to its place.) END
BEGIN NOW Am I right in the center? END
BEGIN NOW You'd need a microscope to find this— (He sees the telescope.) END
BEGIN NOW Ah, about time. END
BEGIN NOW (He picks up the telescope, gets up on the ladder, turns the telescope on the without.) END
BEGIN NOW Give me the dog. END
BEGIN NOW Quiet! END
BEGIN NOW Give me the dog! END
BEGIN NOW (Clov drops the telescope, clasps his hands to his head. END
BEGIN NOW Pause. END
BEGIN NOW He gets down precipitately, looks for the dog, sees it, picks it up, hastens towards Hamm and strikes him violently on the head with the dog.) END
BEGIN NOW There's your dog for you. END
BEGIN NOW (The dog falls to the ground. END
BEGIN NOW Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW He hit me! END
BEGIN NOW You drive me mad, I'm mad! END
BEGIN NOW If you must hit me, hit me with the axe. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Or with the gaff, hit me with the gaff. END
BEGIN NOW Not with the dog. END
BEGIN NOW With the gaff. END
BEGIN NOW Or with the axe. END
BEGIN NOW (Clov picks up the dog and gives it to Hamm who takes it in his arms.) END
BEGIN NOW Let's stop playing! END
BEGIN NOW Never! END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Put me in my coffin. END
BEGIN NOW There are no more coffins. END
BEGIN NOW Then let it end! END
BEGIN NOW (Clov goes towards ladder.) END
BEGIN NOW With a bang! END
BEGIN NOW (Clov gets up on ladder, gets down again, looks for telescope, sees it, picks it up, gets up on ladder, raises telescope.) END
BEGIN NOW Of darkness! END
BEGIN NOW And me? END
BEGIN NOW Did anyone ever have pity on me? END
BEGIN NOW CLOV (lowering the telescope, turning towards Hamm): What? END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Is it me you're referring to? END
BEGIN NOW An aside, ape! END
BEGIN NOW Did you never hear an aside before? END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW I'm warming up for my last soliloquy. END
BEGIN NOW I warn you. END
BEGIN NOW I'm going to look at this filth since it's an order. END
BEGIN NOW But it's the last time. END
BEGIN NOW (He turns the telescope on the without.) END
BEGIN NOW Let's see. END
BEGIN NOW (He moves the telescope.) END
BEGIN NOW Nothing... nothing... good... good... nothing... goo— (He starts, lowers the telescope, examines it, turns it again on the without. END
BEGIN NOW Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Bad luck to it! END
BEGIN NOW More complications! END
BEGIN NOW (Clov gets down.) END
BEGIN NOW Not an underplot, I trust. END
BEGIN NOW (Clov moves ladder nearer window, gets up on it, turns telescope on the without.) END
BEGIN NOW Looks like a small boy! END
BEGIN NOW A small... boy! END
BEGIN NOW I'll go and see. END
BEGIN NOW (He gets down, drops the telescope, goes towards door, turns.) END
BEGIN NOW I'll take the gaff. END
BEGIN NOW (He looks for the gaff, sees it, picks it up, hastens towards door.) END
BEGIN NOW No! END
BEGIN NOW (Clov halts.) END
BEGIN NOW No? END
BEGIN NOW A potential procreator? END
BEGIN NOW If he exists he'll die there or he'll come here. END
BEGIN NOW And if he doesn't... END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW You don't believe me? END
BEGIN NOW You think I'm inventing? END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW It's the end, Clov, we've come to the end. END
BEGIN NOW I don't need you any more. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Lucky for you. END
BEGIN NOW (He goes towards door.) END
BEGIN NOW Leave me the gaff. END
BEGIN NOW (Clov gives him the gaff, goes towards door, halts, looks at alarm-clock, takes it down, looks round for a better place to put it, goes to bins, puts it on lid of Nagg's bin. END
BEGIN NOW Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW I'll leave you. END
BEGIN NOW (He goes towards door.) END
BEGIN NOW Before you go... (Clov halts near door. END
BEGIN NOW )\...say something. END
BEGIN NOW There is nothing to say. END
BEGIN NOW A few words... to ponder... in my heart. END
BEGIN NOW Your heart! END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Forcibly.) END
BEGIN NOW Yes! END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW With the rest, in the end, the shadows, the murmurs, all the trouble, to end up with. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Clov... END
BEGIN NOW He never spoke to me. END
BEGIN NOW Then, in the end, before he went, without my having asked him, he spoke to me. END
BEGIN NOW He said... Ah...! END
BEGIN NOW Something... from your heart. END
BEGIN NOW My heart! END
BEGIN NOW A few words... from your heart. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW CLOV (fixed gaze, tonelessly, towards auditorium): They said to me, That's love, yes, yes, not a doubt, now you see how— Articulate! END
BEGIN NOW How easy it is. END
BEGIN NOW They said to me, That's friendship, yes, yes, no question, you've found it. END
BEGIN NOW They said to me, Here's the place, stop, raise your head and look at all that beauty. END
BEGIN NOW That order! END
BEGIN NOW They said to me, Come now, you're not a brute beast, think upon these things and you'll see how all becomes clear. END
BEGIN NOW And simple! END
BEGIN NOW They said to me, What skilled attention they get, all these dying of their wounds. END
BEGIN NOW Enough! END
BEGIN NOW I say to myself— sometimes, Clov, you must learn to suffer better than that if you want them to weary of punishing you— one day. END
BEGIN NOW I say to myself—sometimes, Clov, you must be better than that if you want them to let you go—one day. END
BEGIN NOW But I feel too old, and too far, to form new habits. END
BEGIN NOW Good, it'll never end, I'll never go. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Then one day, suddenly, it ends, it changes, I don't understand, it dies, or it's me, I don't understand that either. END
BEGIN NOW I ask the words that remain— sleeping, waking, morning, evening. END
BEGIN NOW They have nothing to say. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW I open the door of the cell and go. END
BEGIN NOW I am so bowed I only see my feet, if I open my eyes, and between my legs a little trail of black dust. END
BEGIN NOW I say to myself that the earth is extinguished, though I never saw it lit. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW It's easy going. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW When I fall I'll weep for happiness. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW He goes towards door.) END
BEGIN NOW Clov! END
BEGIN NOW (Clov halts, without turning.) END
BEGIN NOW Nothing. END
BEGIN NOW (Clov moves on.) END
BEGIN NOW Clov! END
BEGIN NOW (Clov halts, without turning.) END
BEGIN NOW This is what we call making an exit. END
BEGIN NOW I'm obliged to you, Clov. END
BEGIN NOW For your services. END
BEGIN NOW Ah pardon, it's I am obliged to you. END
BEGIN NOW It's we are obliged to each other. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Clov goes towards door.) END
BEGIN NOW One thing more. END
BEGIN NOW (Clov halts.) END
BEGIN NOW A last favor. END
BEGIN NOW (Exit Clov.) END
BEGIN NOW Cover me with the sheet. END
BEGIN NOW (Long pause.) END
BEGIN NOW No? END
BEGIN NOW Good. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Me to play. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Wearily.) END
BEGIN NOW Old endgame lost of old, play and lose and have done with losing. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW More animated.) END
BEGIN NOW Let me see. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Ah yes! END
BEGIN NOW (He tries to move the chair, using the gaff as before. END
BEGIN NOW Enter Clov, dressed for the road. END
BEGIN NOW Panama hat, tweed coat, raincoat over his arm, umbrella, bag. END
BEGIN NOW He halts by the door and stands there, impassive and motionless, his eyes fixed on Hamm, till the end.) END
BEGIN NOW Hamm gives up: Good. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Discard. END
BEGIN NOW (He throws away the gaff, makes to throw away the dog, thinks better of it.) END
BEGIN NOW Take it easy. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW And now? END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Raise hat. END
BEGIN NOW (He raises his toque.) END
BEGIN NOW Peace to our... arses. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW And put on again. END
BEGIN NOW (He puts on his toque.) END
BEGIN NOW Deuce. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW He takes off his glasses.) END
BEGIN NOW Wipe. END
BEGIN NOW (He takes out his handkerchief and, without unfolding it, wipes his glasses.) END
BEGIN NOW And put on again. END
BEGIN NOW (He puts on his glasses, puts back the handkerchief in his pocket.) END
BEGIN NOW We're coming. END
BEGIN NOW A few more squirms like that and I'll call. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW A little poetry. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW You prayed— (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW He corrects himself.) END
BEGIN NOW You CRIED for night; it comes— (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW He corrects himself.) END
BEGIN NOW It FALLS: now cry in darkness. END
BEGIN NOW (He repeats, chanting.) END
BEGIN NOW You cried for night; it falls: now cry in darkness. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Nicely put, that. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW And now? END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Moments for nothing, now as always, time was never and time is over, reckoning closed and story ended. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Narrative tone.) END
BEGIN NOW If he could have his child with him... END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW It was the moment I was waiting for. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW You don't want to abandon him? END
BEGIN NOW You want him to bloom while you are withering? END
BEGIN NOW Be there to solace your last million last moments? END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW He doesn't realize, all he knows is hunger, and cold, and death to crown it all. END
BEGIN NOW But you! END
BEGIN NOW You ought to know what the earth is like, nowadays. END
BEGIN NOW Oh I put him before his responsibilities! END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Normal tone.) END
BEGIN NOW Well, there we are, there I am, that's enough. END
BEGIN NOW (He raises the whistle to his lips, hesitates, drops it. END
BEGIN NOW Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Yes, truly! END
BEGIN NOW (He whistles. END
BEGIN NOW Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Louder. END
BEGIN NOW Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Good. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Father! END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW Louder.) END
BEGIN NOW Father! END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Good. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW We're coming. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW And to end up with? END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW Discard. END
BEGIN NOW (He throws away the dog. END
BEGIN NOW He tears the whistle from his neck.) END
BEGIN NOW With my compliments. END
BEGIN NOW (He throws the whistle towards the auditorium. END
BEGIN NOW Pause. END
BEGIN NOW He sniffs. END
BEGIN NOW Soft.) END
BEGIN NOW Clov! END
BEGIN NOW (Long pause.) END
BEGIN NOW No? END
BEGIN NOW Good. END
BEGIN NOW (He takes out the handkerchief.) END
BEGIN NOW Since that's the way we're playing it... (he unfolds handkerchief)\...let's play it that way... (he unfolds)\...and speak no more about it... (he finishes unfolding)\...speak no more. END
BEGIN NOW (He holds handkerchief spread out before him.) END
BEGIN NOW Old stancher! END
BEGIN NOW (Pause.) END
BEGIN NOW You... remain. END
BEGIN NOW (Pause. END
BEGIN NOW He covers his face with handkerchief, lowers his arms to armrests, remains motionless.) END
BEGIN NOW (Brief tableau.) END
BEGIN NOW Well, there was once a very rich gentleman, and he'd three darters. END
BEGIN NOW And he thought to see how fond they was of him. END
BEGIN NOW So he says to the first, How much do you love me, my dear? END
BEGIN NOW Why, says she, as I love my life. END
BEGIN NOW That's good, says he. END
BEGIN NOW So he says to the second, How much do you love me, my dear? END
BEGIN NOW Why, says she, better nor all the world. END
BEGIN NOW That's good, says he. END
BEGIN NOW So he says to the third, How much do you love me, my dear? END
BEGIN NOW Why, she says, I love you as fresh meat loves salt, says she. END
BEGIN NOW Well, he were that angry. END
BEGIN NOW You don't love me at all, says he, and in my house you stay no more. END
BEGIN NOW So he drove her out there and then, and shut the door in her face. END
BEGIN NOW Well, she went away, on and on, till she came to a fen. END
BEGIN NOW And there she gathered a lot of rushes, and made them into a cloak kind o', with a hood to cover her from head to foot, and to hide her fine clothes. END
BEGIN NOW And then she went on and on till she came to a great house. END
BEGIN NOW Do you want a maid? END
BEGIN NOW says she. END
BEGIN NOW No, we don't, says they. END
BEGIN NOW I hain't nowhere to go, says she, and I'd ask no wages, and do any sort o' work, says she. END
BEGIN NOW Well, says they, if you like to wash the pots and scrape the saucepans, you may stay, says they. END
BEGIN NOW So she stayed there, and washed the pots and scraped the saucepans, and did all the dirty work. END
BEGIN NOW And because she gave no name, they called her Cap o' Rushes. END
BEGIN NOW Well, one day there was to be a great dance a little way off, and the servants was let go and look at the grand people. END
BEGIN NOW Cap o' Rushes said she was too tired to go, so she stayed at home. END
BEGIN NOW But when they was gone, she offed with her cap o' rushes, and cleaned herself, and went to the dance. END
BEGIN NOW And no one there was so finely dressed as her. END
BEGIN NOW Well, who should be there but her master's son, and what should he do but fall in love with her, the minute he set eyes on her. END
BEGIN NOW He wouldn't dance with anyone else. END
BEGIN NOW But before the dance were done, Cap o' Rushes she stepped off, and away she went home. END
BEGIN NOW And when the other maids was back, she was framin' to be asleep with her cap o' rushes on. END
BEGIN NOW Well, next morning, they says to her, You did miss a sight, Cap o' Rushes! END
BEGIN NOW What was that? END
BEGIN NOW says she. END
BEGIN NOW Why the beautifullest lady you ever see, dressed right gay and ga'. END
BEGIN NOW The young master, he never took his eyes off of her. END
BEGIN NOW Well, I should ha' liked to have seen her, says Cap o' Rushes. END
BEGIN NOW Well, there's to be another dance this evening, and perhaps she'll be there. END
BEGIN NOW But come the evening, Cap o' Rushes said she was too tired to go with them. END
BEGIN NOW Howsumdever, when they was gone, she offed with her cap o' rushes, and cleaned herself, and away she went to the dance. END
BEGIN NOW The master's son had been reckoning on seeing her, and he danced with no one else, and never took his eyes off of her. END
BEGIN NOW But before the dance was over, she slipped off, and home she went, and when the maids came back, she framed to be asleep with her cap o' rushes on. END
BEGIN NOW Next day they says to her again, Well, Cap o' Rushes, you should ha' been there to see the lady. END
BEGIN NOW There she was again, gay an' ga', and the young master he never took his eyes off of her. END
BEGIN NOW Well there, says she, I should ha' liked to ha' seen her. END
BEGIN NOW Well, says they, there's a dance again this evening, and you must go with us, for she's sure to be there. END
BEGIN NOW Well, come the evening, Cap o' Rushes said she was too tired to go, and do what they would, she stayed at home. END
BEGIN NOW But when they was gone, she offed with her cap o' rushes, and cleaned herself, and away she went to the dance. END
BEGIN NOW The master's son was rarely glad when he saw her. END
BEGIN NOW He danced with none but her, and never took his eyes off her. END
BEGIN NOW When she wouldn't tell him her name, nor where she came from, he gave her a ring, and told her if he didn't see her again he should die. END
BEGIN NOW Well, afore the dance was over, off she slipped, and home she went, and when the maids came home she was framing to be asleep with her cap o' rushes on. END
BEGIN NOW Well, next day they says to her, There, Cap o' Rushes, you didn't come last night, and now you won't see the lady, for there's no more dances. END
BEGIN NOW Well, I should ha' rarely liked to ha' seen her, says she. END
BEGIN NOW The master's son he tried every way to find out where the lady was gone, but go where he might, and ask whom he might, he never heard nothing about her. END
BEGIN NOW And he got worse and worse for the love of her till he had to keep his bed. END
BEGIN NOW Make some gruel for the young master, they says to the cook. END
BEGIN NOW He's dying for love of the lady. END
BEGIN NOW The cook she set about making it, when Cap o' Rushes came in. END
BEGIN NOW What are you a' doin' on? END
BEGIN NOW says she. END
BEGIN NOW I'm going to make some gruel for the young master, says the cook, for he's dying for love of the lady. END
BEGIN NOW Let me make it, says Cap o' Rushes. END
BEGIN NOW Well, the cook wouldn't at first, but at last she said yes, and Cap o' Rushes made the gruel. END
BEGIN NOW And when she had made it, she slipped the ring into it on the sly, before the cook took it upstairs. END
BEGIN NOW The young man, he drank it, and saw the ring at the bottom. END
BEGIN NOW Send for the cook, says he. END
BEGIN NOW So up she comes. END
BEGIN NOW Who made this here gruel? END
BEGIN NOW says he. END
BEGIN NOW I did, says the cook, for she were frightened, and he looked at her. END
BEGIN NOW No, you didn't, says he. END
BEGIN NOW Say who did it, and you shan't be harmed. END
BEGIN NOW Well, then, 'twas Cap o' Rushes, says she. END
BEGIN NOW So Cap o' Rushes came. END
BEGIN NOW Did you make the gruel? END
BEGIN NOW says he. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, I did, says she. END
BEGIN NOW Where did you get this ring? END
BEGIN NOW says she. END
BEGIN NOW From him as gave it me, says she. END
BEGIN NOW Who are you then? END
BEGIN NOW says the young man. END
BEGIN NOW I'll show you, says she. END
BEGIN NOW And she offed with her cap o' rushes, and there she was in her beautiful clothes. END
BEGIN NOW Well, the master's son he got well very soon, and they was to be married in a little time. END
BEGIN NOW It was to be a very grand wedding, and everyone was asked, far and near. END
BEGIN NOW And Cap o' Rushes' father was asked. END
BEGIN NOW But she never told nobody who she was. END
BEGIN NOW But afore the wedding she went to the cook, and say she, I want you to dress every dish without a mite o' salt. END
BEGIN NOW That will be rarely nasty, says the cook. END
BEGIN NOW That don't signify, says she. END
BEGIN NOW Very well, says the cook. END
BEGIN NOW Well, the wedding day came, and they was married. END
BEGIN NOW And after they was married, all the company sat down to their vittles. END
BEGIN NOW When they began to eat the meat, that was so tasteless they couldn't eat it. END
BEGIN NOW But Cap o' Rushes father, he tried first one dish and then another, and then he burst out crying. END
BEGIN NOW What's the matter? END
BEGIN NOW said the master's son to him. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW says he, I had a daughter. END
BEGIN NOW And I asked her how much she loved me. END
BEGIN NOW And she said, 'As much as fresh meat loves salt.' END
BEGIN NOW And I turned her from my door, for I thought she didn't love me. END
BEGIN NOW And now I see she loved me best of all. END
BEGIN NOW And she may be dead for aught I know. END
BEGIN NOW No, father, here she is, says Cap o' Rushes. END
BEGIN NOW And she goes up to him and puts her arms round him. END
BEGIN NOW And so they was happy ever after.  END
BEGIN NOW O golden-tongued Romance with serene lute! END
BEGIN NOW Fair plumed Syren! END
BEGIN NOW Queen of far away! END
BEGIN NOW Leave melodizing on this wintry day, Shut up thine olden pages, and be mute: Adieu! END
BEGIN NOW for once again the fierce dispute, Betwixt damnation and impassion'd clay Must I burn through; once more humbly assay The bitter-sweet of this Shakespearian fruit. END
BEGIN NOW Chief Poet! END
BEGIN NOW and ye clouds of Albion, Begetters of our deep eternal theme, When through the old oak forest I am gone, Let me not wander in a barren dream, But when I am consumed in the fire, Give me new Phoenix wings to fly at my desire.  END
BEGIN NOW  King Leir once ruled in this land With princely power and peace; And had all things with hearts content, That might his joys increase. END
BEGIN NOW Amongst those things that nature gave, Three daughters fair had he, So princely seeming beautiful, As fairer could not be. END
BEGIN NOW So on a time it pleas'd the king A question thus to move, Which of his daughters to his grace Could shew the dearest love: For to my age you bring content, Quoth he, then let me hear, Which of you three in plighted troth The kindest will appear. END
BEGIN NOW To whom the eldest thus began; Dear father, mind, quoth she, Before your face, to do you good, My blood shall render'd be: And for your sake my bleeding heart Shall here be cut in twain, Ere that I see your reverend age The smallest grief sustain. END
BEGIN NOW And so will I, the second said; Dear father, for your sake, The worst of all extremities I'll gently undertake: And serve your highness night and day With diligence and love; That sweet content and quietness Discomforts may remove. END
BEGIN NOW In doing so, you glad my soul, The aged king reply'd; But what sayst thou, my youngest girl, How is thy love ally'd? END
BEGIN NOW My love (quoth young Cordelia then) Which to your grace I owe, Shall be the duty of a child, And that is all I'll show. END
BEGIN NOW And wilt thou shew no more, quoth he, Than doth thy duty bind? END
BEGIN NOW I well perceive thy love is small, When as no more I find. END
BEGIN NOW Henceforth I banish thee my court, Thou art no child of mine; Nor any part of this my realm By favour shall be thine. END
BEGIN NOW Thy elder sisters loves are more Then well I can demand, To whom I equally bestow My kingdome and my land, My pompal state and all my goods, That lovingly I may With those thy sisters be maintain'd Until my dying day. END
BEGIN NOW Thus flattering speeches won renown, By these two sisters here; The third had causeless banishment, Yet was her love more dear: For poor Cordelia patiently Went wandring up and down, Unhelp'd, unpity'd, gentle maid, Through many an English town: Untill at last in famous France She gentler fortunes found; Though poor and bare, yet she was deem'd The fairest on the ground: Where when the king her virtues heard, And this fair lady seen, With full consent of all his court He made his wife and queen. END
BEGIN NOW Her father king Leir this while With his two daughters staid: Forgetful of their promis'd loves, Full soon the same decay'd; And living in queen Ragan's court, The eldest of the twain, She took from him his chiefest means, And most of all his train. END
BEGIN NOW For whereas twenty men were wont To wait with bended knee: She gave allowance but to ten, And after scarce to three; Nay, one she thought too much for him; So took she all away, In hope that in her court, good king, He would no longer stay. END
BEGIN NOW Am I rewarded thus, quoth he, In giving all I have Unto my children, and to beg For what I lately gave? END
BEGIN NOW I'll go unto my Gonorell: My second child, I know, Will be more kind and pitiful, And will relieve my woe. END
BEGIN NOW Full fast he hies then to her court; Where when she heard his moan Return'd him answer, That she griev'd That all his means were gone: But no way could relieve his wants; Yet if that he would stay Within her kitchen, he should have What scullions gave away. END
BEGIN NOW When he had heard, with bitter tears, He made his answer then; In what I did let me be made Example to all men. END
BEGIN NOW I will return again, quoth he, Unto my Ragan's court; She will not use me thus, I hope, But in a kinder sort. END
BEGIN NOW Where when he came, she gave command To drive him thence away: When he was well within her court (She said) he would not stay. END
BEGIN NOW Then back again to Gonorell The woeful king did hie, That in her kitchen he might have What scullion boy set by. END
BEGIN NOW But there of that he was deny'd, Which she had promis'd late: For once refusing, he should not Come after to her gate. END
BEGIN NOW Thus twixt his daughters, for relief He wandred up and down; Being glad to feed on beggars food, That lately wore a crown. END
BEGIN NOW And calling to remembrance then His youngest daughters words, That said the duty of a child Was all that love affords: But doubting to repair to her, Whom he had banish'd so, Grew frantick mad; for in his mind He bore the wounds of woe: Which made him rend his milk-white locks, And tresses from his head, And all with blood bestain his cheeks, With age and honour spread. END
BEGIN NOW To hills and woods and watry founts He made his hourly moan, Till hills and woods and sensless things, Did seem to sigh and groan. END
BEGIN NOW Even thus possest with discontents, He passed o're to France, In hopes from fair Cordelia there, To find some gentler chance; Most virtuous dame! END
BEGIN NOW which when she heard, Of this her father's grief, As duty bound, she quickly sent Him comfort and relief: And by a train of noble peers, In brave and gallant sort, She gave in charge he should be brought To Aganippus' court; Whose royal king, with noble mind So freely gave consent, To muster up his knights at arms, To fame and courage bent. END
BEGIN NOW And so to England came with speed, To repossesse king Leir And drive his daughters from their thrones By his Cordelia dear. END
BEGIN NOW Where she, true-hearted noble queen, Was in the battel slain; Yet he, good king, in his old days, Possest his crown again. END
BEGIN NOW But when he heard Cordelia's death, Who died indeed for love Of her dear father, in whose cause She did this battle move; He swooning fell upon her breast, From whence he never parted: But on her bosom left his life, That was so truly hearted. END
BEGIN NOW The lords and nobles when they saw The end of these events, The other sisters unto death They doomed by consents; And being dead, their crowns they left Unto the next of kin: Thus have you seen the fall of pride, And disobedient sin.  END
BEGIN NOW  Pa, you're missing the dancing. END
BEGIN NOW Are you all right? END
BEGIN NOW Pa? END
BEGIN NOW Suzannah's late. END
BEGIN NOW She'll be here. END
BEGIN NOW It's a long ways from Austin. END
BEGIN NOW I don't care how far it is. END
BEGIN NOW I want all three of my daughters here. END
BEGIN NOW By God, I'm old, ain't I, Claudia? END
BEGIN NOW As old as this land. END
BEGIN NOW As old as Texas, Pa. Come on. END
BEGIN NOW Everybody's waiting. END
BEGIN NOW There he is. END
BEGIN NOW Right there. END
BEGIN NOW Pa. Where is he? END
BEGIN NOW He'll be along. END
BEGIN NOW Ungrateful lout. END
BEGIN NOW Best not be keeping John Lear waiting. END
BEGIN NOW Now, don't worry about Thomas, Pa. Let's go. END
BEGIN NOW Let's just go. END
BEGIN NOW Play on! END
BEGIN NOW Play on! END
BEGIN NOW Great to see you, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Happy Independence Day, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Thank you, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Happy Independence Day. END
BEGIN NOW I appreciate it. END
BEGIN NOW Henry. END
BEGIN NOW Emmett. END
BEGIN NOW Mr. Lear, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Fine-looking horse you have there. END
BEGIN NOW Best I've ever bred. END
BEGIN NOW Reminds me of that horse you rode at San Jacinto. END
BEGIN NOW I want you to have it. END
BEGIN NOW That's mighty considerate, Henry. END
BEGIN NOW Mr. Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Your father just gave me this horse, Thomas. END
BEGIN NOW It was thoughtful. END
BEGIN NOW I'm regretful you weren't here to see it. END
BEGIN NOW Pa doesn't show that side of himself often. END
BEGIN NOW Are you drunk, son? END
BEGIN NOW Yes, sir. END
BEGIN NOW I've been drinking. END
BEGIN NOW It's a party, ain't it? END
BEGIN NOW Texas Independence Day. END
BEGIN NOW There wouldn't be independence if it weren't for men like your father. END
BEGIN NOW By God, you won't stand before him...\...before me, with that mocking smile on your face. END
BEGIN NOW I will not abide it, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Henry, I'm much obliged to you. END
BEGIN NOW This is as fine a horse as I've seen. END
BEGIN NOW Thank you, John. END
BEGIN NOW Rip! END
BEGIN NOW You take good care of this horse. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Come on, Pa. What is wrong with you? END
BEGIN NOW Does it please you to make a fool out of your father? END
BEGIN NOW To hell with you, boy! END
BEGIN NOW I've had enough of it, Emmett. END
BEGIN NOW I had a whole lifetime of it. END
BEGIN NOW I know, I know. END
BEGIN NOW You still going to San Antonio for a few days? END
BEGIN NOW What do you mean? END
BEGIN NOW Just now might be a good time, is all. END
BEGIN NOW I'll take on your chores, I don't mind. END
BEGIN NOW It'll give Pa a chance to cool down and you a chance to think things over. END
BEGIN NOW Hell, I might do that right now. END
BEGIN NOW Thank you. END
BEGIN NOW Rebecca. END
BEGIN NOW Suzannah. END
BEGIN NOW So glad to see you. END
BEGIN NOW How is he? END
BEGIN NOW More unpredictable than ever. END
BEGIN NOW Has he done anything crazy? END
BEGIN NOW No, but it's still early. END
BEGIN NOW Hello, Pa. How are you? END
BEGIN NOW I'm tolerable. END
BEGIN NOW You're late. END
BEGIN NOW Mr. Tumlinson. END
BEGIN NOW Happy Independence Day. END
BEGIN NOW Claudia! END
BEGIN NOW You've been taking good care of him. END
BEGIN NOW He's ornery as ever. END
BEGIN NOW By God, I am. END
BEGIN NOW Come on up to the house, I got something to tell you gals. END
BEGIN NOW Come on. END
BEGIN NOW Whoa, now! END
BEGIN NOW Close the gate! END
BEGIN NOW Lear! END
BEGIN NOW John Lear! END
BEGIN NOW Where are you? END
BEGIN NOW You hung two of my vaqueros! END
BEGIN NOW Vaqueros? END
BEGIN NOW They were cattle thieves. END
BEGIN NOW They butchered a cow with my brand. END
BEGIN NOW They were starving. END
BEGIN NOW You drove them from their land. END
BEGIN NOW It's my land, Menchaca, my cattle. END
BEGIN NOW You hung two men for one cow! END
BEGIN NOW What kind of man are you? END
BEGIN NOW You know what kind of man I am. END
BEGIN NOW Your father knowed it too. END
BEGIN NOW My father would have shot you dead already, viejo! END
BEGIN NOW You're welcome to try that. END
BEGIN NOW Why don't you try that right now? END
BEGIN NOW This is not over. END
BEGIN NOW Si. END
BEGIN NOW Claro. END
BEGIN NOW Now, get off my land before I hang you too. END
BEGIN NOW Should have driven him right across the Rio Grande when we had a chance. END
BEGIN NOW It's not too late for that. END
BEGIN NOW President Houston asked me to deliver this. END
BEGIN NOW How is Sam? END
BEGIN NOW He ever sober up any? END
BEGIN NOW Where'd I put my spectacles? END
BEGIN NOW It's a proclamation. END
BEGIN NOW Shall I read it? END
BEGIN NOW Oh, hell, I suppose so. END
BEGIN NOW On this anniversary of the birth of our republic, we honor the man...\...without whose valiant spirit Texas would never have been won. END
BEGIN NOW During the darkest days of our struggle, when the Alamo fell...\...when his own beloved son was martyred at Goliad, John Lear&mdash; All right, Tumlinson, I get the point of it. END
BEGIN NOW Houston always was a long-winded, preachifying son of a bitch. END
BEGIN NOW But I got more important matters to discuss today. END
BEGIN NOW There's the Palo Blanco...\...all , acres of it. END
BEGIN NOW There's the main house. END
BEGIN NOW There's your place, Rebecca. END
BEGIN NOW Every creek in between. END
BEGIN NOW Every acre paid for in blood. END
BEGIN NOW Always thought I'd turn the place over to my boy...\...but he's dead and gone. END
BEGIN NOW It's come to me how my life ain't been more concern...\...to this land than a blade of grass or a mesquite tree. END
BEGIN NOW Just one more thing that lived on it and had its day and passed on. END
BEGIN NOW But by God...\...I can still decide who owns it. END
BEGIN NOW I have decided to divide up the ranch. END
BEGIN NOW What do you mean, Daddy? END
BEGIN NOW As from today...\...I am giving the ranch over to you three gals. END
BEGIN NOW I wanna get all this settled now so there won't be any fighting...\...amongst you after I'm gone. END
BEGIN NOW Are you feeling all right? END
BEGIN NOW I'm feeling fine, Claudia. END
BEGIN NOW I'm even gonna lead the roundup this year, like always. END
BEGIN NOW But I won't be here forever, and I wanna get this settled. END
BEGIN NOW And who gets which part of the land? END
BEGIN NOW Well, Suzannah, I suppose that depends. END
BEGIN NOW On what? END
BEGIN NOW On who loves their father the most. END
BEGIN NOW Go ahead, you're the eldest, Suzannah. END
BEGIN NOW Speak up. END
BEGIN NOW There's no man in this country who can stand next to my father. END
BEGIN NOW No man who ever could. END
BEGIN NOW You came to Texas with nothing...\...and you made an empire. END
BEGIN NOW Maybe you were hard, but that's because you had to be. END
BEGIN NOW If you hadn't been, we would've been carried away by Comanches years ago. END
BEGIN NOW So I love you for your strength. END
BEGIN NOW And I love you for the strength you gave me. END
BEGIN NOW I'll give you all the land east of Las Animas Creek. END
BEGIN NOW There's good range there, all the way up to the headwaters. END
BEGIN NOW But your house is on that side. END
BEGIN NOW I know that, Suzannah. END
BEGIN NOW I'll move downstairs. END
BEGIN NOW You and your husband can move in up here. END
BEGIN NOW I'll spend half the year with you and half at Rebecca's. END
BEGIN NOW That appeal to you, Mr. Tumlinson? END
BEGIN NOW Oh, yes. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, indeed. END
BEGIN NOW It's very generous. END
BEGIN NOW Now, Rebecca. END
BEGIN NOW Daddy, I don't know what to say. END
BEGIN NOW You don't? END
BEGIN NOW If I had Suzannah's way with words, I could tell you how much I love you. END
BEGIN NOW Hush, Claudia. END
BEGIN NOW You'll get your turn. END
BEGIN NOW It's not a speaking thing. END
BEGIN NOW It's a feeling thing. END
BEGIN NOW It's the same feeling when I ride across the prairie before dawn...\...and the sun comes up and warms my face...\...and all the wildflower blossoms start to open. END
BEGIN NOW That's how much I love you, Daddy. END
BEGIN NOW Like I love the sun. END
BEGIN NOW I'll give you all the land west of the creek&mdash; Sir. END
BEGIN NOW The soil in there gets very salty. END
BEGIN NOW It's not good for grazing. END
BEGIN NOW I know that. END
BEGIN NOW You hold your horses, Highsmith. END
BEGIN NOW All land west of the creek...\...and south of the ruins of that old Spanish fort. END
BEGIN NOW You like that any better? END
BEGIN NOW Yes, sir. END
BEGIN NOW I do. END
BEGIN NOW Now, Claudia, I'll listen to you. END
BEGIN NOW There's some prime land left. END
BEGIN NOW I have nothing to say. END
BEGIN NOW What did she say? END
BEGIN NOW She said she had nothing to say. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing? END
BEGIN NOW Nothing! END
BEGIN NOW Nothing can come of nothing. END
BEGIN NOW You best think again. END
BEGIN NOW I won't. END
BEGIN NOW This is false. END
BEGIN NOW I want nothing to do with it. END
BEGIN NOW False? END
BEGIN NOW What do you mean, false? END
BEGIN NOW Heed your words, unless you wanna throw away your fortune. END
BEGIN NOW A child either loves her father or she doesn't. END
BEGIN NOW Yes! END
BEGIN NOW Well, say it. END
BEGIN NOW Why won't you say it? END
BEGIN NOW Because you should see it, Pa. Don't I prove my love to you every day, living here, taking care of you? END
BEGIN NOW Suzannah and Rebecca took husbands. END
BEGIN NOW She's just proud. END
BEGIN NOW She's her father's daughter. END
BEGIN NOW You keep out of this, Tumlinson. END
BEGIN NOW Say it, Claudia. END
BEGIN NOW Love isn't something you can command. END
BEGIN NOW It's either there or it's not. END
BEGIN NOW Say it. END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW Say it! END
BEGIN NOW John, I think if you consider&mdash; What kind of child is this? END
BEGIN NOW Is this a child I sheltered in my house? END
BEGIN NOW A child I gave my heart to? END
BEGIN NOW She's got no more feeling than a low-down rattlesnake! END
BEGIN NOW It's because I have too much feeling&mdash; All these years, pretending to love your father...\...when all you had inside you was hateful poison! END
BEGIN NOW By God, I won't keep no rattler in this house! END
BEGIN NOW You have no portion! END
BEGIN NOW That's enough! END
BEGIN NOW Who the hell are you, telling John Lear how much he can speak?! END
BEGIN NOW Pa. Too late, Claudia! END
BEGIN NOW I won't listen! END
BEGIN NOW I won't look into your face ever again! END
BEGIN NOW You have no home! END
BEGIN NOW No father! END
BEGIN NOW Go! END
BEGIN NOW Get! END
BEGIN NOW You can't send her away like this&mdash; Keep your silence in my presence. END
BEGIN NOW Or, by God, I will strike you down! END
BEGIN NOW You understand me, sir? END
BEGIN NOW Why are you still here? END
BEGIN NOW Get out of my house. END
BEGIN NOW I will divide the ranch equally between you two gals and your husbands. END
BEGIN NOW Daddy! END
BEGIN NOW Don't say nothing to me, Rebecca. END
BEGIN NOW I don't care to hear it. END
BEGIN NOW I bid you all good day. END
BEGIN NOW It'll be all right. END
BEGIN NOW He'll come to his senses. END
BEGIN NOW No, he won't. END
BEGIN NOW He won't ever let me come back. END
BEGIN NOW Suzannah and I will be living here. END
BEGIN NOW We'll talk to him. END
BEGIN NOW Come on. END
BEGIN NOW The division north to south along the creek is fair. END
BEGIN NOW Does it suit you, Mr. Highsmith? END
BEGIN NOW I'll tell you what will suit me. END
BEGIN NOW That's Menchaca's land. END
BEGIN NOW Menchaca says it is. END
BEGIN NOW It's disputed land. END
BEGIN NOW Everybody knows it. END
BEGIN NOW A man could run a lot of cattle there. END
BEGIN NOW And start another war. END
BEGIN NOW We never finished the last one. END
BEGIN NOW My husband wouldn't allow it. END
BEGIN NOW Of course not. END
BEGIN NOW Your husband's a good man. END
BEGIN NOW Member of the Texas government. END
BEGIN NOW But isn't he going back to Austin soon to meet with the legislature? END
BEGIN NOW I don't know&mdash; Hush. END
BEGIN NOW I'm talking to your sister. END
BEGIN NOW Now, you and I...\...we know a fight with Menchaca is inevitable. END
BEGIN NOW We've got to get the first lick in if we're to have any hope of victory. END
BEGIN NOW Claudia? END
BEGIN NOW Miss Claudia! END
BEGIN NOW Miss Claudia, where are you going? END
BEGIN NOW What has happened, Claudia? END
BEGIN NOW He turned me out. END
BEGIN NOW Your father? END
BEGIN NOW You shouldn't be so hard on Thomas. END
BEGIN NOW Why not? END
BEGIN NOW If I hadn't promised his mother the ranch would be his&mdash; No use speaking about that. END
BEGIN NOW I learned to live with being a bastard. END
BEGIN NOW And the ranch ain't big enough to split up. END
BEGIN NOW Where are the horses? END
BEGIN NOW They're all gone, Pa! END
BEGIN NOW Placido. END
BEGIN NOW I'm gonna kill the man that done this. END
BEGIN NOW Careful. END
BEGIN NOW Put it on the far side of the parlor. END
BEGIN NOW Si, senora. END
BEGIN NOW Music! END
BEGIN NOW That's what this house has been missing since your ma passed on. END
BEGIN NOW You're making this a proper home again. END
BEGIN NOW After a week or two on the campo, I might want a tune out of this piano. END
BEGIN NOW I'll play you one. END
BEGIN NOW Make me a peach pie. END
BEGIN NOW After a roundup, I'm partial to peach pie. END
BEGIN NOW I will, Pa. Warnell. END
BEGIN NOW Ma'am. END
BEGIN NOW Keep an eye on him. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, ma'am. END
BEGIN NOW Morning, men! END
BEGIN NOW Fine day for a roundup. END
BEGIN NOW You're right about that, boss. END
BEGIN NOW You too old to go on a roundup. END
BEGIN NOW I ain't particularly interested in your opinion, Rip. END
BEGIN NOW I know that. END
BEGIN NOW You never been interested in anybody's opinion. END
BEGIN NOW You fall off and you break your neck. END
BEGIN NOW I don't intend to fall off. END
BEGIN NOW Well, I expect you never intended to get so damn old, either. END
BEGIN NOW Rip, saddle your horse. END
BEGIN NOW Why? END
BEGIN NOW Because you're going with me. END
BEGIN NOW I believe I'll stay right here. END
BEGIN NOW This place gets pleasant when you ain't around. END
BEGIN NOW It ain't my business to make your life pleasant. END
BEGIN NOW You're going with us. END
BEGIN NOW Why? END
BEGIN NOW Because you're the only son of a bitch that could make me laugh. END
BEGIN NOW Mount up, men! END
BEGIN NOW Rip, over there, in the flank! END
BEGIN NOW Get along, there! END
BEGIN NOW By God, this is a tonic being out here again. END
BEGIN NOW I don't think nothing suits me better than hard country and wild cattle. END
BEGIN NOW Rip, you sing me a song. END
BEGIN NOW Maybe you need to come live among these cows...\...since your singing voice ain't fit for no human to hear. END
BEGIN NOW By God, Rip, I don't know why I let you talk to me that way. END
BEGIN NOW If you were a mite brainier, you'd watch your tongue, have fear of me. END
BEGIN NOW All the fear got scared out of me at the Alamo. END
BEGIN NOW Who the hell's that? END
BEGIN NOW Afternoon. END
BEGIN NOW Afternoon to you, sir. END
BEGIN NOW You would be Mr. Westover? END
BEGIN NOW That's right. END
BEGIN NOW Lieutenant Williams, U.S. Army. END
BEGIN NOW What can I do for you? END
BEGIN NOW I was hoping you'd have more horses to sell. END
BEGIN NOW Army needs good stock. END
BEGIN NOW I never sold horses to no Army. END
BEGIN NOW They had your brand on them. END
BEGIN NOW It was a legal transaction. END
BEGIN NOW How many was it you bought? END
BEGIN NOW I believe it was Who sold them to you? END
BEGIN NOW Didn't care to give his name. END
BEGIN NOW What did he look like? END
BEGIN NOW A Mexican? END
BEGIN NOW He weren't Mexican. END
BEGIN NOW He had some height to him, brown hair...\...and as I recollect he had a scar on his forehead. END
BEGIN NOW Didn't look like no horse thief, if that's what you're thinking. END
BEGIN NOW Better move on, mister. END
BEGIN NOW Ain't no horses for sale here. END
BEGIN NOW Sorry to trouble you, then. END
BEGIN NOW Good day to you both. END
BEGIN NOW I'm sure it's a mistake. END
BEGIN NOW Of course it's a mistake. END
BEGIN NOW Eighteen horses, Emmett, ! END
BEGIN NOW That man said he had a scar on his forehead like Thomas has. END
BEGIN NOW Thomas would never do anything like that. END
BEGIN NOW He'd never steal from his own father. END
BEGIN NOW You just put it out of your mind, Pa. Bring them up, there. END
BEGIN NOW Hard work. END
BEGIN NOW Mind if I water my horse? END
BEGIN NOW Just your horse. END
BEGIN NOW Because I wouldn't want no slave to foul this water by drinking from it. END
BEGIN NOW I told you not to do that. END
BEGIN NOW You're that son of a bitch from the Alamo, aren't you? END
BEGIN NOW Did you ever notice how a mesquite branch is all covered with thorns? END
BEGIN NOW The Lord was thinking about runaway slaves when he created that tree. END
BEGIN NOW I ain't no runaway slave. END
BEGIN NOW How's a feller to know any different? END
BEGIN NOW You got a paper saying you ain't? END
BEGIN NOW You got a paper saying you ain't a pea-brained son of a bitch? END
BEGIN NOW Well, now, did that hurt enough? END
BEGIN NOW I thought he was running away from you. END
BEGIN NOW I thought he was stealing that horse and running away&mdash; No, no! END
BEGIN NOW Don't hit me no more, boss. END
BEGIN NOW You gonna interfere with my property again? END
BEGIN NOW No, sir, I ain't. END
BEGIN NOW Get the hell out of here! END
BEGIN NOW I believe one of the boys in the outfit has got some aloe salve. END
BEGIN NOW I appreciate it, but then my shirt's all ripped to hell. END
BEGIN NOW Why you telling me? END
BEGIN NOW I ain't no damn seamstress. END
BEGIN NOW I ain't never took you for one. END
BEGIN NOW You get on your horse before we waste any more time. END
BEGIN NOW You're heading home, I see. END
BEGIN NOW Time to go to our part of the ranch. END
BEGIN NOW As you know, my husband will be gone for several weeks, at least. END
BEGIN NOW What do you have in mind? END
BEGIN NOW Let's not play games, Mr. Highsmith. END
BEGIN NOW We'll need men. END
BEGIN NOW I have a dozen at my ranch. END
BEGIN NOW We'll need more. END
BEGIN NOW We should talk to Mr. Westover. END
BEGIN NOW If the man who captured Santa Ana joins us, others will too. END
BEGIN NOW She's right. END
BEGIN NOW Westover's always game for a fight. END
BEGIN NOW He'll want to know where Lear stands. END
BEGIN NOW Tell him my father stands with us. END
BEGIN NOW I hope you brought your brother something from San Antonio. END
BEGIN NOW A bottle of whiskey might be just the thing. END
BEGIN NOW Where's the horses? END
BEGIN NOW You best ask Pa about that. END
BEGIN NOW He's inside taking supper. END
BEGIN NOW I'll see to your gear. END
BEGIN NOW Hey, how you doing, Pa? END
BEGIN NOW Where's the horses? END
BEGIN NOW Stoled. END
BEGIN NOW Stole? END
BEGIN NOW All of them? END
BEGIN NOW Oh, hell, where's Placido? END
BEGIN NOW You know damn well where he is. END
BEGIN NOW Lying in his grave. END
BEGIN NOW He's what? END
BEGIN NOW I don't know why you would do such a thing. END
BEGIN NOW But I guess if a man's got enough hate in his heart, he can do anything. END
BEGIN NOW You think I stole our horses? END
BEGIN NOW That I killed Placido? END
BEGIN NOW Look at me, Pa. Look at me! END
BEGIN NOW You think I stole them horses. END
BEGIN NOW I do. END
BEGIN NOW Boy, I don't see that bottle of whiskey in here. END
BEGIN NOW Hell, you must really hate me. END
BEGIN NOW I drink some and I shoot my mouth off. END
BEGIN NOW But I ain't no thief and no murderer! END
BEGIN NOW Pa, that ain't mine. END
BEGIN NOW Liar! END
BEGIN NOW You're a liar, a horse thief and a murderer! END
BEGIN NOW You lost your mind with age, old man! END
BEGIN NOW Get out. END
BEGIN NOW Get out of my house. END
BEGIN NOW Don't you never come back. END
BEGIN NOW I thought you'd forgotten all about me. END
BEGIN NOW How was my performance? END
BEGIN NOW Think I should take to the boards? END
BEGIN NOW You really should. END
BEGIN NOW Me and my men have done right by you, Mr. Westover. END
BEGIN NOW Made a good profit from them horses. END
BEGIN NOW Fifty-fifty, just like we said. END
BEGIN NOW Do you mind if I keep the uniform? END
BEGIN NOW I admire the way I look in it. END
BEGIN NOW You can keep the uniform. END
BEGIN NOW A fair increase, Suzannah. END
BEGIN NOW Hardly a cow this year without a calf to suck on her. END
BEGIN NOW I hope to hell you made that peach pie. END
BEGIN NOW You beat Warnell half to death. END
BEGIN NOW He was torturing Rip. END
BEGIN NOW You should've come to me. END
BEGIN NOW I would have dealt with it. END
BEGIN NOW Come to you? END
BEGIN NOW That'll be a cold day in hell. END
BEGIN NOW I can take care of my own business. END
BEGIN NOW This coffee's cold as well water. END
BEGIN NOW You gave up business, did you forget? END
BEGIN NOW If one of my men needs to be punished, I will do the deciding. END
BEGIN NOW You will watch your tongue with me. END
BEGIN NOW Get some supper on! END
BEGIN NOW My men are hungry. END
BEGIN NOW They've been herding cattle. END
BEGIN NOW I'll feed your men. END
BEGIN NOW But don't expect any hospitality. END
BEGIN NOW You won't find it. END
BEGIN NOW Not after what you did to Warnell. END
BEGIN NOW Show some respect. END
BEGIN NOW Respect. END
BEGIN NOW Respect for you, you pathetic, addled old man. END
BEGIN NOW Riling me is pleasurable, ain't it? END
BEGIN NOW Rile me more, and you will be sorry. END
BEGIN NOW Now, you get some supper on. END
BEGIN NOW For me and for my men. END
BEGIN NOW There you go. END
BEGIN NOW Give me another one. END
BEGIN NOW What are you doing? END
BEGIN NOW We're raising holy hell, Suzannah! END
BEGIN NOW Well, you stop it right now! END
BEGIN NOW I won't have your men shooting off their guns around my house. END
BEGIN NOW You'll have it if I say you'll have it. END
BEGIN NOW I want to see you make that bell ring. END
BEGIN NOW Better ring that bell. END
BEGIN NOW Get out of here! END
BEGIN NOW Leave my house. END
BEGIN NOW Your house? END
BEGIN NOW This is my house. END
BEGIN NOW Not anymore. END
BEGIN NOW By God, you'd do it, wouldn't you? END
BEGIN NOW You'd kill your own father. END
BEGIN NOW You men, go on, now. END
BEGIN NOW Go on to the bunkhouse. END
BEGIN NOW Go on! END
BEGIN NOW Do as I tell you! END
BEGIN NOW They won't obey you. END
BEGIN NOW They work for me. END
BEGIN NOW No, they don't. END
BEGIN NOW They work for me. END
BEGIN NOW You hear that? END
BEGIN NOW You work for me! END
BEGIN NOW If you don't do as I say, you'll never see your wages again. END
BEGIN NOW I own the ranch now! END
BEGIN NOW Mr. Lear? END
BEGIN NOW Go on. END
BEGIN NOW Do like she says. END
BEGIN NOW You and the rest of the men, get out of here. END
BEGIN NOW Go on, get out of here! END
BEGIN NOW All of you! END
BEGIN NOW Why? END
BEGIN NOW Why, Suzannah? END
BEGIN NOW Why have you turned against me? END
BEGIN NOW I gave you the ranch. END
BEGIN NOW I gave you everything! END
BEGIN NOW You didn't give it to me, Pa. You sold it to me. END
BEGIN NOW You came up with the price and I met it. END
BEGIN NOW And don't you think that price came easy to me. END
BEGIN NOW Having to say I loved you, when all I've ever felt for you was hate. END
BEGIN NOW Hate? END
BEGIN NOW You are nothing but an old tyrant. END
BEGIN NOW That's all you are. END
BEGIN NOW You worked our mother to death. END
BEGIN NOW And you never took no notice of Rebecca or me. END
BEGIN NOW Ever. END
BEGIN NOW All you cared about was your son. END
BEGIN NOW And after he died, all you cared about was Claudia. END
BEGIN NOW Well, they're gone now, and your day is over. END
BEGIN NOW No, it ain't over. END
BEGIN NOW And when it's over...\...I'll rise up out of the pit, and I'll haunt you to your grave! END
BEGIN NOW I'll do something. END
BEGIN NOW I don't know what, but you'll be sorry you lived to see it! END
BEGIN NOW I remember the day you were born. END
BEGIN NOW Your ma held you up to me and she said, John, here is your daughter. END
BEGIN NOW And you were a fine, healthy child. END
BEGIN NOW And I had a tender feeling in my heart for you that day. END
BEGIN NOW But that feeling is gone from my heart. END
BEGIN NOW You're dead to me now, dead as winter grass! END
BEGIN NOW I only got one daughter now! END
BEGIN NOW Well, she's welcome to have you! END
BEGIN NOW I hope Miss Highsmith'll be happier to see you than Miss Tumlinson. END
BEGIN NOW Rebecca's a devoted child. END
BEGIN NOW The only one in the bunch. END
BEGIN NOW You sure of that? END
BEGIN NOW Yes, I'm sure. END
BEGIN NOW She told me so. END
BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW I used to think old people was wise. END
BEGIN NOW But they ain't. END
BEGIN NOW You sure the proof of that. END
BEGIN NOW I never said I was wise. END
BEGIN NOW I never boasted about a damn thing. END
BEGIN NOW Why do my children hate me, Rip? END
BEGIN NOW Don't ask if you don't want the truth. END
BEGIN NOW You tell me. END
BEGIN NOW Because there ain't no love in you. END
BEGIN NOW Only pride. END
BEGIN NOW I'm in a hurtful way, Rip. END
BEGIN NOW The way I deal with pain is to pretend it's done with. END
BEGIN NOW What do you mean? END
BEGIN NOW What I mean is...\...I think of myself like I was dead. END
BEGIN NOW Supposed to be, anyway. END
BEGIN NOW I was supposed to be killed at the Alamo. END
BEGIN NOW So I'm a ghost, I reckon. END
BEGIN NOW Pain don't bother me none. END
BEGIN NOW People don't either. END
BEGIN NOW All that's done with. END
BEGIN NOW Where are you going? END
BEGIN NOW I think Rebecca's house is over there. END
BEGIN NOW Yeah. END
BEGIN NOW Just behind the shoulder of that hill. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, that's it. END
BEGIN NOW Well, I'm all right now. END
BEGIN NOW I just got a little turned around there for a while. END
BEGIN NOW Her house ain't that away. END
BEGIN NOW You sure? END
BEGIN NOW I'm sure. END
BEGIN NOW It ain't right that I should be lost. END
BEGIN NOW This is my land. END
BEGIN NOW I own it. END
BEGIN NOW I know it. END
BEGIN NOW By God, I created this land out of nothing. END
BEGIN NOW Come on, now. END
BEGIN NOW We'll find Miss Highsmith's house. END
BEGIN NOW Am I going mad, Rip? END
BEGIN NOW I don't know. END
BEGIN NOW Don't let me go mad, Rip. END
BEGIN NOW You shoot me first. END
BEGIN NOW You can attack soon. END
BEGIN NOW But how does Lear stand on this? END
BEGIN NOW Lear is with us. END
BEGIN NOW John Lear's a careful man for all his temper. END
BEGIN NOW He must see some advantage to it. END
BEGIN NOW He does. END
BEGIN NOW How many men would we need? END
BEGIN NOW About men. END
BEGIN NOW Menchaca's got a lot of vaqueros at his place and two six-pounders. END
BEGIN NOW We need some cannons ourselves. END
BEGIN NOW We'll get it, especially if you join. END
BEGIN NOW Your husband got himself a bold notion. END
BEGIN NOW He's a bold man. END
BEGIN NOW Reckless one is what I heard. END
BEGIN NOW And mean. END
BEGIN NOW The sort of man that might take after his own wife. END
BEGIN NOW That's hateful gossip. END
BEGIN NOW Don't mean it ain't true. END
BEGIN NOW You worried about me? END
BEGIN NOW It's possible I am. END
BEGIN NOW Your pa listens to you. END
BEGIN NOW Make sure he joins us. END
BEGIN NOW Why? END
BEGIN NOW Because there's gain to be had. END
BEGIN NOW Land and cattle. END
BEGIN NOW And other things. END
BEGIN NOW Rebecca? END
BEGIN NOW Rebecca! END
BEGIN NOW John, welcome. END
BEGIN NOW Come in and take a horn with me. END
BEGIN NOW We've got some business to discuss. END
BEGIN NOW That I will. END
BEGIN NOW Rebecca. END
BEGIN NOW Rebecca, I went to your house looking for you. END
BEGIN NOW They told me you were here. END
BEGIN NOW I needed you, Rebecca. END
BEGIN NOW Something happen to Suzannah? END
BEGIN NOW She turned me out. END
BEGIN NOW Well, I'm sure she didn't mean to. END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW You know the respect a child owes her father. END
BEGIN NOW You're the only one that does. END
BEGIN NOW Why are you here? END
BEGIN NOW To talk about the plan. END
BEGIN NOW Plan? END
BEGIN NOW What plan? END
BEGIN NOW To ride against Menchaca. END
BEGIN NOW Same plan they told you. END
BEGIN NOW Menchaca? END
BEGIN NOW Nobody told me nothing about fighting Menchaca. END
BEGIN NOW This was your idea, Highsmith? END
BEGIN NOW lt is. END
BEGIN NOW And you'd do well to join us. END
BEGIN NOW If not for the Menchacas, your son would be alive. END
BEGIN NOW I know why my son is dead. END
BEGIN NOW And you know I gave an oath to Sam Houston to not touch Menchaca's land. END
BEGIN NOW You came into my house and lied? END
BEGIN NOW I'm not gonna tolerate that. END
BEGIN NOW But you'll tolerate Menchaca right there. END
BEGIN NOW A land that ought to belong to Texas! END
BEGIN NOW Ought to belong to us! END
BEGIN NOW Can't you see? END
BEGIN NOW This is our chance. END
BEGIN NOW Any man that doesn't take his chance is a coward. END
BEGIN NOW You call me a coward, sir? END
BEGIN NOW By God, I saw your courage at San Jacinto. END
BEGIN NOW Shooting down Mexicans that was trying to surrender. END
BEGIN NOW Any man that talks to me like that, I'll tickle his ribs. END
BEGIN NOW You'd be with us, if you had any sand left. END
BEGIN NOW Why, you&mdash; Daddy. END
BEGIN NOW Get your horse, Rebecca. END
BEGIN NOW You're coming with me. END
BEGIN NOW I should have never let you marry a man with such viciousness and treachery. END
BEGIN NOW I'm taking you away from him. END
BEGIN NOW I ain't going. END
BEGIN NOW You ain't going? END
BEGIN NOW Why? END
BEGIN NOW He's my husband. END
BEGIN NOW Child, he ain't fit to be your husband. END
BEGIN NOW I know I ain't always been a proper father. END
BEGIN NOW But I loved you the best of my daughters. END
BEGIN NOW No, you didn't. END
BEGIN NOW The hell, you say. END
BEGIN NOW I know my heart! END
BEGIN NOW Oh, you were always my favorite, Rebecca. END
BEGIN NOW Come on. END
BEGIN NOW It's just gonna be you and me from now on. END
BEGIN NOW Don't you defy me, child! END
BEGIN NOW I'm staying with my husband. END
BEGIN NOW Fine. END
BEGIN NOW You stay. END
BEGIN NOW You stay with that fine man. END
BEGIN NOW You're well-suited. END
BEGIN NOW Daddy. END
BEGIN NOW Get on! END
BEGIN NOW You're no part of me anyway...\...except as a disease or sickness in my body is part of me. END
BEGIN NOW Please stop it. END
BEGIN NOW You're my enemy, just as your sisters are my enemy. END
BEGIN NOW You have your fight with Menchaca. END
BEGIN NOW But when you scream for your daddy...\...when those vaqueros have you on your back, knives at your throat...\...when you're screaming for John Lear, I won't hear you. END
BEGIN NOW I'll be deaf to your cries. END
BEGIN NOW So I bid you all good day. END
BEGIN NOW May you all burn in hell. END
BEGIN NOW Daddy. END
BEGIN NOW You're a fool, Highsmith. END
BEGIN NOW You'll see who's the fool. END
BEGIN NOW Come, Rebecca. END
BEGIN NOW Come. END
BEGIN NOW Rip! END
BEGIN NOW Where are you going? END
BEGIN NOW You turning away from me too? END
BEGIN NOW Is it true what they say? END
BEGIN NOW They fixing to raid Menchaca? END
BEGIN NOW That's true, Rip. END
BEGIN NOW Then Miss Claudia in danger. END
BEGIN NOW Claudia's at Menchaca's? END
BEGIN NOW That she is. END
BEGIN NOW How do you know? END
BEGIN NOW I'm just accustomed to seeing things with my eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Somebody got to warn her. END
BEGIN NOW Do you remember that terrible storm when we were children? END
BEGIN NOW Your father and my father went to the campo to keep the cattle from drowning. END
BEGIN NOW I remember. END
BEGIN NOW My grandmother was sick and your mother came with medicine. END
BEGIN NOW That was the first time I saw you. END
BEGIN NOW I'm alone. END
BEGIN NOW Westover, what is so important you would risk coming here? END
BEGIN NOW Where's Miss Claudia? END
BEGIN NOW Claudia's not here. END
BEGIN NOW I know she is. END
BEGIN NOW Well, you need not worry. END
BEGIN NOW If she were here, she'd be safe. END
BEGIN NOW I don't think she would be. END
BEGIN NOW Why not? END
BEGIN NOW God forgive me for saying this. END
BEGIN NOW There's a plan. END
BEGIN NOW They're coming to take your land. END
BEGIN NOW I don't remember a time without a plan. END
BEGIN NOW But this time it's gonna happen. END
BEGIN NOW Highsmith's gathering men. END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW Lear would not be doing this. END
BEGIN NOW He's capable of many things, but he never break his word. END
BEGIN NOW Lear's not in charge. END
BEGIN NOW He's been turned out. END
BEGIN NOW Who turned him out? END
BEGIN NOW The other daughters. END
BEGIN NOW He ain't got no home to go to anymore. END
BEGIN NOW You've got to find him, Mr. Henry, and bring him to me. END
BEGIN NOW Miss Claudia. END
BEGIN NOW Find my father, Mr. Henry. END
BEGIN NOW Please. END
BEGIN NOW He'll listen to you. END
BEGIN NOW He's always respected you. END
BEGIN NOW Bring him back to me, please. END
BEGIN NOW Come on, over here! END
BEGIN NOW It's coming right down on us. END
BEGIN NOW Let it come. END
BEGIN NOW So you've riled yourself up against me too, have you? END
BEGIN NOW You think I'm old! END
BEGIN NOW You think I'm weak! END
BEGIN NOW Just like my daughters! END
BEGIN NOW You see? END
BEGIN NOW You missed me! END
BEGIN NOW I'm still here! END
BEGIN NOW I'm still my god in my saddle! END
BEGIN NOW You want to get yourself killed? END
BEGIN NOW I don't give a damn! END
BEGIN NOW Blow! END
BEGIN NOW You bastard wind, blow! END
BEGIN NOW I'm right here! END
BEGIN NOW Come and get me! END
BEGIN NOW Don't be afraid! END
BEGIN NOW There ain't nothing standing in your way but me! END
BEGIN NOW Get me! END
BEGIN NOW Right down here. END
BEGIN NOW Come on! END
BEGIN NOW Come on! END
BEGIN NOW Lear! END
BEGIN NOW Lear! END
BEGIN NOW Somebody calling. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, yes. END
BEGIN NOW There's somebody calling. END
BEGIN NOW There must have been a storm. END
BEGIN NOW There's a fresh smell in the air. END
BEGIN NOW Look at that sky. END
BEGIN NOW You ever see a sky so blue? END
BEGIN NOW John! END
BEGIN NOW John? END
BEGIN NOW John. END
BEGIN NOW I heard somebody calling. END
BEGIN NOW Was that you? END
BEGIN NOW It was me. END
BEGIN NOW I don't think I know you. END
BEGIN NOW I used to know everybody in this country...\...but there are so damn many of them now. END
BEGIN NOW It's Henry. END
BEGIN NOW Henry Westover. END
BEGIN NOW I'm your friend. END
BEGIN NOW I thank you, friend. END
BEGIN NOW Sit down. END
BEGIN NOW You got children, mister? END
BEGIN NOW Two boys. END
BEGIN NOW You know them. END
BEGIN NOW I do? END
BEGIN NOW I had a son of my own once, I believe. END
BEGIN NOW I can't quite recall. END
BEGIN NOW Well, I got daughters. END
BEGIN NOW Three of them. END
BEGIN NOW They make a man proud...\...the way they look at you with their eyes full of love. END
BEGIN NOW Just shining with love for their father. END
BEGIN NOW There ain't no better feeling in this world, is there, mister...\...than to know you done right by your children? END
BEGIN NOW No, John, no better feeling. END
BEGIN NOW Why are you crying, mister? END
BEGIN NOW Come on, I wanna take you home. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, no. END
BEGIN NOW I don't need to go anywhere. END
BEGIN NOW This is my home, right here where I sit. END
BEGIN NOW Hey, you see him? END
BEGIN NOW By God, I'm right up there with him. END
BEGIN NOW I feel everything he feels. END
BEGIN NOW I'm looking down on everything that he sees. END
BEGIN NOW I'm right up there with him, sailing in the wind. END
BEGIN NOW Come on, to the place! END
BEGIN NOW The place where he's going! END
BEGIN NOW Come on! END
BEGIN NOW Don't you wanna see it, that place? END
BEGIN NOW The place where he's going? END
BEGIN NOW Come on. END
BEGIN NOW Where'd he go? END
BEGIN NOW Come on, God, where'd he go? END
BEGIN NOW Oh, no. END
BEGIN NOW No, no, no. END
BEGIN NOW Don't you turn your back on me! END
BEGIN NOW Come back! END
BEGIN NOW Don't you turn away from me! END
BEGIN NOW Emmett! END
BEGIN NOW Mr. Westover. END
BEGIN NOW What do you want, Highsmith? END
BEGIN NOW I wanna know where you've been. END
BEGIN NOW How do you know that I've been anywheres? END
BEGIN NOW Did Emmett tell you? END
BEGIN NOW Now, Mr. Westover, we'll see who's the fool. END
BEGIN NOW Help him. END
BEGIN NOW Where were you? END
BEGIN NOW Who did you talk to? END
BEGIN NOW Go to hell. END
BEGIN NOW Where were you? END
BEGIN NOW Who did you talk to? END
BEGIN NOW You're wasting your time. END
BEGIN NOW We're gonna have to move fast. END
BEGIN NOW Gather whatever men you can and meet at my house. END
BEGIN NOW How do you know they'll follow me? END
BEGIN NOW I'll pay them. END
BEGIN NOW I don't know what you want out of life, but I suspect it's something big. END
BEGIN NOW You don't aspire to small things, do you? END
BEGIN NOW Small never appealed to me. END
BEGIN NOW It was just the only thing ever offered. END
BEGIN NOW A man wants something big, he's gotta go out and get it. END
BEGIN NOW Smithwick! END
BEGIN NOW Davis! END
BEGIN NOW Bring him over here. END
BEGIN NOW Now, hold him tight. END
BEGIN NOW Hold him steady, now. END
BEGIN NOW Hold him. END
BEGIN NOW Hold him, damn it! END
BEGIN NOW No, I won't do that. END
BEGIN NOW Get back here! END
BEGIN NOW Get back here. END
BEGIN NOW I won't do that. END
BEGIN NOW Get back here, damn it! END
BEGIN NOW Hold him! END
BEGIN NOW I got him. END
BEGIN NOW Hold him. END
BEGIN NOW I got him. END
BEGIN NOW You got one eye left and you don't want me to burn that out. END
BEGIN NOW Tell me where you&mdash; You shot me, you son of a bitch. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, sir, I did. END
BEGIN NOW Are you planning to interfere? END
BEGIN NOW No, ma'am. END
BEGIN NOW He's dead, Rebecca. END
BEGIN NOW He's dead. END
BEGIN NOW You'll burn in hell. END
BEGIN NOW Hold him down. END
BEGIN NOW You know me, don't you? END
BEGIN NOW Are we dead, you and me? END
BEGIN NOW We're not dead, Pa. Pa? END
BEGIN NOW I should know you. END
BEGIN NOW Please don't laugh. END
BEGIN NOW I think you're my daughter. END
BEGIN NOW Claudia? END
BEGIN NOW Yes, it's me. END
BEGIN NOW I see you now. END
BEGIN NOW I see you clear enough. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, how you must hate me, child. END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW No, I love you. END
BEGIN NOW I love you. END
BEGIN NOW Where am I? END
BEGIN NOW Senor Lear. END
BEGIN NOW It's all right, Pa. How do you mean? END
BEGIN NOW What am I doing in his house? END
BEGIN NOW He helped rescue you. END
BEGIN NOW And he's been protecting me. END
BEGIN NOW The hell you say. END
BEGIN NOW He's the enemy of our blood. END
BEGIN NOW What the hell is going on? END
BEGIN NOW Senor, we are expecting an attack. END
BEGIN NOW An attack? END
BEGIN NOW Who from? END
BEGIN NOW Highsmith and my two other daughters. END
BEGIN NOW Sir, forgive our accommodations...\... but this is the safest place in the hacienda. END
BEGIN NOW Stay here. END
BEGIN NOW Senor. END
BEGIN NOW I'll stand with you. END
BEGIN NOW No, no, no. END
BEGIN NOW Stay with your daughter. END
BEGIN NOW You belong with her now. END
BEGIN NOW You men, help them finish loading that wagon. END
BEGIN NOW Hope your canteens are full. END
BEGIN NOW It is hotter than hell. END
BEGIN NOW Bring it up. END
BEGIN NOW There we go. END
BEGIN NOW Captain Tumlinson's due back any day. END
BEGIN NOW Don't concern yourself with my husband. END
BEGIN NOW When you get back, we'll take care of that together. END
BEGIN NOW Her husband ain't even been dead a week. END
BEGIN NOW Funny how some people are cold-hearted. END
BEGIN NOW All right, mount up. END
BEGIN NOW Let's go. END
BEGIN NOW What are we doing, Suzannah? END
BEGIN NOW What has become of us? END
BEGIN NOW Don't be softhearted, Rebecca. END
BEGIN NOW Not now. END
BEGIN NOW Anybody there? END
BEGIN NOW No! END
BEGIN NOW No, Pa. Leave me alone. END
BEGIN NOW Pa, it's me. END
BEGIN NOW It's Thomas. END
BEGIN NOW It's Thomas, Pa. Come on now, Pa. Thomas. END
BEGIN NOW You've come back. END
BEGIN NOW You're back. END
BEGIN NOW You're back. END
BEGIN NOW How could I ever thought you stole those horses? END
BEGIN NOW Why would Emmett do such a thing? END
BEGIN NOW So he could take what was rightfully yours. END
BEGIN NOW That's not enough for him anymore. END
BEGIN NOW What do you mean? END
BEGIN NOW I know he sent Highsmith that day. END
BEGIN NOW He knew what he would do. END
BEGIN NOW He knew well enough. END
BEGIN NOW Don't say that. END
BEGIN NOW I won't believe it. END
BEGIN NOW lt was Emmett, son. END
BEGIN NOW Then I'll kill him. END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW I was blind before. END
BEGIN NOW I couldn't see the hate in Emmett's heart. END
BEGIN NOW But you, you.... Will you forgive me? END
BEGIN NOW Hello, Enrique. END
BEGIN NOW Good to see you. END
BEGIN NOW Suzannah. END
BEGIN NOW Suzannah. END
BEGIN NOW Rebecca. END
BEGIN NOW You're back early. END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Where are all the men? END
BEGIN NOW Out on the campo. END
BEGIN NOW Doing what? END
BEGIN NOW Roundup's over, isn't it? END
BEGIN NOW There was a storm. END
BEGIN NOW Cattle scattered before the men could bring them in. END
BEGIN NOW Where's your husband? END
BEGIN NOW He was murdered. END
BEGIN NOW Murdered by one of the hands. END
BEGIN NOW We had his funeral two days ago. END
BEGIN NOW I can show you his grave, Henry. END
BEGIN NOW I want to speak to Lear. END
BEGIN NOW We don't know where he is. END
BEGIN NOW He disappeared. END
BEGIN NOW Then why are you sitting here? END
BEGIN NOW Why aren't you looking for him? END
BEGIN NOW It's Menchaca's, isn't it? END
BEGIN NOW You're too late. END
BEGIN NOW You're too late to stop it, Henry. END
BEGIN NOW But you're not too late to share in its success. END
BEGIN NOW Don't try to stand in our way. END
BEGIN NOW Go. END
BEGIN NOW Don't be afraid. END
BEGIN NOW You're with your father. END
BEGIN NOW Rip? END
BEGIN NOW Rip, I say. END
BEGIN NOW Bring me a damn rifle. END
BEGIN NOW Rip? END
BEGIN NOW Rip, come back here. END
BEGIN NOW Come back here, damn you! END
BEGIN NOW What you want now? END
BEGIN NOW Want your horse so you can ride after another storm? END
BEGIN NOW No, I wanna say something. END
BEGIN NOW Well, go on. END
BEGIN NOW Go on and say it. END
BEGIN NOW And quit staring at me like that. END
BEGIN NOW You look like you're about to squirt blood out of your eyes like a toad. END
BEGIN NOW What you got to say? END
BEGIN NOW Thank you, Rip. END
BEGIN NOW You ain't welcome. END
BEGIN NOW He must have got word that we was coming and skedaddled. END
BEGIN NOW They did. END
BEGIN NOW I thought Menchaca had more fight in him than that. END
BEGIN NOW What are we waiting for? END
BEGIN NOW There ain't nobody there. END
BEGIN NOW You take men, you go scout inside. END
BEGIN NOW You ! END
BEGIN NOW Ambush! END
BEGIN NOW Put down your weapons and you will live. END
BEGIN NOW Put them down! END
BEGIN NOW To hell with you! END
BEGIN NOW Bust those gates open, now! END
BEGIN NOW Fire. END
BEGIN NOW Fire. END
BEGIN NOW Look like the damn Alamo all over again. END
BEGIN NOW Through the gates! END
BEGIN NOW Through the gates! END
BEGIN NOW Get those gates open, now! END
BEGIN NOW Move it. END
BEGIN NOW Let's go! END
BEGIN NOW Fall back! END
BEGIN NOW Where's your father? END
BEGIN NOW No! END
BEGIN NOW That's enough. END
BEGIN NOW That's enough. END
BEGIN NOW Do you hear me, damn it? END
BEGIN NOW Pa! END
BEGIN NOW Stop it! END
BEGIN NOW Stop! END
BEGIN NOW Pa! END
BEGIN NOW No more! END
BEGIN NOW Hear me&mdash; Miss Claudia! END
BEGIN NOW Stop! END
BEGIN NOW Stop! END
BEGIN NOW Hold your fire! END
BEGIN NOW Pull back! END
BEGIN NOW Damn you. END
BEGIN NOW Murderers! END
BEGIN NOW Claudia. END
BEGIN NOW Claudia. END
BEGIN NOW Claudia. END
BEGIN NOW Rip. END
BEGIN NOW See? END
BEGIN NOW This feather stirs. END
BEGIN NOW She's breathing! END
BEGIN NOW She's alive! END
BEGIN NOW That ain't nothing but the wind. END
BEGIN NOW No, you're wrong, Rip. END
BEGIN NOW I know the difference. END
BEGIN NOW This is her breath. END
BEGIN NOW She's alive. END
BEGIN NOW But she's not, John. END
BEGIN NOW She's not. END
BEGIN NOW Look at him. END
BEGIN NOW He's alive. END
BEGIN NOW Not Claudia. END
BEGIN NOW She's dead as the ground. END
BEGIN NOW Look there. END
BEGIN NOW Look there. END
BEGIN NOW You did this. END
BEGIN NOW It needed doing. END
BEGIN NOW Where's Emmett? END
BEGIN NOW Rebecca...\...show some pride. END
BEGIN NOW I'll see you hang for this, and what you did to Westover. END
BEGIN NOW Will you? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW Leave her. END
BEGIN NOW Suzannah! END
BEGIN NOW Suzannah! END
BEGIN NOW Where's she going? END
BEGIN NOW Somebody tell me where she's going! END
BEGIN NOW Don't touch me. END
BEGIN NOW Where are you taking me? END
BEGIN NOW Mr. Tumlinson, where are they taking me? END
BEGIN NOW You hear that? END
BEGIN NOW What is it? END
BEGIN NOW It's that mountain lion. END
BEGIN NOW There ain't no mountain lion. END
BEGIN NOW Damn it, I heared it, didn't I? END
BEGIN NOW He's out there waiting for us to go to bed...\...so he can come here and kill one of our horses. END
BEGIN NOW He ain't gonna kill our horses. END
BEGIN NOW How do you know that? END
BEGIN NOW Because I'm out here, and I'll be keeping watch, Pa. END
BEGIN NOW I expect you will. END
BEGIN NOW I know you will, Thomas.  END
BEGIN NOW THE years come on, the years go by, And in my Northern valley I, Withdrawn from life, watch life go by. END
BEGIN NOW But I have formed within my heart A state that does not thus depart, Richer than life, greater than being, Truer in feeling and in seeing Than outward turbulence can know; Where time is still, like a large, slow And lofty bird that moves her wings In far, invisible flutterings To gaze on every part of space Yet poise for ever in one place; Where line and sound, colour and phrase Rebuild in clear, essential ways The powers behind the veil of sense; While tragic things are made intense By passion brooding on old dread, Till a faint light of beauty shed From night-enfolded agony Shews in the ways men fail and die The deeps whose knowledge never cloys But, striking inward without voice, Stirs me to tremble and rejoice. END
BEGIN NOW For twenty years and more than twenty I have found my riches and my plenty In poets dead and poets living, Painters and music-men, all giving, By life shut in creative deeds, Live force and insight to my needs; And long before I came to stand And hear your voice and touch your hand In that great treasure-house new-known, Where in their tower above the Town The masters of The Dial sit, I loved in every word of it Your finely tempered verse that told me Of patient power, and still can hold me By its authentic divination Of the right knowledge of creation, Its grave, still beauty brought to day Tissue by tissue in nature's way, Petal by petal sure to shew Imagination's quiet glow That burns intenseliest at the core. END
BEGIN NOW And through that twenty years and more I have been envious of your reach In speaking form and plastic speech, Your double energy of hand That puts two arts at your command While I must be content with one And feel true life but half begun; So that by graver as by pen You can create earth, stars, and men, And prove yourself by more than rime A prince of poets in our time. END
BEGIN NOW For these delights, and the delight Of converse in a Surrey night After the deep sound had lapsed by Of ocean-haunted poetry, For counsel and another zest Added to beauty's life-long quest I, in acknowledgment, would bring The homage of an offering; And, being too poor to reach the height Of my conception or requite Your greater giving equally, I search in my capacity And, by my self-appointed trade, Find something I myself have made, That here I offer. END
BEGIN NOW Let it be A token betwixt you and me Of admiration and loyalty. END
BEGIN NOW February th, The scene is a bedchamber in a one-storied house. END
BEGIN NOW The walls consist of a few courses of huge irregular boulders roughly squared and fitted together; a thatched roof rises steeply from the back wall. END
BEGIN NOW In the centre of the back wall is a doorway opening on a garden and covered by two leather curtains; the chamber is partially hung with similar hangings stitched with bright wools. END
BEGIN NOW There is a small window on each side of this door. END
BEGIN NOW Toward the front a bed stands with its head against the right wall; it has thin leather curtains hung by thongs and drawn back. END
BEGIN NOW Farther forward a rich robe and a crown hang on a peg in the same wall. END
BEGIN NOW There is a second door beyond the bed, and between this and the bed's head stands a small table with a bronze lamp and a bronze cup on it. END
BEGIN NOW Queen MANY, many must die who long to live, Yet this one cannot die who longs to die: Even her sleep, come now at last, thwarts death, Although sleep lures us all half way to death.... END
BEGIN NOW I could not sit beside her every night If I believed that I might suffer so: I am sure I am not made to be diseased, I feel there is no malady can touch me— Save the red cancer, growing where it will. END
BEGIN NOW Taking her beads from her girdle, she kneels at the foot of the bed. END
BEGIN NOW O sweet Saint Cleer, and sweet Saint Elid too, Shield me from rooting cancers and from madness: Shield me from sudden death, worse than two death-beds; Let me not lie like this unwanted queen, Yet let my time come not ere I am ready— Grant space enow to relish the watchers' tears And give my clothes away and calm my features And streek my limbs according to my will, Not the hard will of fumbling corpse-washers. END
BEGIN NOW She prays silently. END
BEGIN NOW King Lear, a great, golden-bearded man in the full maturity of life, enters abruptly by the door beyond the bed, followed by the Why are you here? END
BEGIN NOW Are you here for ever? END
BEGIN NOW Where is the young Scotswoman? END
BEGIN NOW Where is she? END
BEGIN NOW O, Sire, move softly; the Queen sleeps at last. END
BEGIN NOW Lear, continuing in an undertone. END
BEGIN NOW Where is the young Scotswoman? END
BEGIN NOW Where is Gormflaith? END
BEGIN NOW It is her watch.... END
BEGIN NOW I know; I have marked your hours. END
BEGIN NOW Did the Queen send her away? END
BEGIN NOW Did the Queen Bid you stay near her in her hate of Gormflaith? END
BEGIN NOW You work upon her yeasting brain to think That she's not safe except when you crouch near her To spy with your dropt eyes and soundless presence. END
BEGIN NOW Sire, midnight should have ended Gormflaith's watch, But Gormflaith had another kind of will And ended at a godlier hour by slumber, A letter in her hand, the night-lamp out. END
BEGIN NOW She loitered in the hall when she should sleep. END
BEGIN NOW My duty has two hours ere she returns. END
BEGIN NOW The Queen should have young women about her bed, Fresh cool-breathed women to lie down at her side And plenish her with vigour; for sick or wasted women Can draw a virtue from such abounding presence, When night makes life unwary and looses the strings of being, Even by the breath, and most of all by sleep. END
BEGIN NOW Her slumber was then no fault: go you and find her. END
BEGIN NOW It is not strange that a bought watcher drowses; What is most strange is that the Queen sleeps Who would not sleep for all my draughts of sleep In the last days. END
BEGIN NOW When did this change appear? END
BEGIN NOW We shall not know—it came while When I awoke her and she saw the Queen She could not speak for fear: When the rekindling lamp showed certainly The bed-clothes stirring about our lady's neck, She knew there was no death, she breathed, she said She had not slept until her mistress slept And lulled her; but I asked her how her mistress Slept, and her utterance faded. END
BEGIN NOW She should be blamed with rods, as I was blamed For slumber, after a day and a night of watching, By the Queen's child-bed, twenty years ago. END
BEGIN NOW She does what she must do: let her alone. END
BEGIN NOW I know her watch is now: get gone and send her. END
BEGIN NOW Is it a portent now to sleep at night? END
BEGIN NOW What change is here? END
BEGIN NOW What see you in the Queen? END
BEGIN NOW Can you discern how this disease will end? END
BEGIN NOW Surmise might spring and healing follow yet, If I could find a trouble that could heal; But these strong inward pains that keep her ebbing Have not their source in perishing flesh. END
BEGIN NOW I have seen women creep into their beds And sink with this blind pain because they nursed Some bitterness or burden in the mind That drew the life, sucklings too long at breast. END
BEGIN NOW Do you know such a cause in this poor lady? END
BEGIN NOW There is no cause. END
BEGIN NOW How should there be a cause? END
BEGIN NOW We cannot die wholly against our wills; And in the texture of women I have found Harder determination than in men: The body grows impatient of enduring, The harried mind is from the body estranged, And we consent to go: by the Queen's touch, The way she moves—or does not move—in bed, The eyes so cold and keen in her white mask, I know she has consented. END
BEGIN NOW The snarling look of a mute wounded hawk, That would be let alone, is always hers— Yet she was sorely tender: it may be Some wound in her affection will not heal. END
BEGIN NOW We should be careful—the mind can so be hurt That nought can make it be unhurt again. END
BEGIN NOW Where, then, did her affection most persist? END
BEGIN NOW Old bone-patcher, old digger in men's flesh, Doctors are ever itching to be priests, Meddling in conduct, natures, life's privacies. END
BEGIN NOW We have been coupled now for twenty years, And she has never turned from me an hour— She knows a woman's duty and a queen's: Whose, then, can her affection be but mine? END
BEGIN NOW How can I hurt her—she is still my queen? END
BEGIN NOW If her strong inward pain is a real pain Find me some certain drug to medicine it: When common beings have decayed past help, There must be still some drug for a king to use; For nothing ought to be denied to kings. END
BEGIN NOW For the mere anguish there is such a potion. END
BEGIN NOW The gum of warpy juniper shoots is seethed With the torn marrow of an adder's spine; An unflawed emerald is pashed to dust And mingled there; that broth must cool in moonlight. END
BEGIN NOW I have indeed attempted this already, But the poor emeralds I could extort From wry-mouthed earls' women had no force. END
BEGIN NOW In two more dawns it will be late for potions.... END
BEGIN NOW There are not many emeralds in Britain, And there is none for vividness and strength Like the great stone that hangs upon your breast: If you will waste it for her she shall be holpen. END
BEGIN NOW Lear, with rising voice. END
BEGIN NOW Shatter my emerald? END
BEGIN NOW My emerald? END
BEGIN NOW My emerald? END
BEGIN NOW A High King of Eire gave it to his daughter Who mothered generations of us, the kings of Britain; It has a spiritual influence; its heart Burns when it sees the sun.... Shatter my emerald! END
BEGIN NOW Only the fungused brain and carious mouth Of senile things could shape such thought.... My emerald! END
BEGIN NOW Speak lower, low; for your good fame, speak low— If she should waken thus.... Lear. END
BEGIN NOW There is no wise man Believes that medicine is in a jewel. END
BEGIN NOW It is enough that you have failed with one. END
BEGIN NOW Seek you a common stone. END
BEGIN NOW I'll not do it. END
BEGIN NOW Let her eat heartily: she is spent with fasting. END
BEGIN NOW Let her stand up and walk: she is so still Her blood can never nourish her. END
BEGIN NOW Come away. END
BEGIN NOW I must not leave her ere the woman comes— Or will some other woman.... Lear. END
BEGIN NOW No, no, no, no; The Queen is not herself; she speaks without sense; Only She is better quiet. END
BEGIN NOW Come.... END
BEGIN NOW He urges the My emerald! END
BEGIN NOW He follows the Queen I have not slept; I did but close mine eyes A little while—a little while forgetting.... Where are you, Bring me the cup of whey, woman; I thirst.... Will you speak to me if I say your name? END
BEGIN NOW Will you not listen, Can you hear? END
BEGIN NOW I am very thirsty—let me drink.... Ah, wicked woman, why did I speak to you? END
BEGIN NOW I will not be your suppliant again.... Where are you? END
BEGIN NOW O, where are you?... END
BEGIN NOW Where are you? END
BEGIN NOW She tries to raise herself to look about the room, but sinks back helplessly. END
BEGIN NOW The curtains of the door at the back are parted, and Mother, were you calling? END
BEGIN NOW Have I awakened you? END
BEGIN NOW They said that you were sleeping. END
BEGIN NOW Why are you left alone, mother, my dear one? END
BEGIN NOW Who are you? END
BEGIN NOW No, no, no! END
BEGIN NOW Stand farther off! END
BEGIN NOW You pulse and glow; you are too vital; your presence hurts.... Freshness of hill-swards, wind and trodden ling, I should have known that It is yet dawn, but you have been afoot Afar and long: where could you climb so soon? END
BEGIN NOW Dearest, I am an evil daughter to you: I never thought of you—O, never once— Until I heard a moor-bird cry like you. END
BEGIN NOW I am wicked, rapt in joys of breath and life, And I must force myself to think of you. END
BEGIN NOW I leave you to caretakers' cold gentleness; But O, I did not think that they dare leave you. END
BEGIN NOW What woman should be here? END
BEGIN NOW I know not.... She will be about some duty. END
BEGIN NOW I do not matter: my time is done\... nigh done\... Bought hands can well prepare me for a grave, And all the generations must serve youth. END
BEGIN NOW My girls shall live untroubled while they may, And learn happiness once while yet blind men Have injured not their freedom; For women are not meant for happiness. END
BEGIN NOW Where have you been, my falcon? END
BEGIN NOW I dreamt that I was swimming, shoulder up, And drave the bed-clothes spreading to the floor: Coldness awoke me; through the waning darkness I heard far hounds give shivering aëry tongue, Remote, withdrawing, suddenly faint and near; I leapt and saw a pack of stretching weasels Hunt a pale coney in a soundless rush, Their elfin and thin yelping pierced my heart As with an unseen beauty long awaited; Wolf-skin and cloak I buckled over this night-gear, And took my honoured spear from my bed-side Where none but I may touch its purity, And sped as lightly down the dewy bank As any mothy owl that hunts quick mice. END
BEGIN NOW They went crying, crying, but I lost them Before I stept, with the first tips of light, On Raven Crag near by the Druid Stones; So I paused there and, stooping, pressed my hand Against the stony bed of the clear stream; Then entered I the circle and raised up My shining hand in cold stern adoration Even as the first great gleam went up the sky. END
BEGIN NOW Ay, you do well to worship on that height: Life is free to the quick up in the wind, And the wind bares you for a god's descent— For wind is a spirit immediate and aged. END
BEGIN NOW And you do well to worship harsh men-gods, God Wind and Those who built his Stones with him: All gods are cruel, bitter, and to be bribed, But women-gods are mean and cunning as well. END
BEGIN NOW That fierce old virgin, Cornish Merryn, prays To a young woman, yes and even a virgin— The poorest kind of woman—and she says That is to be a Christian: avoid then Her worship most, for men hate such denials, And any woman scorns her unwed daughter. END
BEGIN NOW Where sped you from that height? END
BEGIN NOW Did Regan join you there? END
BEGIN NOW Does Regan worship anywhere at dawn? END
BEGIN NOW The sweaty half-clad cook-maids render lard Out in the scullery, after pig-killing, And Regan sidles among their greasy skirts, Smeary and hot as they, for craps to suck. END
BEGIN NOW I lost my thoughts before the giant Stones... And when anew the earth assembled round me I swung out on the heath and woke a hare And speared it at a cast and shouldered it, Startled another drinking at a tarn And speared it ere it leapt; so steady and clear Had the god in his fastness made my mind. END
BEGIN NOW Then, as I took those dead things in my hands, I felt shame light my face from deep within, And loathing and contempt shake in my bowels, That such unclean coarse blows from me had issued To crush delicate things to bloody mash And blemish their fur when I would only kill. END
BEGIN NOW My gladness left me; I careered no more Upon the morning; I went down from there With empty hands: But under the first trees and without thought I stole on conies at play and stooped at one; I hunted it, I caught it up to me As I outsprang it, and with this thin knife Pierced it from eye to eye; and it was dead, Untorn, unsullied, and with flawless fur. END
BEGIN NOW Then my untroubled mind came back to me. END
BEGIN NOW Leap down the glades with a fawn's ignorance; Live you your fill of a harsh purity; Be wild and calm and lonely while you may. END
BEGIN NOW These are your nature's joys, and it is human Only to recognize our natures' joys When we are losing them for ever. END
BEGIN NOW But why Do you say this to me with a sore heart? END
BEGIN NOW You are a queen, and speak from the top of life, And when you choose to wish for others' joys Those others must have woe. END
BEGIN NOW The hour comes for you to turn to a man And give yourself with the high heart of youth More lavishly than a queen gives anything. END
BEGIN NOW But when a woman gives herself She must give herself for ever and have faith; For woman is a thing of a season of years, She is an early fruit that will not keep, She can be drained and as a husk survive To hope for reverence for what has been; While man renews himself into old age, And gives himself according to his need, And women more unborn than his next child May take him yet with youth And lose him with their potence. END
BEGIN NOW But women need not wed these men. END
BEGIN NOW We are good human currency, like gold, For men to pass among them when they choose. END
BEGIN NOW A child's hands beat on the outside of the door beyond the bed. END
BEGIN NOW Father.... Father.... Father.... Are you here? END
BEGIN NOW I know my father is here.... END
BEGIN NOW I want him.... Now.... END
BEGIN NOW Mother, chide My little curse. END
BEGIN NOW Send her away—away.... Father.... O, father, father.... END
BEGIN NOW I want my father. END
BEGIN NOW Hush; hush—you hurt your mother with your voice. END
BEGIN NOW You cannot come in, Cordeil; you must go away: Your father is not here.... END
BEGIN NOW He must be here: He is not in his chamber or the hall, He is not in the stable or with Gormflaith: He promised I should ride with him at dawn And sit before his saddle and hold his hawk, And ride with him and ride to the heron-marsh; He said that he would give me the first heron, And hang the longest feathers in my hair. END
BEGIN NOW Then you must haste to find him; He may be riding now.... END
BEGIN NOW But Gerda said she saw him enter here. END
BEGIN NOW Indeed, he is not here.... You are too noisy. END
BEGIN NOW Must I make you go? END
BEGIN NOW Mother, Go, go, thou evil child, thou ill-comer. END
BEGIN NOW Though she is wilful, obeying only the King, She is a very little child, mother, To be so bitterly thought of. END
BEGIN NOW Because a woman gives herself for ever Cordeil the useless had to be conceived (Like an after-thought that deceives nobody) To keep her father from another woman. END
BEGIN NOW And I lie here. END
BEGIN NOW Hard and unjust my father has been to me; Yet that has knitted up within my mind A love of coldness and a love of him Who makes me firm, wary, swift and secret, Until I feel if I become a mother I shall at need be cruel to my children, And ever cold, to string their natures harder And make them able to endure men's deeds; But now I wonder if injustice Keeps house with baseness, taught by kinship— I never thought a king could be untrue, I never thought my father was unclean.... O mother, mother, what is it? END
BEGIN NOW Is this dying? END
BEGIN NOW I think I am only faint.... Give me the cup of whey.... END
BEGIN NOW There is too little here. END
BEGIN NOW When was it made? END
BEGIN NOW Yester-eve.... Yester-morn.... END
BEGIN NOW Unhappy mother, You have no daughter to take thought for you— No servant's love to shame a daughter with, Though I am shamed—you must have other food, Straightway I bring you meat.... Plenish the cup for me.... Not now, not now, But in a while; for I am heavy now.... Old Wynoc's potions loiter in my veins, And tides of heaviness pour over me Each time I wake and think. END
BEGIN NOW I could sleep now. END
BEGIN NOW Then I shall lull you, as you once lulled me. END
BEGIN NOW Seating herself on the bed, she sings. END
BEGIN NOW The owlets in roof-holes Can sing for themselves; The smallest brown squirrel Both scampers and delves; But a baby does nothing— She never knows how— She must hark to her mother Who sings to her now. END
BEGIN NOW Sleep then, ladykin, peeping so; Hide your handies and ley lei lo. END
BEGIN NOW She bends over The lish baby otter Is sleeky and streaming, With catching bright fishes, Ere babies learn dreaming; But no wet little otter Is ever so warm As the fleecy-wrapt baby 'Twixt me and my arm. END
BEGIN NOW Sleep big mousie.... Be quiet.... END
BEGIN NOW I cannot bear it. END
BEGIN NOW She turns her head away from As Why did you leave the Queen? END
BEGIN NOW Where have you been? END
BEGIN NOW Why have you so neglected this grave duty? END
BEGIN NOW This is the instant of my duty, Princess: From midnight until now was I thought to find her here: is she not here? END
BEGIN NOW I found the Queen alone. END
BEGIN NOW I heard her cry your name. END
BEGIN NOW Your anger is not too great, Madam; I grieve That one so old as Merryn should act thus— So old and trusted and favoured, and so callous. END
BEGIN NOW The Queen has had no food since yester-night. END
BEGIN NOW Madam, that is too monstrous to conceive: I will seek food—I will prepare it now. END
BEGIN NOW Stay here: and know, if the Queen is left again, You shall be beaten with two rods at once. END
BEGIN NOW She picks up the cup and goes out by the door beyond the bed. END
BEGIN NOW Open your window when the moon is dead, And I will come again. END
BEGIN NOW The men say everywhere that you are faithless, The women say your face is a false face And your eyes shifty eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Ah, but I love you, Do not forget your window-latch to-night, For when the moon is dead the house is still. END
BEGIN NOW Lear again parts the door-curtains at the back, and, seeing Lady, what do you read? END
BEGIN NOW A letter—a letter—what read you in a letter? END
BEGIN NOW Your words to me—my lonely joy your words.... END
BEGIN NOW If you are steady and true as your gaze — Lear, tearing the letter from her, crumpling it, and flinging it to the back of the room. END
BEGIN NOW Pest! END
BEGIN NOW You should not carry a king's letters about, Nor hoard a king's letters. END
BEGIN NOW Must the King also stand in the presence now? END
BEGIN NOW Pardon my troubled mind; you have taken my letter from me. END
BEGIN NOW Lear seats himself and takes Wait, wait—I might be seen. END
BEGIN NOW The Queen may waken yet. END
BEGIN NOW Stepping lightly to the bed, she noiselessly slips the curtain on that side as far forward as it will come. END
BEGIN NOW Then she returns to Lear, who draws her to him and seats her on his knee. END
BEGIN NOW You have been long in coming: Was Merryn long in finding you? END
BEGIN NOW Did Has She loitered long before she came, For I was at the women's bathing-place ere dawn.... No jewel in all the land excites me and enthralls Like this strong source of light that lives upon your breast. END
BEGIN NOW Lear, taking the jewel-chain from his neck and slipping it over Wear it within your breast to fill the gentle place That cherished the poor letter lately torn from you. END
BEGIN NOW Did Merryn at your bidding, then, forsake her Queen? END
BEGIN NOW You must not, ah, you must not do these masterful things, Even to grasp a precious meeting for us two; For the reproach and chiding are so hard to me, And even you can never fight the silent women In hidden league against me, all this house of women. END
BEGIN NOW Merryn has left her Queen in unwatched loneliness, And yet your daughter Princess Goneril has said (With lips that scarce held back the spittle for my face) That if the Queen is left again I shall be whipt. END
BEGIN NOW Children speak of the punishments they know. END
BEGIN NOW Her back is now not half so white as yours, And you shall write your will upon it yet. END
BEGIN NOW Ah, no, my King, my faithful... Ah, no... no... END
BEGIN NOW The Princess Goneril is right; she judges me: A sinful woman cannot steadily gaze reply To the cool, baffling looks of virgin untried force. END
BEGIN NOW She stands beside that crumbling mother in her hate, And, though we know so well—she and I, O we know— That she could love no mother nor partake in anguish, Yet she is flouted when the King forsakes her dam, She must protect her very flesh, her tenderer flesh, Although she cannot wince; she's wild in her cold brain, And soon I must be made to pay a cruel price For this one gloomy joy in my uncherished life. END
BEGIN NOW Envy and greed are watching me aloof (Yes, now none of the women will walk with me), Longing to see me ruined, but she'll do it.... END
BEGIN NOW It is a lonely thing to love a king.... She puts her cheek gradually closer and closer to Lear's cheek as she speaks: at length he kisses her suddenly and vehemently, as if he would grasp her lips with his: she receives it passively, her head thrown back, her eyes closed. END
BEGIN NOW Goldilocks, when the crown is couching in your hair And those two mingled golds brighten each other's wonder, You shall produce a son from flesh unused— Virgin I chose you for that, first crops are strongest— A tawny fox with your high-stepping action, With your untiring power and glittering eyes, To hold my lands together when I am done, To keep my lands from crumbling into mouthfuls For the short jaws of my three mewling vixens. END
BEGIN NOW Hatch for me such a youngster from my seed, And I and he shall rein my hot-breathed wenches To let you grind the edges off their teeth. END
BEGIN NOW Life holds no more than this for me; this is my hour. END
BEGIN NOW When she is dead I know you'll buy another Queen— Giving a county for her, gaining a duchy with her— And put me to wet nursing, leashing me with the thralls. END
BEGIN NOW It will not be unbearable—I've had your love. END
BEGIN NOW Master and friend, grant then this hour to me: Never again, maybe, can we two sit At love together, unwatched, unknown of all, In the Queen's chamber, near the Queen's crown And with no conscious Queen to hold it from us: Now let me wear the Queen's true crown on me And snatch a breathless knowledge of the feeling Of what it would have been to sit by you Always and closely, equal and exalted, To be my light when life is dark again. END
BEGIN NOW Girl, by the black stone god, I did not think You had the nature of a chambermaid, Who pries and fumbles in her lady's clothes With her red hands, or on her soily neck Stealthily hangs her lady's jewels or pearls. END
BEGIN NOW You shall be tiring-maid to the next queen And try her crown on every day o' your life In secrecy, if that is your desire: If you would be a queen, cleanse yourself quickly Of menial fingering and servile thought. END
BEGIN NOW You need not crown me. END
BEGIN NOW Let me put it on As briefly as a gleam of Winter sun. END
BEGIN NOW I will not even warm it with my hair. END
BEGIN NOW You cannot have the nature of a queen If you believe that there are things above you: Crowns make no queens, queens are the cause of crowns. END
BEGIN NOW Then I will take one. END
BEGIN NOW Look. END
BEGIN NOW She tip-toes lightly round the front of the bed to where the crown hangs on the wall. END
BEGIN NOW Come here, mad thing—come back! END
BEGIN NOW Your shadow will wake the Queen. END
BEGIN NOW Hush, hush! END
BEGIN NOW That angry voice Will surely wake the Queen. END
BEGIN NOW She lifts the crown from the peg, and returns with it. END
BEGIN NOW Go back; bear back the crown: Hang up the crown again. END
BEGIN NOW We are not helpless serfs To think things are forbidden And steal them for our joy. END
BEGIN NOW Hush! END
BEGIN NOW Hush! END
BEGIN NOW It is too late; I dare not go again. END
BEGIN NOW Put down the crown: your hands are base hands yet. END
BEGIN NOW Give it to me: it issues from my hands. END
BEGIN NOW Let anger keep your eyes steady and bright To be my guiding mirror: do not move. END
BEGIN NOW You have received two queens within your eyes. END
BEGIN NOW She laughs clearly, like a bird's sudden song. END
BEGIN NOW Doff it. END
BEGIN NOW ( (Kiss) Unless you do (Kiss) my will (Kiss) I shall (Kiss) I shall (Kiss) I'll have you (Kiss) sent (Kiss) to (Kiss)—— Come to the garden: you shall hear me there. END
BEGIN NOW I dare not leave the Queen.... END
BEGIN NOW Yes, yes, I come. END
BEGIN NOW No, you are better here: the guard would see you. END
BEGIN NOW Not when we reach the pathway near the apple-yard. END
BEGIN NOW They rise. END
BEGIN NOW Girl, you are changed: you yield more beauty so. END
BEGIN NOW They go out hand in hand by the doorway at the back. END
BEGIN NOW As they pass the crumpled letter How have they vanished? END
BEGIN NOW What are they doing now? END
BEGIN NOW If you have a mind to kiss me You shall kiss me in the dark: Yet rehearse, or you might miss me— Make my mouth your noontide mark.... END
BEGIN NOW Does he remember love-ways used with me? END
BEGIN NOW Shall I never know? END
BEGIN NOW Is it too near? END
BEGIN NOW I'll watch him at his wooing once again, Though I peer up at him across my grave-sill. END
BEGIN NOW She gets out of bed and takes several steps toward the garden doorway; she totters and sways, then, turning, stumbles back to the bed for support. END
BEGIN NOW Limbs, will you die? END
BEGIN NOW It is not yet the time. END
BEGIN NOW I know more discipline: I'll make you go. END
BEGIN NOW She fumbles along the bed to the head, then, clinging against the wall, drags herself toward the back of the room. END
BEGIN NOW It is too far. END
BEGIN NOW I cannot see the wall. END
BEGIN NOW I will go ten more steps: only ten more. END
BEGIN NOW One. END
BEGIN NOW Two. END
BEGIN NOW Three. END
BEGIN NOW Four. END
BEGIN NOW Five. END
BEGIN NOW Six. END
BEGIN NOW Seven. END
BEGIN NOW Eight. END
BEGIN NOW Nine. END
BEGIN NOW Ten. END
BEGIN NOW Sundown is soon to-day: it is cold and dark. END
BEGIN NOW Now ten steps more, and much will have been done. END
BEGIN NOW One. END
BEGIN NOW Two. END
BEGIN NOW Three. END
BEGIN NOW Four. END
BEGIN NOW Ten. END
BEGIN NOW Eleven. END
BEGIN NOW Twelve. END
BEGIN NOW Sixteen. END
BEGIN NOW Nineteen. END
BEGIN NOW Twenty. END
BEGIN NOW Twenty-one. END
BEGIN NOW Twenty-three. END
BEGIN NOW Twenty-eight. END
BEGIN NOW Thirty. END
BEGIN NOW Thirty-one. END
BEGIN NOW At last the turn. END
BEGIN NOW Thirty-six. END
BEGIN NOW Thirty-nine. END
BEGIN NOW Forty. END
BEGIN NOW Now only once again. END
BEGIN NOW Two. END
BEGIN NOW Three. END
BEGIN NOW What do the voices say? END
BEGIN NOW I hear too many. END
BEGIN NOW The door: but here there is no garden.... Ah! END
BEGIN NOW She holds herself up an instant by the door-curtains; then she reels and falls, her body in the room, her head and shoulders beyond the curtains. END
BEGIN NOW Where are you? END
BEGIN NOW What have you done? END
BEGIN NOW Speak to me. END
BEGIN NOW Turning and seeing Mother, O mother! END
BEGIN NOW She goes to Princess, what has she done? END
BEGIN NOW Who has left her? END
BEGIN NOW She must have been alone. END
BEGIN NOW Where is Gormflaith? END
BEGIN NOW Mercy o' mercies, everybody asks me For Gormflaith, then for Gormflaith, then for Gormflaith, And I ask everybody else for her; But she is nowhere, and the King will foam. END
BEGIN NOW Send me no more; I am old with running about After a bodiless name. END
BEGIN NOW She has been here, And she has left the Queen. END
BEGIN NOW This is her deed. END
BEGIN NOW Ah, cruel, cruel! END
BEGIN NOW The shame, the pity— Together they raise She breathes, but something flitters under her flesh: Wynoc the leech must help us now. END
BEGIN NOW Go, run, Seek him, and come back quickly, and do not dare To come without him. END
BEGIN NOW It is useless, lady: There's fever at the cowherd's in the marsh, And Wynoc broods above it twice a day, And I have lately seen him hobble thither. END
BEGIN NOW I never heard such scornful wickedness As that a king's physician so should choose To watch and even heal base men and poor— And, more than all, when there's a queen a-dying.... Whence come you, dearest daughter? END
BEGIN NOW What have I done? END
BEGIN NOW Are you a dream? END
BEGIN NOW I thought I was alone. END
BEGIN NOW Have you been hunting on the Windy Height? END
BEGIN NOW Your hands are not thus gentle after hunting. END
BEGIN NOW Or have I heard you singing through my sleep? END
BEGIN NOW Stay with me now: I have had piercing thoughts Of what the ways of life will do to you To mould and maim you, and I have a power To bring these to expression that I knew not. END
BEGIN NOW Why do you wear my crown? END
BEGIN NOW Why do you wear My crown I say? END
BEGIN NOW Why do you wear my crown? END
BEGIN NOW I am falling, falling! END
BEGIN NOW Lift me: hold me up. END
BEGIN NOW It is the bed that breaks, for still I sink. END
BEGIN NOW Grip harder: I am slipping! END
BEGIN NOW Woman, help! END
BEGIN NOW Why is the King's mother standing there? END
BEGIN NOW She should not wear her crown before me now. END
BEGIN NOW Send her away, she had a savage mind. END
BEGIN NOW Will you not hang a shawl across the corner So that she cannot stare at me again? END
BEGIN NOW With a rending sob she buries her face in Ah, she is coming! END
BEGIN NOW Do not let her touch me! END
BEGIN NOW Brave splendid daughter, how easily you save me: But soon will O, will she bring my crown to me once more? END
BEGIN NOW Yes, Gormflaith has left you lonely: 'Tis No, Everything.... Pay Her head falls back over Send horsemen to the marshes for the leech, And let them bind him on a horse's back And bring him swiftlier than an old man rides. END
BEGIN NOW This is no leech's work: she 's a dead woman. END
BEGIN NOW I'd best be finding if the wisdom-women Have come from Brita's child-bed to their drinking By the cook's fire, for soon she'll be past handling. END
BEGIN NOW This is not death: death could not be like this. END
BEGIN NOW She is quite warm—though nothing moves in her. END
BEGIN NOW I did not know death could come all at once: If life is so ill-seated no one is safe. END
BEGIN NOW Cannot we leave her like herself awhile? END
BEGIN NOW Wait awhile, No, no, no; not yet! END
BEGIN NOW Child, she is gone and will not come again However we cover our faces and pretend She will be there if we uncover them. END
BEGIN NOW I must be hasty, or she'll be as stiff As a straw mattress is. END
BEGIN NOW She hurries out by the door near the bed. END
BEGIN NOW Come back, come back; the things I have not done Beat in upon my brain from every side: I know not where to put myself to bear them: If I could have you now I could act well. END
BEGIN NOW My inward life, deeds that you have not known, I burn to tell you in a sudden dread That now your ghost discovers them in me. END
BEGIN NOW Hearken, mother; between us there 's a bond Of flesh and essence closer than love can cause: It cannot be unknit so soon as this, And you must know my touch, And you shall yield a sign. END
BEGIN NOW Feel, feel this urging throb: I call to you. END
BEGIN NOW Come back. END
BEGIN NOW Come back! END
BEGIN NOW Help me and shield me! END
BEGIN NOW She disappears through the curtains. END
BEGIN NOW Lear enters by the garden doorway, leading Lear. END
BEGIN NOW What is to do? END
BEGIN NOW O, Sir, the Queen is dead: long live the Queen. END
BEGIN NOW You have been ready with the coronation. END
BEGIN NOW What do you mean? END
BEGIN NOW Young madam, will you mock? END
BEGIN NOW But is not she your choice? END
BEGIN NOW The old Queen thought so, for I found her here, Lipping the prints of her supplanter's feet, Prostrate in homage, on her face, silent. END
BEGIN NOW I tremble within to have seen her fallen down. END
BEGIN NOW I must be pardoned if I scorn your ways: You cannot know this feeling that I know, You are not of her kin or house; but I Share blood with her, and, though she grew too worn To be your Queen, she was my mother, Sir. END
BEGIN NOW The Queen has seen me. END
BEGIN NOW She is safe in bed. END
BEGIN NOW Do not speak low: your voice sounds guilty so; And there is no more need—she will not wake. END
BEGIN NOW She cannot sleep for ever. END
BEGIN NOW When she wakes I will announce my purpose in the need Of Britain for a prince to follow me, And tell her that she is to be deposed.... What have you done? END
BEGIN NOW She is not breathing now. END
BEGIN NOW She breathed here lately. END
BEGIN NOW Is she truly dead? END
BEGIN NOW Your graceful consort steals from us too soon: Will you not tell her that she should remain— If she can trust the faith you keep with a queen? END
BEGIN NOW She steps to Lady, why will you go? END
BEGIN NOW The King intends That you shall soon be royal, and thereby Admitted to our breed: then stay with us In this domestic privacy to mourn The grief here fallen on our family. END
BEGIN NOW Kneel now; I yield the eldest daughter's place. END
BEGIN NOW Why do you fumble in your bosom so? END
BEGIN NOW Put your cold hands together; close your eyes, In inward isolation to assemble Your memories of the dead, your prayers for her. END
BEGIN NOW She turns to Lear, who has approached the bed and drawn back the curtain. END
BEGIN NOW What utterance of doom would the king use Upon a watchman in the castle garth Who left his gate and let an enemy in? END
BEGIN NOW The watcher by the Queen thus left her station: The sick bruised Queen is dead of that neglect. END
BEGIN NOW And what should be the doom on a seducer Who drew that sentinel from his fixt watch? END
BEGIN NOW She had long been dying, and she would have died Had all her dutiful daughters tended her bed. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, she had long been dying in her heart. END
BEGIN NOW She lived to see you give her crown away; She died to see you fondle a menial: These blows you dealt now, but what elder wounds Received them to such purpose suddenly? END
BEGIN NOW What had you caused her to remember most? END
BEGIN NOW What things would she be like to babble over In the wild helpless hour when fitful life No more can choose what thoughts it shall encourage In the tost mind? END
BEGIN NOW She has suffered you twice over, Your animal thoughts and hungry powers, this day, Until I knew you unkingly and untrue. END
BEGIN NOW Punishment once taught you daughterly silence; It shall be tried again.... What has she said? END
BEGIN NOW You cannot touch me now I know your nature: Your force upon my mind was only terrible When I believed you a cruel flawless man. END
BEGIN NOW Ruler of lands and dreaded judge of men, Now you have done a murder with your mind Can you see any murderer put to death? END
BEGIN NOW Can you— Lear. END
BEGIN NOW What has she said? END
BEGIN NOW Continue in your joy of punishing evil, Your passion of just revenge upon wrong-doers, Unkingly and untrue? END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Enough: what do you know? END
BEGIN NOW That which could add a further agony To the last agony, the daily poison Of her late, withering life; but never word Of fairer hours or any lost delight. END
BEGIN NOW Have you no memory, either, of her youth, While she was still to use, spoil, forsake, That maims your new contentment with a longing For what is gone and will not come again? END
BEGIN NOW I did not know that she could die to-day. END
BEGIN NOW She had a bloodless beauty that cheated me: She was not born for wedlock. END
BEGIN NOW She shut me out. END
BEGIN NOW She is no colder now.... END
BEGIN NOW I'll hear no more. END
BEGIN NOW You shall be answered afterward for this. END
BEGIN NOW Put something over her: get her buried: I will not look on her again. END
BEGIN NOW He breaks from My King, you leave me! END
BEGIN NOW Soon we follow him: But, ah, poor fragile beauty, you cannot rise While this grave burden weights your drooping head. END

BEGIN NOW Lo, how you sink and fail. END
BEGIN NOW You had best take care, For where my neck has bruises yours shall have wounds. END
BEGIN NOW The King knows of your wolfish snapping at me: He will protect me. END
BEGIN NOW Take it and let me go! END
BEGIN NOW Nay, not to me: You are the Queen's, to serve her even in death. END
BEGIN NOW Yield her her own. END
BEGIN NOW Approach her: do not fear; She will not chide you or forgive you now. END
BEGIN NOW Go on your knees; the crown still holds you down. END
BEGIN NOW Mother and Queen, to you this holiest circlet Returns, by you renews its purpose and pride; Though it is sullied with a menial warmth, Your august coldness shall rehallow it, And when the young lewd blood that lent it heat Is also cooler we can well forget. END
BEGIN NOW She steps to Rise. END
BEGIN NOW Come, for here there is no more to do, And let us seek your chamber, if you will, There to confer in greater privacy; For we have now interment to prepare. END
BEGIN NOW She leads You must walk first, you are still the Queen elect. END
BEGIN NOW When What will you do? END
BEGIN NOW On. END
BEGIN NOW On. END
BEGIN NOW On. END
BEGIN NOW Go in. END
BEGIN NOW She follows After a moments interval two elderly women, one a little younger than the other, enter by the same door: they wear black hoods and shapeless black gowns with large sleeves that flap like the wings of ungainly birds: between them they carry a heavy cauldron of hot water. END
BEGIN NOW We were listening. END
BEGIN NOW We were listening. END
BEGIN NOW Did she struggle? END
BEGIN NOW She could not struggle long. END
BEGIN NOW They set down the cauldron at the foot of the bed. END
BEGIN NOW Saving your presence, Madam, we are come To make you sweeter than you'll be hereafter, And then be done with you. END
BEGIN NOW Three days together, my Lady, y'have had me ducked For easing a foolish maid at the wrong time; But now your breath is stopped and you are colder, And you shall be as wet as a drowned cat Ere I have done with you. END
BEGIN NOW Her pocket is empty; Hearken, and then begin: You have not touched a royal corpse before, But I have stretched a king and an old queen, A king's aunt and a king's brother too, Without much boasting of a still-born princess; So that I know, as a priest knows his prayers, All that is written in the chamberlain's book About the handling of exalted corpses, Stripping them and trussing them for the grave: And there it says that the chief corpse-washer Shall take for her own use by sacred right The coverlid, the upper sheet, the mattress Of any bed in which a queen has died, And the last robe of state the body wore; While humbler helpers may divide among them The under sheet, the pillow, and the bed-gown Stript from the cooling queen. END
BEGIN NOW Be thankful, then, and praise me every day That I have brought no other women with me To spoil you of your share. END
BEGIN NOW Ah, you have always been a friend to me: Many's the time I have said I did not know How I could even have lived but for your kindness. END
BEGIN NOW Pull her feet straight: is your mind wandering? END
BEGIN NOW She commences to fold the bedclothes, singing as she moves about. END
BEGIN NOW A louse crept out of my lady's shift— Ahumm, Ahumm, Ahee— Crying Oi! END
BEGIN NOW Oi! END
BEGIN NOW We are turned adrift; The lady's bosom is cold and stiffed, And her arm-pit's cold for me. END
BEGIN NOW While the Elder Woman sings, the Younger Woman straightens the Queen's feet and ties them together, draws the pillow from under her head, gathers her hair in one hand and knots it roughly; then she loosens her nightgown, revealing a jewel hung on a cord round the Queen's neck. END
BEGIN NOW What have you there? END
BEGIN NOW Give it to me. END
BEGIN NOW It is mine: I found it. END
BEGIN NOW Leave it. END
BEGIN NOW Will you not? END

BEGIN NOW Aie! END
BEGIN NOW Old thief! END
BEGIN NOW You are always thieving! END
BEGIN NOW You stole a necklace on your wedding-day: You could not bear a child, you stole your daughter: You stole a shroud the morn your husband died: Last week you stole the Princess Regan's comb.... She stumbles into the chair by the bed, and, throwing her loose sleeves over her head, rocks herself and moans. END
BEGIN NOW The lady's linen's no longer neat; — Ahumm, Ahumm, Ahee— Her savour is neither warm nor sweet; It's close for two in a winding-sheet, And lice are too good for worms to eat; So here's no place for me. END
BEGIN NOW Still work for old Hrogneda, little Princess? END
BEGIN NOW The way is easy: and it is to be used. END
BEGIN NOW How could this need have been conceived slowly? END
BEGIN NOW In a keen mind it should have leapt and burnt: What I have done would have been better done When my sad mother lived and could feel joy. END
BEGIN NOW This striking without thought is better than hunting; She showed more terror than an animal, She was more shiftless.... A little blood is lightly washed away, A common stain that need not be remembered; And a hot spasm of rightness quickly born Can guide me to kill justly and shall guide. END

BEGIN NOW Daughter, she is bleeding: she is slain. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, she is slain: I did it with a knife: And in this water is dissolved her blood, (Raising her arms and sprinkling the Queen's body) That now I scatter on the Queen of death For signal to her spirit that I can slake Her long corrosion of misery with such balm— Blood for weeping, terror for woe, death for death, A broken body for a broken heart. END
BEGIN NOW What will you say against me and my deed? END
BEGIN NOW That now you cannot save yourself from me. END
BEGIN NOW While your blind virgin power still stood apart In an unused, unviolated life, You judged me in my weakness, and because I felt you unflawed I could not answer you; But you have mingled in mortality And violently begun the common life By fault against your fellows; and the state, The state of Britain that inheres in me Not touched by my humanity or sin, Passions or privy acts, shall be as hard And savage to you as to a murderess. END
BEGIN NOW I found a warrant in her favoured bosom, King: She wore this on her heart when you were crowning her. END
BEGIN NOW Lear, opening the letter. END
BEGIN NOW But this is not my hand: (Looking about him on the floor) Where is the other letter? END
BEGIN NOW Is there another letter? END
BEGIN NOW What should it say? END
BEGIN NOW There is no other letter if you have none. END
BEGIN NOW (Reading) Open your window when the moon is dead, And I will come again. END
BEGIN NOW The men say everywhere that you are faithless.... And your eyes shifty eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Ah, but I love you, This is not hers: she'd not receive such words. END
BEGIN NOW Her name stands twice therein: her perfume fills it: My knife went through it ere I found it on her. END
BEGIN NOW The filth is suitably dead. END
BEGIN NOW You are my true daughter. END
BEGIN NOW I do not understand how men can govern, Use craft and exercise the duty of cunning, Anticipate treason, treachery meet with treachery, And yet believe a woman because she looks Straight in their eyes with mournful, trustful gaze, And lisps like innocence, all gentleness. END
BEGIN NOW Your I did not need to read her in a letter; I am not woman yet, but I can feel What untruths are instinctive in my kind, And how some men desire deceit from us. END
BEGIN NOW Come; let these washers do what they must do: Or shall your Queen be wrapped and coffined awry? END
BEGIN NOW She goes out by the garden doorway. END
BEGIN NOW I thought she had been broken long ago: She must be wedded and broken, I cannot do it. END
BEGIN NOW He follows The two women return to the bedside. END
BEGIN NOW Poor, masterful King, he is no easier, Although his tearful wife is gone at last: A wilful girl shall prick and thwart him now. END
BEGIN NOW Old gossip, we must hasten; the Queen is setting. END
BEGIN NOW Lend me a pair of pennies to weight her eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Find your own pennies: then you can steal them safely. END
BEGIN NOW Praise you the gods of Britain, as I do praise them, That I have been sweet-natured from my birth, And that I lack your unforgiving mind. END
BEGIN NOW Friend of the worms, help me to lift her clear And draw away the under sheet for you; Then go and spread the shroud by the hall fire— I never could put damp linen on a corpse. END
BEGIN NOW She sings. END
BEGIN NOW The louse made off unhappy and wet;— Ahumm, Ahumm, Ahee— He's looking for us, the little pet; So haste, for her chin's to tie up yet, And let us be gone with what we can get— Her ring for thee, her gown for Bet, Her pocket turned out for me.  END
BEGIN NOW  Scene: - Britain. END
BEGIN NOW ACT I. END
BEGIN NOW Scene I. END
BEGIN NOW Enter Kent, Gloucester, and Edmund. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW I thought the King had more affected the Duke of Albany than Cornwall. END
BEGIN NOW It did always seem so to us; but now, in the division of the kingdom, it appears not which of the Dukes he values most, for equalities are so weigh'd that curiosity in neither can make choice of either's moiety. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Is not this your son, my lord? END
BEGIN NOW His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge. END
BEGIN NOW I have so often blush'd to acknowledge him that now I am braz'd to't. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW I cannot conceive you. END
BEGIN NOW Sir, this young fellow's mother could; whereupon she grew round-womb'd, and had indeed, sir, a son for her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed. END
BEGIN NOW Do you smell a fault? END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it being so proper. END
BEGIN NOW But I have, sir, a son by order of law, some year elder than this, who yet is no dearer in my account. END
BEGIN NOW Though this knave came something saucily into the world before he was sent for, yet was his mother fair, there was good sport at his making, and the whoreson must be acknowledged.- Do you know this noble gentleman, Edmund? END
BEGIN NOW No, my lord. END
BEGIN NOW My Lord of Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Remember him hereafter as my honourable friend. END
BEGIN NOW My services to your lordship. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW I must love you, and sue to know you better. END
BEGIN NOW Sir, I shall study deserving. END
BEGIN NOW He hath been out nine years, and away he shall again. END
BEGIN NOW Sound a sennet. END
BEGIN NOW The King is coming. END
BEGIN NOW Enter one bearing a coronet; then Lear; then the Dukes of Albany and Cornwall; next, Goneril, Regan, Cordelia, with Followers. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Attend the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester. END
BEGIN NOW I shall, my liege. END
BEGIN NOW Exeunt Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Meantime we shall express our darker purpose. END
BEGIN NOW Give me the map there. END
BEGIN NOW Know we have divided In three our kingdom; and 'tis our fast intent To shake all cares and business from our age, Conferring them on younger strengths while we Unburthen'd crawl toward death. END
BEGIN NOW Our son of Cornwall, And you, our no less loving son of Albany, We have this hour a constant will to publish Our daughters' several dowers, that future strife May be prevented now. END
BEGIN NOW The princes, France and Burgundy, Great rivals in our youngest daughter's love, Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn, And here are to be answer'd. END
BEGIN NOW Tell me, my daughters (Since now we will divest us both of rule, Interest of territory, cares of state), Which of you shall we say doth love us most? END
BEGIN NOW That we our largest bounty may extend Where nature doth with merit challenge. END
BEGIN NOW Goneril, Our eldest-born, speak first. END
BEGIN NOW Sir, I love you more than words can wield the matter; Dearer than eyesight, space, and liberty; Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare; No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour; As much as child e'er lov'd, or father found; A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable. END
BEGIN NOW Beyond all manner of so much I love you. END
BEGIN NOW What shall Cordelia speak? END
BEGIN NOW Love, and be silent. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Of all these bounds, even from this line to this, With shadowy forests and with champains rich'd, With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads, We make thee lady. END
BEGIN NOW To thine and Albany's issue Be this perpetual.- What says our second daughter, Our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall? END
BEGIN NOW Speak. END
BEGIN NOW Sir, I am made Of the selfsame metal that my sister is, And prize me at her worth. END
BEGIN NOW In my true heart I find she names my very deed of love; Only she comes too short, that I profess Myself an enemy to all other joys Which the most precious square of sense possesses, And find I am alone felicitate In your dear Highness' love. END
BEGIN NOW Then poor Cordelia! END
BEGIN NOW And yet not so; since I am sure my love's More richer than my tongue. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW To thee and thine hereditary ever Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom, No less in space, validity, and pleasure Than that conferr'd on - Now, our joy, Although the last, not least; to whose young love The vines of France and milk of Burgundy Strive to be interest; what can you say to draw A third more opulent than your sisters? END
BEGIN NOW Speak. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing, my lord. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing? END
BEGIN NOW Nothing. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing can come of nothing. END
BEGIN NOW Speak again. END
BEGIN NOW Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave My heart into my mouth. END
BEGIN NOW I love your Majesty According to my bond; no more nor less. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW How, how, Cordelia? END
BEGIN NOW Mend your speech a little, Lest it may mar your fortunes. END
BEGIN NOW Good my lord, You have begot me, bred me, lov'd me; I Return those duties back as are right fit, Obey you, love you, and most honour you. END
BEGIN NOW Why have my sisters husbands, if they say They love you all? END
BEGIN NOW Haply, when I shall wed, That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry Half my love with him, half my care and duty. END
BEGIN NOW Sure I shall never marry like my sisters, To love my father all. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW But goes thy heart with this? END
BEGIN NOW Ay, good my lord. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW So young, and so untender? END
BEGIN NOW So young, my lord, and true. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Let it be so! END
BEGIN NOW thy truth then be thy dower! END
BEGIN NOW For, by the sacred radiance of the sun, The mysteries of Hecate and the night; By all the operation of the orbs From whom we do exist and cease to be; Here I disclaim all my paternal care, Propinquity and property of blood, And as a stranger to my heart and me Hold thee from this for ever. END
BEGIN NOW The barbarous Scythian, Or he that makes his generation messes To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom Be as well neighbour'd, pitied, and reliev'd, As thou my sometime daughter. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Good my liege- Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Peace, Kent! END
BEGIN NOW Come not between the dragon and his wrath. END
BEGIN NOW I lov'd her most, and thought to set my rest On her kind nursery.- Hence and avoid my sight!- So be my grave my peace as here I give Her father's heart from her! END
BEGIN NOW Call France! END
BEGIN NOW Who stirs? END
BEGIN NOW Call Burgundy! END
BEGIN NOW Cornwall and Albany, With my two daughters' dowers digest this third; Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her. END
BEGIN NOW I do invest you jointly in my power, Preeminence, and all the large effects That troop with majesty. END
BEGIN NOW Ourself, by monthly course, With reservation of an hundred knights, By you to be sustain'd, shall our abode Make with you by due turns. END

BEGIN NOW The bow is bent and drawn; make from the shaft. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Let it fall rather, though the fork invade The region of my heart! END
BEGIN NOW Be Kent unmannerly When Lear is mad. END
BEGIN NOW What wouldst thou do, old man? END
BEGIN NOW Think'st thou that duty shall have dread to speak When power to flattery bows? END
BEGIN NOW To plainness honour's bound When majesty falls to folly. END
BEGIN NOW Reverse thy doom; And in thy best consideration check This hideous rashness. END
BEGIN NOW Answer my life my judgment, Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least, Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound Reverbs no hollowness. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Kent, on thy life, no more! END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW My life I never held but as a pawn To wage against thine enemies; nor fear to lose it, Thy safety being the motive. END

BEGIN NOW Out of my sight! END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW See better, Lear, and let me still remain The true blank of thine eye. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END

BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW O vassal! END
BEGIN NOW miscreant! END
BEGIN NOW , Dear sir, forbear! END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Do! END
BEGIN NOW Kill thy physician, and the fee bestow Upon the foul disease. END
BEGIN NOW Revoke thy gift, Or, whilst I can vent clamour from my throat, I'll tell thee thou dost evil. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Hear me, recreant! END
BEGIN NOW On thine allegiance, hear me! END
BEGIN NOW Since thou hast sought to make us break our vow- Which we durst never yet- and with strain'd pride To come between our sentence and our power,- Which nor our nature nor our place can bear,- Our potency made good, take thy reward. END
BEGIN NOW Five days we do allot thee for provision To shield thee from diseases of the world, And on the sixth to turn thy hated back Upon our kingdom. END
BEGIN NOW If, on the tenth day following, Thy banish'd trunk be found in our dominions, The moment is thy death. END
BEGIN NOW Away! END
BEGIN NOW By Jupiter, This shall not be revok'd. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Fare thee well, King. END
BEGIN NOW Since thus thou wilt appear, Freedom lives hence, and banishment is here. END
BEGIN NOW The gods to their dear shelter take thee, maid, That justly think'st and hast most rightly said! END
BEGIN NOW And your large speeches may your deeds approve, That good effects may spring from words of love. END
BEGIN NOW Thus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu; He'll shape his old course in a country new. END
BEGIN NOW Exit. END
BEGIN NOW Flourish. END
BEGIN NOW Enter Gloucester, with France and Burgundy; Attendants. END
BEGIN NOW Here's France and Burgundy, my noble lord. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW My Lord of Burgundy, We first address toward you, who with this king Hath rivall'd for our daughter. END
BEGIN NOW What in the least Will you require in present dower with her, Or cease your quest of love? END
BEGIN NOW Most royal Majesty, I crave no more than hath your Highness offer'd, Nor will you tender less. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Right noble Burgundy, When she was dear to us, we did hold her so; But now her price is fall'n. END
BEGIN NOW Sir, there she stands. END
BEGIN NOW If aught within that little seeming substance, Or all of it, with our displeasure piec'd, And nothing more, may fitly like your Grace, She's there, and she is yours. END
BEGIN NOW I know no answer. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Will you, with those infirmities she owes, Unfriended, new adopted to our hate, Dow'r'd with our curse, and stranger'd with our oath, Take her, or leave her? END
BEGIN NOW Pardon me, royal sir. END
BEGIN NOW Election makes not up on such conditions. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Then leave her, sir; for, by the pow'r that made me, I tell you all her wealth. END
BEGIN NOW For you, great King, I would not from your love make such a stray To match you where I hate; therefore beseech you T' avert your liking a more worthier way Than on a wretch whom nature is asham'd Almost t' acknowledge hers. END
BEGIN NOW France. END
BEGIN NOW This is most strange, That she that even but now was your best object, The argument of your praise, balm of your age, Most best, most dearest, should in this trice of time Commit a thing so monstrous to dismantle So many folds of favour. END
BEGIN NOW Sure her offence Must be of such unnatural degree That monsters it, or your fore-vouch'd affection Fall'n into taint; which to believe of her Must be a faith that reason without miracle Should never plant in me. END
BEGIN NOW I yet beseech your Majesty, If for I want that glib and oily art To speak and purpose not, since what I well intend, I'll do't before I speak- that you make known It is no vicious blot, murther, or foulness, No unchaste action or dishonoured step, That hath depriv'd me of your grace and favour; But even for want of that for which I am richer- A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue As I am glad I have not, though not to have it Hath lost me in your liking. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Better thou Hadst not been born than not t' have pleas'd me better. END
BEGIN NOW France. END
BEGIN NOW Is it but this- a tardiness in nature Which often leaves the history unspoke That it intends to do? END
BEGIN NOW My Lord of Burgundy, What say you to the lady? END
BEGIN NOW Love's not love When it is mingled with regards that stands Aloof from th' entire point. END
BEGIN NOW Will you have her? END
BEGIN NOW She is herself a dowry. END
BEGIN NOW Royal Lear, Give but that portion which yourself propos'd, And here I take Cordelia by the hand, Duchess of Burgundy. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing! END
BEGIN NOW I have sworn; I am firm. END
BEGIN NOW I am sorry then you have so lost a father That you must lose a husband. END
BEGIN NOW Peace be with Burgundy! END
BEGIN NOW Since that respects of fortune are his love, I shall not be his wife. END
BEGIN NOW France. END
BEGIN NOW Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich, being poor; Most choice, forsaken; and most lov'd, despis'd! END
BEGIN NOW Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon. END
BEGIN NOW Be it lawful I take up what's cast away. END
BEGIN NOW Gods, gods! END
BEGIN NOW 'tis strange that from their cold'st neglect My love should kindle to inflam'd respect. END
BEGIN NOW Thy dow'rless daughter, King, thrown to my chance, Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France. END
BEGIN NOW Not all the dukes in wat'rish Burgundy Can buy this unpriz'd precious maid of me. END
BEGIN NOW Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind. END
BEGIN NOW Thou losest here, a better where to find. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Thou hast her, France; let her be thine; for we Have no such daughter, nor shall ever see That face of hers again. END
BEGIN NOW Therefore be gone Without our grace, our love, our benison. END
BEGIN NOW Come, noble Burgundy. END
BEGIN NOW Flourish. END
BEGIN NOW Exeunt Lear, Burgundy, France. END
BEGIN NOW Bid farewell to your sisters. END
BEGIN NOW The jewels of our father, with wash'd eyes Cordelia leaves you. END
BEGIN NOW I know you what you are; And, like a sister, am most loath to call Your faults as they are nam'd. END
BEGIN NOW Use well our father. END
BEGIN NOW To your professed bosoms I commit him; But yet, alas, stood I within his grace, I would prefer him to a better place! END
BEGIN NOW So farewell to you both. END
BEGIN NOW Prescribe not us our duties. END
BEGIN NOW Let your study Be to content your lord, who hath receiv'd you At fortune's alms. END
BEGIN NOW You have obedience scanted, And well are worth the want that you have wanted. END
BEGIN NOW Time shall unfold what plighted cunning hides. END
BEGIN NOW Who cover faults, at last shame them derides. END
BEGIN NOW Well may you prosper! END
BEGIN NOW France. END
BEGIN NOW Come, my fair Cordelia. END
BEGIN NOW Exeunt France and Cordelia. END
BEGIN NOW Sister, it is not little I have to say of what most nearly appertains to us both. END
BEGIN NOW I think our father will hence to-night. END
BEGIN NOW That's most certain, and with you; next month with us. END
BEGIN NOW You see how full of changes his age is. END
BEGIN NOW The observation we have made of it hath not been little. END
BEGIN NOW He always lov'd our sister most, and with what poor judgment he hath now cast her off appears too grossly. END
BEGIN NOW 'Tis the infirmity of his age; yet he hath ever but slenderly known himself. END
BEGIN NOW The best and soundest of his time hath been but rash; then must we look to receive from his age, not alone the imperfections of long-ingraffed condition, but therewithal the unruly waywardness that infirm and choleric years bring with them. END
BEGIN NOW Such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as this of Kent's banishment. END
BEGIN NOW There is further compliment of leave-taking between France and him. END
BEGIN NOW Pray you let's hit together. END
BEGIN NOW If our father carry authority with such dispositions as he bears, this last surrender of his will but offend us. END
BEGIN NOW We shall further think on't. END
BEGIN NOW We must do something, and i' th' heat. END
BEGIN NOW Scene II. END
BEGIN NOW The Earl of Gloucester's Castle. END
BEGIN NOW Enter Thou, Nature, art my goddess; to thy law My services are bound. END
BEGIN NOW Wherefore should I Stand in the plague of custom, and permit The curiosity of nations to deprive me, For that I am some twelve or fourteen moonshines Lag of a brother? END
BEGIN NOW Why bastard? END
BEGIN NOW wherefore base? END
BEGIN NOW When my dimensions are as well compact, My mind as generous, and my shape as true, As honest madam's issue? END
BEGIN NOW Why brand they us With base? END
BEGIN NOW with baseness? END
BEGIN NOW bastardy? END
BEGIN NOW base, base? END
BEGIN NOW Who, in the lusty stealth of nature, take More composition and fierce quality Than doth, within a dull, stale, tired bed, Go to th' creating a whole tribe of fops Got 'tween asleep and wake? END
BEGIN NOW Well then, Legitimate Edgar, I must have your land. END
BEGIN NOW Our father's love is to the bastard Edmund As to th' legitimate. END
BEGIN NOW Fine word- 'legitimate'! END
BEGIN NOW Well, my legitimate, if this letter speed, And my invention thrive, Edmund the base Shall top th' legitimate. END
BEGIN NOW I grow; I prosper. END
BEGIN NOW Now, gods, stand up for bastards! END
BEGIN NOW Enter Gloucester. END
BEGIN NOW Kent banish'd thus? END
BEGIN NOW and France in choler parted? END
BEGIN NOW And the King gone to-night? END
BEGIN NOW subscrib'd his pow'r? END
BEGIN NOW Confin'd to exhibition? END
BEGIN NOW All this done Upon the gad? END
BEGIN NOW Edmund, how now? END
BEGIN NOW What news? END
BEGIN NOW So please your lordship, none. END
BEGIN NOW Why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter? END
BEGIN NOW I know no news, my lord. END
BEGIN NOW What paper were you reading? END
BEGIN NOW Nothing, my lord. END
BEGIN NOW No? END
BEGIN NOW What needed then that terrible dispatch of it into your pocket? END
BEGIN NOW The quality of nothing hath not such need to hide itself. END
BEGIN NOW Let's see. END
BEGIN NOW Come, if it be nothing, I shall not need spectacles. END
BEGIN NOW I beseech you, sir, pardon me. END
BEGIN NOW It is a letter from my brother that I have not all o'er-read; and for so much as I have perus'd, I find it not fit for your o'erlooking. END
BEGIN NOW Give me the letter, sir. END
BEGIN NOW I shall offend, either to detain or give it. END
BEGIN NOW The contents, as in part I understand them, are to blame. END
BEGIN NOW Let's see, let's see! END
BEGIN NOW I hope, for my brother's justification, he wrote this but as an essay or taste of my virtue. END
BEGIN NOW (reads) 'This policy and reverence of age makes the world bitter to the best of our times; keeps our fortunes from us till our oldness cannot relish them. END
BEGIN NOW I begin to find an idle and fond bondage in the oppression of aged tyranny, who sways, not as it hath power, but as it is suffer'd. END
BEGIN NOW Come to me, that of this I may speak more. END
BEGIN NOW If our father would sleep till I wak'd him, you should enjoy half his revenue for ever, and live the beloved of your brother, 'EDGAR.' END
BEGIN NOW Hum! END
BEGIN NOW Conspiracy? END
BEGIN NOW 'Sleep till I wak'd him, you should enjoy half his revenue.' END
BEGIN NOW My son Edgar! END
BEGIN NOW Had he a hand to write this? END
BEGIN NOW a heart and brain to breed it in? END
BEGIN NOW When came this to you? END
BEGIN NOW Who brought it? END
BEGIN NOW It was not brought me, my lord: there's the cunning of it. END
BEGIN NOW I found it thrown in at the casement of my closet. END
BEGIN NOW You know the character to be your brother's? END
BEGIN NOW If the matter were good, my lord, I durst swear it were his; but in respect of that, I would fain think it were not. END
BEGIN NOW It is his. END
BEGIN NOW It is his hand, my lord; but I hope his heart is not in the contents. END
BEGIN NOW Hath he never before sounded you in this business? END
BEGIN NOW Never, my lord. END
BEGIN NOW But I have heard him oft maintain it to be fit that, sons at perfect age, and fathers declining, the father should be as ward to the son, and the son manage his revenue. END
BEGIN NOW O villain, villain! END
BEGIN NOW His very opinion in the letter! END
BEGIN NOW Abhorred villain! END
BEGIN NOW Unnatural, detested, brutish villain! END
BEGIN NOW worse than brutish! END
BEGIN NOW Go, sirrah, seek him. END
BEGIN NOW I'll apprehend him. END
BEGIN NOW Abominable villain! END
BEGIN NOW Where is he? END
BEGIN NOW I do not well know, my lord. END
BEGIN NOW If it shall please you to suspend your indignation against my brother till you can derive from him better testimony of his intent, you should run a certain course; where, if you violently proceed against him, mistaking his purpose, it would make a great gap in your own honour and shake in pieces the heart of his obedience. END
BEGIN NOW I dare pawn down my life for him that he hath writ this to feel my affection to your honour, and to no other pretence of danger. END
BEGIN NOW Think you so? END
BEGIN NOW If your honour judge it meet, I will place you where you shall hear us confer of this and by an auricular assurance have your satisfaction, and that without any further delay than this very evening. END
BEGIN NOW He cannot be such a monster. END
BEGIN NOW Nor is not, sure. END
BEGIN NOW To his father, that so tenderly and entirely loves him. END
BEGIN NOW Heaven and earth! END
BEGIN NOW Edmund, seek him out; wind me into him, I pray you; frame the business after your own wisdom. END
BEGIN NOW I would unstate myself to be in a due resolution. END
BEGIN NOW I will seek him, sir, presently; convey the business as I shall find means, and acquaint you withal. END
BEGIN NOW These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us. END
BEGIN NOW Though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus, yet nature finds itself scourg'd by the sequent effects. END
BEGIN NOW Love cools, friendship falls off, brothers divide. END
BEGIN NOW In cities, mutinies; in countries, discord; in palaces, treason; and the bond crack'd 'twixt son and father. END
BEGIN NOW This villain of mine comes under the prediction; there's son against father: the King falls from bias of nature; there's father against child. END
BEGIN NOW We have seen the best of our time. END
BEGIN NOW Machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves. END
BEGIN NOW Find out this villain, Edmund; it shall lose thee nothing; do it carefully. END
BEGIN NOW And the noble and true-hearted Kent banish'd! END
BEGIN NOW his offence, honesty! END
BEGIN NOW 'Tis strange. END
BEGIN NOW Exit. END
BEGIN NOW This is the excellent foppery of the world, that, when we are sick in fortune, often the surfeit of our own behaviour, we make guilty of our disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars; as if we were villains on necessity; fools by heavenly compulsion; knaves, thieves, and treachers by spherical pre-dominance; drunkards, liars, and adulterers by an enforc'd obedience of planetary influence; and all that we are evil in, by a divine thrusting on. END
BEGIN NOW An admirable evasion of whore-master man, to lay his goatish disposition to the charge of a star! END
BEGIN NOW My father compounded with my mother under the Dragon's Tail, and my nativity was under Ursa Major, so that it follows I am rough and lecherous. END
BEGIN NOW Fut! END
BEGIN NOW I should have been that I am, had the maidenliest star in the firmament twinkled on my bastardizing. END

BEGIN NOW and pat! END
BEGIN NOW he comes, like the catastrophe of the old comedy. END
BEGIN NOW My cue is villainous melancholy, with a sigh like Tom o' Bedlam. END
BEGIN NOW O, these eclipses do portend these divisions! END
BEGIN NOW Fa, sol, la, mi. END
BEGIN NOW How now, brother Edmund? END
BEGIN NOW What serious contemplation are you in? END
BEGIN NOW I am thinking, brother, of a prediction I read this other day, what should follow these eclipses. END
BEGIN NOW Do you busy yourself with that? END
BEGIN NOW I promise you, the effects he writes of succeed unhappily: as of unnaturalness between the child and the parent; death, dearth, dissolutions of ancient amities; divisions in state, menaces and maledictions against king and nobles; needless diffidences, banishment of friends, dissipation of cohorts, nuptial breaches, and I know not what. END
BEGIN NOW How long have you been a sectary astronomical? END
BEGIN NOW Come, come! END
BEGIN NOW When saw you my father last? END
BEGIN NOW The night gone by. END
BEGIN NOW Spake you with him? END
BEGIN NOW Ay, two hours together. END
BEGIN NOW Parted you in good terms? END
BEGIN NOW Found you no displeasure in him by word or countenance None at all. END
BEGIN NOW Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended him; and at my entreaty forbear his presence until some little time hath qualified the heat of his displeasure, which at this instant so rageth in him that with the mischief of your person it would scarcely allay. END
BEGIN NOW Some villain hath done me wrong. END
BEGIN NOW That's my fear. END
BEGIN NOW I pray you have a continent forbearance till the speed of his rage goes slower; and, as I say, retire with me to my lodging, from whence I will fitly bring you to hear my lord speak. END
BEGIN NOW Pray ye, go! END
BEGIN NOW There's my key. END
BEGIN NOW If you do stir abroad, go arm'd. END
BEGIN NOW Arm'd, brother? END
BEGIN NOW Brother, I advise you to the best. END
BEGIN NOW Go arm'd. END
BEGIN NOW I am no honest man if there be any good meaning toward you. END
BEGIN NOW I have told you what I have seen and heard; but faintly, nothing like the image and horror of it. END
BEGIN NOW Pray you, away! END
BEGIN NOW Shall I hear from you anon? END
BEGIN NOW I do serve you in this business. END
BEGIN NOW Exit Edgar. END
BEGIN NOW A credulous father! END
BEGIN NOW and a brother noble, Whose nature is so far from doing harms That he suspects none; on whose foolish honesty My practices ride easy! END
BEGIN NOW I see the business. END
BEGIN NOW Let me, if not by birth, have lands by wit; All with me's meet that I can fashion fit. END

BEGIN NOW The Duke of Albany's Palace. END
BEGIN NOW Enter Did my father strike my gentleman for chiding of his fool? END
BEGIN NOW Ay, madam. END
BEGIN NOW By day and night, he wrongs me! END
BEGIN NOW Every hour He flashes into one gross crime or other That sets us all at odds. END
BEGIN NOW I'll not endure it. END
BEGIN NOW His knights grow riotous, and himself upbraids us On every trifle. END
BEGIN NOW When he returns from hunting, I will not speak with him. END
BEGIN NOW Say I am sick. END
BEGIN NOW If you come slack of former services, You shall do well; the fault of it I'll answer. END
BEGIN NOW He's coming, madam; I hear him. END
BEGIN NOW Put on what weary negligence you please, You and your fellows. END
BEGIN NOW I'd have it come to question. END
BEGIN NOW If he distaste it, let him to our sister, Whose mind and mine I know in that are one, Not to be overrul'd. END
BEGIN NOW Idle old man, That still would manage those authorities That he hath given away! END
BEGIN NOW Now, by my life, Old fools are babes again, and must be us'd With checks as flatteries, when they are seen abus'd. END
BEGIN NOW Remember what I have said. END
BEGIN NOW Very well, madam. END
BEGIN NOW And let his knights have colder looks among you. END
BEGIN NOW What grows of it, no matter. END
BEGIN NOW Advise your fellows so. END
BEGIN NOW I would breed from hence occasions, and I shall, That I may speak. END
BEGIN NOW I'll write straight to my sister To hold my very course. END
BEGIN NOW Prepare for dinner. END
BEGIN NOW Scene IV. END
BEGIN NOW The Duke of Albany's Palace. END
BEGIN NOW Enter Kent, Kent. END
BEGIN NOW If but as well I other accents borrow, That can my speech defuse, my good intent May carry through itself to that full issue For which I raz'd my likeness. END
BEGIN NOW Now, banish'd Kent, If thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemn'd, So may it come, thy master, whom thou lov'st, Shall find thee full of labours. END
BEGIN NOW Horns within. END
BEGIN NOW Enter Lear, and Attendants. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Let me not stay a jot for dinner; go get it ready. END
BEGIN NOW How now? END
BEGIN NOW What art thou? END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW A man, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW What dost thou profess? END
BEGIN NOW What wouldst thou with us? END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW I do profess to be no less than I seem, to serve him truly that will put me in trust, to love him that is honest, to converse with him that is wise and says little, to fear judgment, to fight when I cannot choose, and to eat no fish. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW What art thou? END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW A very honest-hearted fellow, and as poor as the King. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW If thou be'st as poor for a subject as he's for a king, thou art poor enough. END
BEGIN NOW What wouldst thou? END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Service. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Who wouldst thou serve? END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW You. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Dost thou know me, fellow? END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW No, sir; but you have that in your countenance which I would fain call master. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW What's that? END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Authority. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW What services canst thou do? END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW I can keep honest counsel, ride, run, mar a curious tale in telling it and deliver a plain message bluntly. END
BEGIN NOW That which ordinary men are fit for, I am qualified in, and the best of me is diligence. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW How old art thou? END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Not so young, sir, to love a woman for singing, nor so old to dote on her for anything. END
BEGIN NOW I have years on my back forty-eight. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Follow me; thou shalt serve me. END
BEGIN NOW If I like thee no worse after dinner, I will not part from thee yet. END
BEGIN NOW Dinner, ho, dinner! END
BEGIN NOW Where's my knave? END
BEGIN NOW my fool? END
BEGIN NOW Go you and call my fool hither. END
BEGIN NOW Enter Steward. END
BEGIN NOW You, you, sirrah, where's my daughter? END
BEGIN NOW So please you- Exit. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW What says the fellow there? END
BEGIN NOW Call the clotpoll back. END
BEGIN NOW Where's my fool, ho? END
BEGIN NOW I think the world's asleep. END
BEGIN NOW How now? END
BEGIN NOW Where's that mongrel? END
BEGIN NOW He says, my lord, your daughter is not well. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Why came not the slave back to me when I call'd him? END
BEGIN NOW Sir, he answered me in the roundest manner, he would not. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW He would not? END
BEGIN NOW My lord, I know not what the matter is; but to my judgment your Highness is not entertain'd with that ceremonious affection as you were wont. END
BEGIN NOW There's a great abatement of kindness appears as well in the general dependants as in the Duke himself also and your daughter. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Ha! END
BEGIN NOW say'st thou so? END
BEGIN NOW I beseech you pardon me, my lord, if I be mistaken; for my duty cannot be silent when I think your Highness wrong'd. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Thou but rememb'rest me of mine own conception. END
BEGIN NOW I have perceived a most faint neglect of late, which I have rather blamed as mine own jealous curiosity than as a very pretence and purpose of unkindness. END
BEGIN NOW I will look further into't. END
BEGIN NOW But where's my fool? END
BEGIN NOW I have not seen him this two days. END
BEGIN NOW Since my young lady's going into France, sir, the fool hath much pined away. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW No more of that; I have noted it well. END
BEGIN NOW Go you and tell my daughter I would speak with her. END
BEGIN NOW Go you, call hither my fool. END
BEGIN NOW Enter Steward. END
BEGIN NOW O, you, sir, you! END
BEGIN NOW Come you hither, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Who am I, sir? END
BEGIN NOW My lady's father. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW 'My lady's father'? END
BEGIN NOW My lord's knave! END
BEGIN NOW You whoreson dog! END
BEGIN NOW you slave! END
BEGIN NOW you cur! END
BEGIN NOW I am none of these, my lord; I beseech your pardon. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Do you bandy looks with me, you rascal? END
BEGIN NOW I'll not be strucken, my lord. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Nor tripp'd neither, you base football player? END
BEGIN NOW [Trips up his heels. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW I thank thee, fellow. END
BEGIN NOW Thou serv'st me, and I'll love thee. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Come, sir, arise, away! END
BEGIN NOW I'll teach you differences. END
BEGIN NOW Away, away! END
BEGIN NOW If you will measure your lubber's length again, tarry; but away! END
BEGIN NOW Go to! END
BEGIN NOW Have you wisdom? END
BEGIN NOW So. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Now, my friendly knave, I thank thee. END
BEGIN NOW There's earnest of thy service. END
BEGIN NOW Enter Fool. END
BEGIN NOW Fool. END
BEGIN NOW Let me hire him too. END
BEGIN NOW Here's my coxcomb. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW How now, my pretty knave? END
BEGIN NOW How dost thou? END
BEGIN NOW Fool. END
BEGIN NOW Sirrah, you were best take my coxcomb. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Why, fool? END
BEGIN NOW Fool. END
BEGIN NOW Why? END
BEGIN NOW For taking one's part that's out of favour. END
BEGIN NOW Nay, an thou canst not smile as the wind sits, thou'lt catch cold shortly. END
BEGIN NOW There, take my coxcomb! END
BEGIN NOW Why, this fellow hath banish'd two on's daughters, and did the third a blessing against his will. END
BEGIN NOW If thou follow him, thou must needs wear my coxcomb.- How now, nuncle? END
BEGIN NOW Would I had two coxcombs and two daughters! END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Why, my boy? END
BEGIN NOW Fool. END
BEGIN NOW If I gave them all my living, I'ld keep my coxcombs myself. END
BEGIN NOW There's mine! END
BEGIN NOW beg another of thy daughters. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Take heed, sirrah- the whip. END
BEGIN NOW Fool. END
BEGIN NOW Truth's a dog must to kennel; he must be whipp'd out, when Lady the brach may stand by th' fire and stink. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW A pestilent gall to me! END
BEGIN NOW Fool. END
BEGIN NOW Sirrah, I'll teach thee a speech. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Do. END
BEGIN NOW Fool. END
BEGIN NOW Mark it, nuncle. END
BEGIN NOW Have more than thou showest, Speak less than thou knowest, Lend less than thou owest, Ride more than thou goest, Learn more than thou trowest, Set less than thou throwest; Leave thy drink and thy whore, And keep in-a-door, And thou shalt have more Than two tens to a score. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW This is nothing, fool. END
BEGIN NOW Fool. END
BEGIN NOW Then 'tis like the breath of an unfeed lawyer- you gave me nothing for't. END
BEGIN NOW Can you make no use of nothing, nuncle? END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Why, no, boy. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing can be made out of nothing. END
BEGIN NOW Fool. END
BEGIN NOW Prithee tell him, so much the rent of his land comes to. END
BEGIN NOW He will not believe a fool. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW A bitter fool! END
BEGIN NOW Fool. END
BEGIN NOW Dost thou know the difference, my boy, between a bitter fool and a sweet fool? END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW No, lad; teach me. END
BEGIN NOW Fool. END
BEGIN NOW That lord that counsell'd thee To give away thy land, Come place him here by me- Do thou for him stand. END
BEGIN NOW The sweet and bitter fool Will presently appear; The one in motley here, The other found out there. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Dost thou call me fool, boy? END
BEGIN NOW Fool. END
BEGIN NOW All thy other titles thou hast given away; that thou wast born with. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW This is not altogether fool, my lord. END
BEGIN NOW Fool. END
BEGIN NOW No, faith; lords and great men will not let me. END
BEGIN NOW If I had a monopoly out, they would have part on't. END
BEGIN NOW And ladies too, they will not let me have all the fool to myself; they'll be snatching. END
BEGIN NOW Give me an egg, nuncle, and I'll give thee two crowns. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW What two crowns shall they be? END
BEGIN NOW Fool. END
BEGIN NOW Why, after I have cut the egg i' th' middle and eat up the meat, the two crowns of the egg. END
BEGIN NOW When thou clovest thy crown i' th' middle and gav'st away both parts, thou bor'st thine ass on thy back o'er the dirt. END
BEGIN NOW Thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown when thou gav'st thy golden one away. END
BEGIN NOW If I speak like myself in this, let him be whipp'd that first finds it so. END
BEGIN NOW Fools had ne'er less grace in a year, For wise men are grown foppish; They know not how their wits to wear, Their manners are so apish. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW When were you wont to be so full of songs, sirrah? END
BEGIN NOW Fool. END
BEGIN NOW I have us'd it, nuncle, ever since thou mad'st thy daughters thy mother; for when thou gav'st them the rod, and put'st down thine own breeches, Then they for sudden joy did weep, And I for sorrow sung, That such a king should play bo-peep And go the fools among. END
BEGIN NOW Prithee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster that can teach thy fool to lie. END
BEGIN NOW I would fain learn to lie. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW An you lie, sirrah, we'll have you whipp'd. END
BEGIN NOW Fool. END
BEGIN NOW I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are. END
BEGIN NOW They'll have me whipp'd for speaking true; thou'lt have me whipp'd for lying; and sometimes I am whipp'd for holding my peace. END
BEGIN NOW I had rather be any kind o' thing than a fool! END
BEGIN NOW And yet I would not be thee, nuncle. END
BEGIN NOW Thou hast pared thy wit o' both sides and left nothing i' th' middle. END
BEGIN NOW Here comes one o' the parings. END
BEGIN NOW Enter Lear. END
BEGIN NOW How now, daughter? END
BEGIN NOW What makes that frontlet on? END
BEGIN NOW Methinks you are too much o' late i' th' frown. END
BEGIN NOW Fool. END
BEGIN NOW Thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no need to care for her frowning. END
BEGIN NOW Now thou art an O without a figure. END
BEGIN NOW I am better than thou art now: I am a fool, thou art nothing. END
BEGIN NOW [To So your face bids me, though you say nothing. END
BEGIN NOW Mum, mum! END
BEGIN NOW He that keeps nor crust nor crum, Weary of all, shall want some.- That's a sheal'd peascod. END
BEGIN NOW Not only, sir, this your all-licens'd fool, But other of your insolent retinue Do hourly carp and quarrel, breaking forth In rank and not-to-be-endured riots. END
BEGIN NOW Sir, I had thought, by making this well known unto you, To have found a safe redress, but now grow fearful, By what yourself, too, late have spoke and done, That you protect this course, and put it on By your allowance; which if you should, the fault Would not scape censure, nor the redresses sleep, Which, in the tender of a wholesome weal, Might in their working do you that offence Which else were shame, that then necessity Must call discreet proceeding. END
BEGIN NOW Fool. END
BEGIN NOW For you know, nuncle, The hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long That it had it head bit off by it young. END
BEGIN NOW So out went the candle, and we were left darkling. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Are you our daughter? END
BEGIN NOW Come, sir, I would you would make use of that good wisdom Whereof I know you are fraught, and put away These dispositions that of late transform you From what you rightly are. END
BEGIN NOW Fool. END
BEGIN NOW May not an ass know when the cart draws the horse? END
BEGIN NOW Whoop, Jug, I love thee! END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Doth any here know me? END
BEGIN NOW This is not Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Doth Lear walk thus? END
BEGIN NOW speak thus? END
BEGIN NOW Where are his eyes? END
BEGIN NOW Either his notion weakens, his discernings Are lethargied- Ha! END
BEGIN NOW waking? END
BEGIN NOW 'Tis not so! END
BEGIN NOW Who is it that can tell me who I am? END
BEGIN NOW Fool. END
BEGIN NOW Lear's shadow. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW I would learn that; for, by the marks of sovereignty, Knowledge, and reason, I should be false persuaded I had daughters. END
BEGIN NOW Fool. END
BEGIN NOW Which they will make an obedient father. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Your name, fair gentlewoman? END
BEGIN NOW This admiration, sir, is much o' th' savour Of other your new pranks. END
BEGIN NOW I do beseech you To understand my purposes aright. END
BEGIN NOW As you are old and reverend, you should be wise. END
BEGIN NOW Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires; Men so disorder'd, so debosh'd, and bold That this our court, infected with their manners, Shows like a riotous inn. END
BEGIN NOW Epicurism and lust Make it more like a tavern or a brothel Than a grac'd palace. END
BEGIN NOW The shame itself doth speak For instant remedy. END
BEGIN NOW Be then desir'd By her that else will take the thing she begs A little to disquantity your train, And the remainder that shall still depend To be such men as may besort your age, Which know themselves, and you. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Darkness and devils! END
BEGIN NOW Saddle my horses! END
BEGIN NOW Call my train together! END
BEGIN NOW Degenerate bastard, I'll not trouble thee; Yet have I left a daughter. END
BEGIN NOW You strike my people, and your disorder'd rabble Make servants of their betters. END
BEGIN NOW Enter Albany. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Woe that too late repents!- O, sir, are you come? END
BEGIN NOW Is it your will? END
BEGIN NOW Speak, sir!- Prepare my horses. END
BEGIN NOW Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend, More hideous when thou show'st thee in a child Than the sea-monster! END
BEGIN NOW Pray, sir, be patient. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Detested kite, thou liest! END
BEGIN NOW My train are men of choice and rarest parts, That all particulars of duty know And in the most exact regard support The worships of their name.- O most small fault, How ugly didst thou in Cordelia show! END
BEGIN NOW Which, like an engine, wrench'd my frame of nature From the fix'd place; drew from my heart all love And added to the gall. END
BEGIN NOW O Lear, Lear, Lear! END
BEGIN NOW Beat at this gate that let thy folly in And thy dear judgment out! END
BEGIN NOW Go, go, my people. END
BEGIN NOW My lord, I am guiltless, as I am ignorant Of what hath mov'd you. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW It may be so, my lord. END
BEGIN NOW Hear, Nature, hear! END
BEGIN NOW dear goddess, hear! END
BEGIN NOW Suspend thy purpose, if thou didst intend To make this creature fruitful. END
BEGIN NOW Into her womb convey sterility; Dry up in her the organs of increase; And from her derogate body never spring A babe to honour her! END
BEGIN NOW If she must teem, Create her child of spleen, that it may live And be a thwart disnatur'd torment to her. END
BEGIN NOW Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth, With cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks, Turn all her mother's pains and benefits To laughter and contempt, that she may feel How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is To have a thankless child! END
BEGIN NOW Away, away! END
BEGIN NOW Exit. END
BEGIN NOW Now, gods that we adore, whereof comes this? END
BEGIN NOW Never afflict yourself to know the cause; But let his disposition have that scope That dotage gives it. END
BEGIN NOW Enter Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW What, fifty of my followers at a clap? END
BEGIN NOW Within a fortnight? END
BEGIN NOW What's the matter, sir? END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW I'll tell thee. END
BEGIN NOW Life and death! END
BEGIN NOW I am asham'd That thou hast power to shake my manhood thus; That these hot tears, which break from me perforce, Should make thee worth them. END
BEGIN NOW Blasts and fogs upon thee! END
BEGIN NOW Th' untented woundings of a father's curse Pierce every sense about thee!- Old fond eyes, Beweep this cause again, I'll pluck ye out, And cast you, with the waters that you lose, To temper clay. END
BEGIN NOW Yea, is it come to this? END
BEGIN NOW Let it be so. END
BEGIN NOW Yet have I left a daughter, Who I am sure is kind and comfortable. END
BEGIN NOW When she shall hear this of thee, with her nails She'll flay thy wolvish visage. END
BEGIN NOW Thou shalt find That I'll resume the shape which thou dost think I have cast off for ever; thou shalt, I warrant thee. END
BEGIN NOW Exeunt Do you mark that, my lord? END
BEGIN NOW I cannot be so partial, Goneril, To the great love I bear you - Pray you, content.- What, Oswald, ho! END
BEGIN NOW You, sir, more knave than fool, after your master! END
BEGIN NOW Fool. END
BEGIN NOW Nuncle Lear, nuncle Lear, tarry! END
BEGIN NOW Take the fool with thee. END
BEGIN NOW A fox when one has caught her, And such a daughter, Should sure to the slaughter, If my cap would buy a halter. END
BEGIN NOW So the fool follows after. END
BEGIN NOW Exit. END
BEGIN NOW This man hath had good counsel! END
BEGIN NOW A hundred knights? END
BEGIN NOW 'Tis politic and safe to let him keep At point a hundred knights; yes, that on every dream, Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike, He may enguard his dotage with their pow'rs And hold our lives in mercy.- Oswald, I say! END
BEGIN NOW Well, you may fear too far. END
BEGIN NOW Safer than trust too far. END
BEGIN NOW Let me still take away the harms I fear, Not fear still to be taken. END
BEGIN NOW I know his heart. END
BEGIN NOW What he hath utter'd I have writ my sister. END
BEGIN NOW If she sustain him and his hundred knights, When I have show'd th' unfitness- Enter Steward. END
BEGIN NOW How now, Oswald? END
BEGIN NOW What, have you writ that letter to my sister? END
BEGIN NOW Yes, madam. END
BEGIN NOW Take you some company, and away to horse! END
BEGIN NOW Inform her full of my particular fear, And thereto add such reasons of your own As may compact it more. END
BEGIN NOW Get you gone, And hasten your return. END
BEGIN NOW No, no, my lord! END
BEGIN NOW This milky gentleness and course of yours, Though I condemn it not, yet, under pardon, You are much more at task for want of wisdom Than prais'd for harmful mildness. END
BEGIN NOW How far your eyes may pierce I cannot tell. END
BEGIN NOW Striving to better, oft we mar what's well. END
BEGIN NOW Nay then- Well, well; th' event. END
BEGIN NOW Scene V. Court before the Duke of Albany's Palace. END

BEGIN NOW Thy wit shall ne'er go slip-shod. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Ha, ha, ha! END
BEGIN NOW Fool. END
BEGIN NOW Shalt see thy other daughter will use thee kindly; for though she's as like this as a crab's like an apple, yet I can tell what I can tell. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW What canst tell, boy? END
BEGIN NOW Fool. END
BEGIN NOW She'll taste as like this as a crab does to a crab. END
BEGIN NOW Thou canst tell why one's nose stands i' th' middle on's face? END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW Fool. END
BEGIN NOW Why, to keep one's eyes of either side's nose, that what a man cannot smell out, 'a may spy into. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW I did her wrong. END
BEGIN NOW Fool. END
BEGIN NOW Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell? END

BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW Fool. END
BEGIN NOW Nor I neither; but I can tell why a snail has a house. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Why? END
BEGIN NOW Fool. END
BEGIN NOW Why, to put's head in; not to give it away to his daughters, and leave his horns without a case. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW I will forget my nature. END
BEGIN NOW So kind a father!- Be my horses ready? END
BEGIN NOW Fool. END
BEGIN NOW Thy asses are gone about 'em. END
BEGIN NOW The reason why the seven stars are no moe than seven is a pretty reason. END

BEGIN NOW I have been with your father, and given him notice that the Duke of Cornwall and Regan his Duchess will be here with him this night. END
BEGIN NOW How comes that? END
BEGIN NOW Nay, I know not. END
BEGIN NOW You have heard of the news abroad- I mean the whisper'd ones, for they are yet but ear-kissing arguments? END
BEGIN NOW Not I. Pray you, what are they? END
BEGIN NOW Have you heard of no likely wars toward 'twixt the two Dukes of Cornwall and Albany? END
BEGIN NOW Not a word. END
BEGIN NOW You may do, then, in time. END
BEGIN NOW Fare you well, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Exit. END
BEGIN NOW The Duke be here to-night? END
BEGIN NOW The better! END
BEGIN NOW best! END
BEGIN NOW This weaves itself perforce into my business. END
BEGIN NOW My father hath set guard to take my brother; And I have one thing, of a queasy question, Which I must act. END
BEGIN NOW Briefness and fortune, work! END
BEGIN NOW Brother, a word! END
BEGIN NOW Descend! END
BEGIN NOW Brother, I say! END
BEGIN NOW Enter Edgar. END
BEGIN NOW My father watches. END
BEGIN NOW O sir, fly this place! END
BEGIN NOW Intelligence is given where you are hid. END
BEGIN NOW You have now the good advantage of the night. END
BEGIN NOW Have you not spoken 'gainst the Duke of Cornwall? END
BEGIN NOW He's coming hither; now, i' th' night, i' th' haste, And Regan with him. END
BEGIN NOW Have you nothing said Upon his party 'gainst the Duke of Albany? END
BEGIN NOW Advise yourself. END
BEGIN NOW I am sure on't, not a word. END
BEGIN NOW I hear my father coming. END
BEGIN NOW Pardon me! END
BEGIN NOW In cunning I must draw my sword upon you. END
BEGIN NOW Draw, seem to defend yourself; now quit you well.- Yield! END
BEGIN NOW Come before my father. END
BEGIN NOW Light, ho, here! END
BEGIN NOW Fly, brother.- Torches, torches!- So farewell. END
BEGIN NOW Exit Edgar. END
BEGIN NOW Some blood drawn on me would beget opinion Of my more fierce endeavour. END
BEGIN NOW I have seen drunkards Do more than this in sport.- Father, father!- Stop, stop! END
BEGIN NOW No help? END
BEGIN NOW Enter Gloucester, and Servants with torches. END
BEGIN NOW Now, Edmund, where's the villain? END
BEGIN NOW Here stood he in the dark, his sharp sword out, Mumbling of wicked charms, conjuring the moon To stand 's auspicious mistress. END
BEGIN NOW But where is he? END
BEGIN NOW Look, sir, I bleed. END
BEGIN NOW Where is the villain, Edmund? END
BEGIN NOW Fled this way, sir. END
BEGIN NOW When by no means he could- Pursue him, ho! END
BEGIN NOW Go after. END
BEGIN NOW By no means what? END
BEGIN NOW Persuade me to the murther of your lordship; But that I told him the revenging gods 'Gainst parricides did all their thunders bend; Spoke with how manifold and strong a bond The child was bound to th' father- sir, in fine, Seeing how loathly opposite I stood To his unnatural purpose, in fell motion With his prepared sword he charges home My unprovided body, lanch'd mine arm; But when he saw my best alarum'd spirits, Bold in the quarrel's right, rous'd to th' encounter, Or whether gasted by the noise I made, Full suddenly he fled. END
BEGIN NOW Let him fly far. END
BEGIN NOW Not in this land shall he remain uncaught; And found- dispatch. END
BEGIN NOW The noble Duke my master, My worthy arch and patron, comes to-night. END
BEGIN NOW By his authority I will proclaim it That he which find, him shall deserve our thanks, Bringing the murderous caitiff to the stake; He that conceals him, death. END
BEGIN NOW When I dissuaded him from his intent And found him pight to do it, with curst speech I threaten'd to discover him. END
BEGIN NOW He replied, 'Thou unpossessing bastard, dost thou think, If I would stand against thee, would the reposal Of any trust, virtue, or worth in thee Make thy words faith'd? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW What I should deny (As this I would; ay, though thou didst produce My very character), I'ld turn it all To thy suggestion, plot, and damned practice; And thou must make a dullard of the world, If they not thought the profits of my death Were very pregnant and potential spurs To make thee seek it.' END
BEGIN NOW Strong and fast'ned villain! END
BEGIN NOW Would he deny his letter? END
BEGIN NOW I never got him. END
BEGIN NOW Tucket within. END
BEGIN NOW Hark, the Duke's trumpets! END
BEGIN NOW I know not why he comes. END
BEGIN NOW All ports I'll bar; the villain shall not scape; The Duke must grant me that. END
BEGIN NOW Besides, his picture I will send far and near, that all the kingdom May have due note of him, and of my land, Loyal and natural boy, I'll work the means To make thee capable. END
BEGIN NOW Enter Cornwall, Regan, and Attendants. END
BEGIN NOW How now, my noble friend? END
BEGIN NOW Since I came hither (Which I can call but now) I have heard strange news. END
BEGIN NOW If it be true, all vengeance comes too short Which can pursue th' offender. END
BEGIN NOW How dost, my lord? END
BEGIN NOW O madam, my old heart is crack'd, it's crack'd! END
BEGIN NOW What, did my father's godson seek your life? END
BEGIN NOW He whom my father nam'd? END
BEGIN NOW Your Edgar? END
BEGIN NOW O lady, lady, shame would have it hid! END
BEGIN NOW Was he not companion with the riotous knights That tend upon my father? END
BEGIN NOW I know not, madam. END
BEGIN NOW 'Tis too bad, too bad! END
BEGIN NOW Yes, madam, he was of that consort. END
BEGIN NOW No marvel then though he were ill affected. END
BEGIN NOW 'Tis they have put him on the old man's death, To have th' expense and waste of his revenues. END
BEGIN NOW I have this present evening from my sister Been well inform'd of them, and with such cautions That, if they come to sojourn at my house, I'll not be there. END
BEGIN NOW Nor I, assure thee, Regan. END
BEGIN NOW Edmund, I hear that you have shown your father A childlike office. END
BEGIN NOW 'Twas my duty, sir. END
BEGIN NOW He did bewray his practice, and receiv'd This hurt you see, striving to apprehend him. END
BEGIN NOW Is he pursued? END
BEGIN NOW Ay, my good lord. END
BEGIN NOW If he be taken, he shall never more Be fear'd of doing harm. END
BEGIN NOW Make your own purpose, How in my strength you please. END
BEGIN NOW For you, Edmund, Whose virtue and obedience doth this instant So much commend itself, you shall be ours. END
BEGIN NOW Natures of such deep trust we shall much need; You we first seize on. END
BEGIN NOW I shall serve you, sir, Truly, however else. END
BEGIN NOW For him I thank your Grace. END
BEGIN NOW You know not why we came to visit you- Thus out of season, threading dark-ey'd night. END
BEGIN NOW Occasions, noble Gloucester, of some poise, Wherein we must have use of your advice. END
BEGIN NOW Our father he hath writ, so hath our sister, Of differences, which I best thought it fit To answer from our home. END
BEGIN NOW The several messengers From hence attend dispatch. END
BEGIN NOW Our good old friend, Lay comforts to your bosom, and bestow Your needful counsel to our business, Which craves the instant use. END
BEGIN NOW I serve you, madam. END
BEGIN NOW Your Graces are right welcome. END
BEGIN NOW Flourish. END
BEGIN NOW Scene II. END
BEGIN NOW Before Gloucester's Castle. END
BEGIN NOW Enter Kent and Steward, severally. END
BEGIN NOW Good dawning to thee, friend. END
BEGIN NOW Art of this house? END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Ay. END
BEGIN NOW Where may we set our horses? END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW I' th' mire. END
BEGIN NOW Prithee, if thou lov'st me, tell me. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW I love thee not. END
BEGIN NOW Why then, I care not for thee. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW If I had thee in Lipsbury Pinfold, I would make thee care for me. END
BEGIN NOW Why dost thou use me thus? END
BEGIN NOW I know thee not. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Fellow, I know thee. END
BEGIN NOW What dost thou know me for? END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW A knave; a rascal; an eater of broken meats; a base, proud, shallow, beggarly, three-suited, hundred-pound, filthy, worsted-stocking knave; a lily-liver'd, action-taking, whoreson, glass-gazing, superserviceable, finical rogue; one-trunk-inheriting slave; one that wouldst be a bawd in way of good service, and art nothing but the composition of a knave, beggar, coward, pander, and the son and heir of a mongrel bitch; one whom I will beat into clamorous whining, if thou deny the least syllable of thy addition. END
BEGIN NOW Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou, thus to rail on one that's neither known of thee nor knows thee! END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW What a brazen-fac'd varlet art thou, to deny thou knowest me! END
BEGIN NOW Is it two days ago since I beat thee and tripp'd up thy heels before the King? END
BEGIN NOW Draw, you rogue! END
BEGIN NOW for, though it be night, yet the moon shines. END
BEGIN NOW I'll make a sop o' th' moonshine o' you. END
BEGIN NOW Draw, you whoreson cullionly barbermonger! END
BEGIN NOW draw! END
BEGIN NOW Away! END
BEGIN NOW I have nothing to do with thee. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Draw, you rascal! END
BEGIN NOW You come with letters against the King, and take Vanity the puppet's part against the royalty of her father. END
BEGIN NOW Draw, you rogue, or I'll so carbonado your shanks! END
BEGIN NOW Draw, you rascal! END
BEGIN NOW Come your ways! END
BEGIN NOW Help, ho! END
BEGIN NOW murther! END
BEGIN NOW help! END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Strike, you slave! END
BEGIN NOW Stand, rogue! END
BEGIN NOW Stand, you neat slave! END
BEGIN NOW Strike! END
BEGIN NOW Help, ho! END
BEGIN NOW murther! END
BEGIN NOW murther! END
BEGIN NOW Enter Edmund, with his rapier drawn, Gloucester, Cornwall, Regan, Servants. END
BEGIN NOW How now? END
BEGIN NOW What's the matter? END
BEGIN NOW Parts Kent. END
BEGIN NOW With you, goodman boy, an you please! END
BEGIN NOW Come, I'll flesh ye! END
BEGIN NOW Come on, young master! END
BEGIN NOW Weapons? END
BEGIN NOW arms? END
BEGIN NOW What's the matter here? END
BEGIN NOW Keep peace, upon your lives! END
BEGIN NOW He dies that strikes again. END
BEGIN NOW What is the matter? END
BEGIN NOW The messengers from our sister and the King What is your difference? END
BEGIN NOW Speak. END
BEGIN NOW I am scarce in breath, my lord. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW No marvel, you have so bestirr'd your valour. END
BEGIN NOW You cowardly rascal, nature disclaims in thee; a tailor made thee. END
BEGIN NOW Thou art a strange fellow. END
BEGIN NOW A tailor make a man? END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Ay, a tailor, sir. END
BEGIN NOW A stonecutter or a painter could not have made him so ill, though he had been but two hours at the trade. END
BEGIN NOW Speak yet, how grew your quarrel? END
BEGIN NOW This ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have spar'd At suit of his grey beard- Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Thou whoreson zed! END
BEGIN NOW thou unnecessary letter! END
BEGIN NOW My lord, if you'll give me leave, I will tread this unbolted villain into mortar and daub the walls of a jakes with him. END
BEGIN NOW 'Spare my grey beard,' you wagtail? END
BEGIN NOW Peace, sirrah! END
BEGIN NOW You beastly knave, know you no reverence? END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, sir, but anger hath a privilege. END
BEGIN NOW Why art thou angry? END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW That such a slave as this should wear a sword, Who wears no honesty. END
BEGIN NOW Such smiling rogues as these, Like rats, oft bite the holy cords atwain Which are too intrinse t' unloose; smooth every passion That in the natures of their lords rebel, Bring oil to fire, snow to their colder moods; Renege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks With every gale and vary of their masters, Knowing naught (like dogs) but following. END
BEGIN NOW A plague upon your epileptic visage! END
BEGIN NOW Smile you my speeches, as I were a fool? END
BEGIN NOW Goose, an I had you upon Sarum Plain, I'ld drive ye cackling home to Camelot. END
BEGIN NOW What, art thou mad, old fellow? END
BEGIN NOW How fell you out? END
BEGIN NOW Say that. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW No contraries hold more antipathy Than I and such a knave. END
BEGIN NOW Why dost thou call him knave? END
BEGIN NOW What is his fault? END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW His countenance likes me not. END
BEGIN NOW No more perchance does mine, or his, or hers. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Sir, 'tis my occupation to be plain. END
BEGIN NOW I have seen better faces in my time Than stands on any shoulder that I see Before me at this instant. END
BEGIN NOW This is some fellow Who, having been prais'd for bluntness, doth affect A saucy roughness, and constrains the garb Quite from his nature. END
BEGIN NOW He cannot flatter, he! END
BEGIN NOW An honest mind and plain- he must speak truth! END
BEGIN NOW An they will take it, so; if not, he's plain. END
BEGIN NOW These kind of knaves I know which in this plainness Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends Than twenty silly-ducking observants That stretch their duties nicely. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Sir, in good faith, in sincere verity, Under th' allowance of your great aspect, Whose influence, like the wreath of radiant fire On flickering Phoebus' front- What mean'st by this? END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW To go out of my dialect, which you discommend so much. END
BEGIN NOW I know, sir, I am no flatterer. END
BEGIN NOW He that beguil'd you in a plain accent was a plain knave, which, for my part, I will not be, though I should win your displeasure to entreat me to't. END
BEGIN NOW What was th' offence you gave him? END
BEGIN NOW I never gave him any. END
BEGIN NOW It pleas'd the King his master very late To strike at me, upon his misconstruction; When he, conjunct, and flattering his displeasure, Tripp'd me behind; being down, insulted, rail'd And put upon him such a deal of man That worthied him, got praises of the King For him attempting who was self-subdu'd; And, in the fleshment of this dread exploit, Drew on me here again. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW None of these rogues and cowards But Ajax is their fool. END
BEGIN NOW Fetch forth the stocks! END
BEGIN NOW You stubborn ancient knave, you reverent braggart, We'll teach you- Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Sir, I am too old to learn. END
BEGIN NOW Call not your stocks for me. END
BEGIN NOW I serve the King; On whose employment I was sent to you. END
BEGIN NOW You shall do small respect, show too bold malice Against the grace and person of my master, Stocking his messenger. END
BEGIN NOW Fetch forth the stocks! END
BEGIN NOW As I have life and honour, There shall he sit till noon. END
BEGIN NOW Till noon? END
BEGIN NOW Till night, my lord, and all night too! END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Why, madam, if I were your father's dog, You should not use me so. END
BEGIN NOW Sir, being his knave, I will. END
BEGIN NOW This is a fellow of the selfsame colour Our sister speaks of. END
BEGIN NOW Come, bring away the stocks! END
BEGIN NOW Stocks brought out. END
BEGIN NOW Let me beseech your Grace not to do so. END
BEGIN NOW His fault is much, and the good King his master Will check him for't. END
BEGIN NOW Your purpos'd low correction Is such as basest and contemn'dest wretches For pilf'rings and most common trespasses Are punish'd with. END
BEGIN NOW The King must take it ill That he, so slightly valued in his messenger, Should have him thus restrain'd. END
BEGIN NOW I'll answer that. END
BEGIN NOW My sister may receive it much more worse, To have her gentleman abus'd, assaulted, For following her affairs. END
BEGIN NOW Put in his legs.- Come, my good lord, away. END
BEGIN NOW Exeunt I am sorry for thee, friend. END
BEGIN NOW 'Tis the Duke's pleasure, Whose disposition, all the world well knows, Will not be rubb'd nor stopp'd. END
BEGIN NOW I'll entreat for thee. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Pray do not, sir. END
BEGIN NOW I have watch'd and travell'd hard. END
BEGIN NOW Some time I shall sleep out, the rest I'll whistle. END
BEGIN NOW A good man's fortune may grow out at heels. END
BEGIN NOW Give you good morrow! END
BEGIN NOW The Duke 's to blame in this; 'twill be ill taken. END
BEGIN NOW Exit. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Good King, that must approve the common saw, Thou out of heaven's benediction com'st To the warm sun! END
BEGIN NOW Approach, thou beacon to this under globe, That by thy comfortable beams I may Peruse this letter. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing almost sees miracles But misery. END
BEGIN NOW I know 'tis from Cordelia, Who hath most fortunately been inform'd Of my obscured course- and 'shall find time From this enormous state, seeking to give Losses their remedies'- All weary and o'erwatch'd, Take vantage, heavy eyes, not to behold This shameful lodging. END
BEGIN NOW Fortune, good night; smile once more, turn thy wheel. END
BEGIN NOW Sleeps. END
BEGIN NOW Scene III. END
BEGIN NOW The open country. END
BEGIN NOW Enter Edgar. END
BEGIN NOW I heard myself proclaim'd, And by the happy hollow of a tree Escap'd the hunt. END
BEGIN NOW No port is free, no place That guard and most unusual vigilance Does not attend my taking. END
BEGIN NOW Whiles I may scape, I will preserve myself; and am bethought To take the basest and most poorest shape That ever penury, in contempt of man, Brought near to beast. END
BEGIN NOW My face I'll grime with filth, Blanket my loins, elf all my hair in knots, And with presented nakedness outface The winds and persecutions of the sky. END
BEGIN NOW The country gives me proof and precedent Of Bedlam beggars, who, with roaring voices, Strike in their numb'd and mortified bare arms Pins, wooden pricks, nails, sprigs of rosemary; And with this horrible object, from low farms, Poor pelting villages, sheepcotes, and mills, Sometime with lunatic bans, sometime with prayers, Enforce their charity. END
BEGIN NOW 'Poor Turlygod! END
BEGIN NOW poor Tom!' END
BEGIN NOW That's something yet! END
BEGIN NOW Edgar I nothing am. END
BEGIN NOW Exit. END
BEGIN NOW Scene IV. END
BEGIN NOW Before Gloucester's Castle; Kent in the stocks. END
BEGIN NOW Enter Lear, Fool, and Gentleman. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW 'Tis strange that they should so depart from home, And not send back my messenger. END
BEGIN NOW As I learn'd, The night before there was no purpose in them Of this remove. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Hail to thee, noble master! END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Ha! END
BEGIN NOW Mak'st thou this shame thy pastime? END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW No, my lord. END
BEGIN NOW Fool. END
BEGIN NOW Ha, ha! END
BEGIN NOW look! END
BEGIN NOW he wears cruel garters. END
BEGIN NOW Horses are tied by the head, dogs and bears by th' neck, monkeys by th' loins, and men by th' legs. END
BEGIN NOW When a man's over-lusty at legs, then he wears wooden nether-stocks. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW What's he that hath so much thy place mistook To set thee here? END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW It is both he and she- Your son and daughter. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW No, I say. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW I say yea. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW No, no, they would not! END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, they have. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW By Jupiter, I swear no! END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW By Juno, I swear ay! END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW They durst not do't; They would not, could not do't. END
BEGIN NOW 'Tis worse than murther To do upon respect such violent outrage. END
BEGIN NOW Resolve me with all modest haste which way Thou mightst deserve or they impose this usage, Coming from us. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW My lord, when at their home I did commend your Highness' letters to them, Ere I was risen from the place that show'd My duty kneeling, came there a reeking post, Stew'd in his haste, half breathless, panting forth From Goneril his mistress salutations; Deliver'd letters, spite of intermission, Which presently they read; on whose contents, They summon'd up their meiny, straight took horse, Commanded me to follow and attend The leisure of their answer, gave me cold looks, And meeting here the other messenger, Whose welcome I perceiv'd had poison'd mine- Being the very fellow which of late Display'd so saucily against your Highness- Having more man than wit about me, drew. END
BEGIN NOW He rais'd the house with loud and coward cries. END
BEGIN NOW Your son and daughter found this trespass worth The shame which here it suffers. END
BEGIN NOW Fool. END
BEGIN NOW Winter's not gone yet, if the wild geese fly that way. END
BEGIN NOW Fathers that wear rags Do make their children blind; But fathers that bear bags Shall see their children kind. END
BEGIN NOW Fortune, that arrant whore, Ne'er turns the key to th' poor. END
BEGIN NOW But for all this, thou shalt have as many dolours for thy daughters as thou canst tell in a year. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW O, how this mother swells up toward my heart! END
BEGIN NOW Hysterica passio! END
BEGIN NOW Down, thou climbing sorrow! END
BEGIN NOW Thy element's below! END
BEGIN NOW Where is this daughter? END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW With the Earl, sir, here within. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Follow me not; Stay here. END
BEGIN NOW Exit. END
BEGIN NOW Made you no more offence but what you speak of? END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW None. END
BEGIN NOW How chance the King comes with so small a number? END
BEGIN NOW Fool. END
BEGIN NOW An thou hadst been set i' th' stocks for that question, thou'dst well deserv'd it. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Why, fool? END
BEGIN NOW Fool. END
BEGIN NOW We'll set thee to school to an ant, to teach thee there's no labouring i' th' winter. END
BEGIN NOW All that follow their noses are led by their eyes but blind men, and there's not a nose among twenty but can smell him that's stinking. END
BEGIN NOW Let go thy hold when a great wheel runs down a hill, lest it break thy neck with following it; but the great one that goes upward, let him draw thee after. END
BEGIN NOW When a wise man gives thee better counsel, give me mine again. END
BEGIN NOW I would have none but knaves follow it, since a fool gives it. END
BEGIN NOW That sir which serves and seeks for gain, And follows but for form, Will pack when it begins to rain And leave thee in the storm. END
BEGIN NOW But I will tarry; the fool will stay, And let the wise man fly. END
BEGIN NOW The knave turns fool that runs away; The fool no knave, perdy. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Where learn'd you this, fool? END
BEGIN NOW Fool. END
BEGIN NOW Not i' th' stocks, fool. END
BEGIN NOW Enter Lear and Gloucester Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Deny to speak with me? END
BEGIN NOW They are sick? END
BEGIN NOW they are weary? END
BEGIN NOW They have travell'd all the night? END
BEGIN NOW Mere fetches- The images of revolt and flying off! END
BEGIN NOW Fetch me a better answer. END
BEGIN NOW My dear lord, You know the fiery quality of the Duke, How unremovable and fix'd he is In his own course. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Vengeance! END
BEGIN NOW plague! END
BEGIN NOW death! END
BEGIN NOW confusion! END
BEGIN NOW Fiery? END
BEGIN NOW What quality? END
BEGIN NOW Why, Gloucester, Gloucester, I'ld speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife. END
BEGIN NOW Well, my good lord, I have inform'd them so. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Inform'd them? END
BEGIN NOW Dost thou understand me, man? END
BEGIN NOW Ay, my good lord. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW The King would speak with Cornwall; the dear father Would with his daughter speak, commands her service. END
BEGIN NOW Are they inform'd of this? END
BEGIN NOW My breath and blood! END
BEGIN NOW Fiery? END
BEGIN NOW the fiery Duke? END
BEGIN NOW Tell the hot Duke that- No, but not yet! END
BEGIN NOW May be he is not well. END
BEGIN NOW Infirmity doth still neglect all office Whereto our health is bound. END
BEGIN NOW We are not ourselves When nature, being oppress'd, commands the mind To suffer with the body. END
BEGIN NOW I'll forbear; And am fallen out with my more headier will, To take the indispos'd and sickly fit For the sound man.- Death on my state! END
BEGIN NOW Wherefore Should be sit here? END
BEGIN NOW This act persuades me That this remotion of the Duke and her Is practice only. END
BEGIN NOW Give me my servant forth. END
BEGIN NOW Go tell the Duke and 's wife I'ld speak with them- Now, presently. END
BEGIN NOW Bid them come forth and hear me, Or at their chamber door I'll beat the drum Till it cry sleep to death. END
BEGIN NOW I would have all well betwixt you. END
BEGIN NOW Exit. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW O me, my heart, my rising heart! END
BEGIN NOW But down! END
BEGIN NOW Fool. END
BEGIN NOW Cry to it, nuncle, as the cockney did to the eels when she put 'em i' th' paste alive. END
BEGIN NOW She knapp'd 'em o' th' coxcombs with a stick and cried 'Down, wantons, down!' END
BEGIN NOW 'Twas her brother that, in pure kindness to his horse, buttered his hay. END
BEGIN NOW Enter Cornwall, Regan, Gloucester, Servants. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Good morrow to you both. END
BEGIN NOW Hail to your Grace! END
BEGIN NOW Kent here set at liberty. END
BEGIN NOW I am glad to see your Highness. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Regan, I think you are; I know what reason I have to think so. END
BEGIN NOW If thou shouldst not be glad, I would divorce me from thy mother's tomb, Sepulchring an adultress. END
BEGIN NOW O, are you free? END
BEGIN NOW Some other time for that.- Beloved Regan, Thy sister's naught. END
BEGIN NOW O Regan, she hath tied Sharp-tooth'd unkindness, like a vulture, here! END
BEGIN NOW I can scarce speak to thee. END
BEGIN NOW Thou'lt not believe With how deprav'd a quality- O Regan! END
BEGIN NOW I pray you, sir, take patience. END
BEGIN NOW I have hope You less know how to value her desert Than she to scant her duty. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Say, how is that? END
BEGIN NOW I cannot think my sister in the least Would fail her obligation. END
BEGIN NOW If, sir, perchance She have restrain'd the riots of your followers, 'Tis on such ground, and to such wholesome end, As clears her from all blame. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW My curses on her! END
BEGIN NOW O, sir, you are old! END
BEGIN NOW Nature in you stands on the very verge Of her confine. END
BEGIN NOW You should be rul'd, and led By some discretion that discerns your state Better than you yourself. END
BEGIN NOW Therefore I pray you That to our sister you do make return; Say you have wrong'd her, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Ask her forgiveness? END
BEGIN NOW Do you but mark how this becomes the house: 'Dear daughter, I confess that I am old. END
BEGIN NOW Age is unnecessary. END
BEGIN NOW On my knees I beg That you'll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food.' END
BEGIN NOW Good sir, no more! END
BEGIN NOW These are unsightly tricks. END
BEGIN NOW Return you to my sister. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Never, Regan! END
BEGIN NOW She hath abated me of half my train; Look'd black upon me; struck me with her tongue, Most serpent-like, upon the very heart. END
BEGIN NOW All the stor'd vengeances of heaven fall On her ingrateful top! END
BEGIN NOW Strike her young bones, You taking airs, with lameness! END
BEGIN NOW Fie, sir, fie! END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames Into her scornful eyes! END
BEGIN NOW Infect her beauty, You fen-suck'd fogs, drawn by the pow'rful sun, To fall and blast her pride! END
BEGIN NOW O the blest gods! END
BEGIN NOW so will you wish on me When the rash mood is on. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse. END
BEGIN NOW Thy tender-hefted nature shall not give Thee o'er to harshness. END
BEGIN NOW Her eyes are fierce; but thine Do comfort, and not burn. END
BEGIN NOW 'Tis not in thee To grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train, To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes, And, in conclusion, to oppose the bolt Against my coming in. END
BEGIN NOW Thou better know'st The offices of nature, bond of childhood, Effects of courtesy, dues of gratitude. END
BEGIN NOW Thy half o' th' kingdom hast thou not forgot, Wherein I thee endow'd. END
BEGIN NOW Good sir, to th' purpose. END
BEGIN NOW Tucket within. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Who put my man i' th' stocks? END
BEGIN NOW What trumpet's that? END
BEGIN NOW I know't- my sister's. END
BEGIN NOW This approves her letter, That she would soon be here. END
BEGIN NOW Enter Steward. END
BEGIN NOW Is your lady come? END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW This is a slave, whose easy-borrowed pride Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows. END
BEGIN NOW Out, varlet, from my sight! END
BEGIN NOW What means your Grace? END
BEGIN NOW Enter Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Who stock'd my servant? END
BEGIN NOW Regan, I have good hope Thou didst not know on't.- Who comes here? END
BEGIN NOW O heavens! END
BEGIN NOW If you do love old men, if your sweet sway Allow obedience- if yourselves are old, Make it your cause! END
BEGIN NOW Send down, and take my part! END
BEGIN NOW Art not asham'd to look upon this beard?- O Regan, wilt thou take her by the hand? END
BEGIN NOW Why not by th' hand, sir? END
BEGIN NOW How have I offended? END
BEGIN NOW All's not offence that indiscretion finds And dotage terms so. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW O sides, you are too tough! END
BEGIN NOW Will you yet hold? END
BEGIN NOW How came my man i' th' stocks? END
BEGIN NOW I set him there, sir; but his own disorders Deserv'd much less advancement. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW You? END
BEGIN NOW Did you? END
BEGIN NOW I pray you, father, being weak, seem so. END
BEGIN NOW If, till the expiration of your month, You will return and sojourn with my sister, Dismissing half your train, come then to me. END
BEGIN NOW I am now from home, and out of that provision Which shall be needful for your entertainment. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Return to her, and fifty men dismiss'd? END
BEGIN NOW No, rather I abjure all roofs, and choose To wage against the enmity o' th' air, To be a comrade with the wolf and owl- Necessity's sharp pinch! END
BEGIN NOW Return with her? END
BEGIN NOW Why, the hot-blooded France, that dowerless took Our youngest born, I could as well be brought To knee his throne, and, squire-like, pension beg To keep base life afoot. END
BEGIN NOW Return with her? END
BEGIN NOW Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter To this detested groom. END
BEGIN NOW At your choice, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad. END
BEGIN NOW I will not trouble thee, my child; farewell. END
BEGIN NOW We'll no more meet, no more see one another. END
BEGIN NOW But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter; Or rather a disease that's in my flesh, Which I must needs call mine. END
BEGIN NOW Thou art a boil, A plague sore, an embossed carbuncle In my corrupted blood. END
BEGIN NOW But I'll not chide thee. END
BEGIN NOW Let shame come when it will, I do not call it. END
BEGIN NOW I do not bid the Thunder-bearer shoot Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove. END
BEGIN NOW Mend when thou canst; be better at thy leisure; I can be patient, I can stay with Regan, I and my hundred knights. END
BEGIN NOW Not altogether so. END
BEGIN NOW I look'd not for you yet, nor am provided For your fit welcome. END
BEGIN NOW Give ear, sir, to my sister; For those that mingle reason with your passion Must be content to think you old, and so- But she knows what she does. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Is this well spoken? END
BEGIN NOW I dare avouch it, sir. END
BEGIN NOW What, fifty followers? END
BEGIN NOW Is it not well? END
BEGIN NOW What should you need of more? END
BEGIN NOW Yea, or so many, sith that both charge and danger Speak 'gainst so great a number? END
BEGIN NOW How in one house Should many people, under two commands, Hold amity? END
BEGIN NOW 'Tis hard; almost impossible. END
BEGIN NOW Why might not you, my lord, receive attendance From those that she calls servants, or from mine? END
BEGIN NOW Why not, my lord? END
BEGIN NOW If then they chanc'd to slack ye, We could control them. END
BEGIN NOW If you will come to me (For now I spy a danger), I entreat you To bring but five-and-twenty. END
BEGIN NOW To no more Will I give place or notice. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW I gave you all- And in good time you gave it! END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Made you my guardians, my depositaries; But kept a reservation to be followed With such a number. END
BEGIN NOW What, must I come to you With five-and-twenty, Regan? END
BEGIN NOW Said you so? END
BEGIN NOW And speak't again my lord. END
BEGIN NOW No more with me. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Those wicked creatures yet do look well-favour'd When others are more wicked; not being the worst Stands in some rank of praise. END
BEGIN NOW I'll go with thee. END
BEGIN NOW Thy fifty yet doth double five-and-twenty, And thou art twice her love. END
BEGIN NOW Hear, me, my lord. END
BEGIN NOW What need you five-and-twenty, ten, or five, To follow in a house where twice so many Have a command to tend you? END
BEGIN NOW What need one? END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW O, reason not the need! END
BEGIN NOW Our basest beggars Are in the poorest thing superfluous. END
BEGIN NOW Allow not nature more than nature needs, Man's life is cheap as beast's. END
BEGIN NOW Thou art a lady: If only to go warm were gorgeous, Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st Which scarcely keeps thee warm. END
BEGIN NOW But, for true need- You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need! END
BEGIN NOW You see me here, you gods, a poor old man, As full of grief as age; wretched in both. END
BEGIN NOW If it be you that stirs these daughters' hearts Against their father, fool me not so much To bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger, And let not women's weapons, water drops, Stain my man's cheeks! END
BEGIN NOW No, you unnatural hags! END
BEGIN NOW I will have such revenges on you both That all the world shall- I will do such things- What they are yet, I know not; but they shall be The terrors of the earth! END
BEGIN NOW You think I'll weep. END
BEGIN NOW No, I'll not weep. END
BEGIN NOW I have full cause of weeping, but this heart Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws Or ere I'll weep. END
BEGIN NOW O fool, I shall go mad! END
BEGIN NOW Exeunt Lear, Gloucester, Kent, and Fool. END
BEGIN NOW Storm and tempest. END
BEGIN NOW Let us withdraw; 'twill be a storm. END
BEGIN NOW This house is little; the old man and 's people Cannot be well bestow'd. END
BEGIN NOW 'Tis his own blame; hath put himself from rest And must needs taste his folly. END
BEGIN NOW For his particular, I'll receive him gladly, But not one follower. END
BEGIN NOW So am I purpos'd. END
BEGIN NOW Where is my Lord of Gloucester? END
BEGIN NOW Followed the old man forth. END
BEGIN NOW Enter Gloucester. END
BEGIN NOW He is return'd. END
BEGIN NOW The King is in high rage. END
BEGIN NOW Whither is he going? END
BEGIN NOW He calls to horse, but will I know not whither. END
BEGIN NOW 'Tis best to give him way; he leads himself. END
BEGIN NOW My lord, entreat him by no means to stay. END
BEGIN NOW Alack, the night comes on, and the bleak winds Do sorely ruffle. END
BEGIN NOW For many miles about There's scarce a bush. END
BEGIN NOW O, sir, to wilful men The injuries that they themselves procure Must be their schoolmasters. END
BEGIN NOW Shut up your doors. END
BEGIN NOW He is attended with a desperate train, And what they may incense him to, being apt To have his ear abus'd, wisdom bids fear. END
BEGIN NOW Shut up your doors, my lord: 'tis a wild night. END
BEGIN NOW My Regan counsels well. END
BEGIN NOW Come out o' th' storm. END
BEGIN NOW ACT III. END
BEGIN NOW Scene I. END
BEGIN NOW A heath. END
BEGIN NOW Storm still. END
BEGIN NOW Enter Kent and a Gentleman at several doors. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Who's there, besides foul weather? END
BEGIN NOW One minded like the weather, most unquietly. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW I know you. END
BEGIN NOW Where's the King? END
BEGIN NOW Contending with the fretful elements; Bids the wind blow the earth into the sea, Or swell the curled waters 'bove the main, That things might change or cease; tears his white hair, Which the impetuous blasts, with eyeless rage, Catch in their fury and make nothing of; Strives in his little world of man to outscorn The to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain. END
BEGIN NOW This night, wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch, The lion and the belly-pinched wolf Keep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs, And bids what will take all. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW But who is with him? END
BEGIN NOW None but the fool, who labours to outjest His heart-struck injuries. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Sir, I do know you, And dare upon the warrant of my note Commend a dear thing to you. END
BEGIN NOW There is division (Although as yet the face of it be cover'd With mutual cunning) 'twixt Albany and Cornwall; Who have (as who have not, that their great stars Thron'd and set high?) END
BEGIN NOW servants, who seem no less, Which are to France the spies and speculations Intelligent of our state. END
BEGIN NOW What hath been seen, Either in snuffs and packings of the Dukes, Or the hard rein which both of them have borne Against the old kind King, or something deeper, Whereof, perchance, these are but furnishings- But, true it is, from France there comes a power Into this scattered kingdom, who already, Wise in our negligence, have secret feet In some of our best ports and are at point To show their open banner. END
BEGIN NOW Now to you: If on my credit you dare build so far To make your speed to Dover, you shall find Some that will thank you, making just report Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow The King hath cause to plain. END
BEGIN NOW I am a gentleman of blood and breeding, And from some knowledge and assurance offer This office to you. END
BEGIN NOW I will talk further with you. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW No, do not. END
BEGIN NOW For confirmation that I am much more Than my out-wall, open this purse and take What it contains. END
BEGIN NOW If you shall see Cordelia (As fear not but you shall), show her this ring, And she will tell you who your fellow is That yet you do not know. END
BEGIN NOW Fie on this storm! END
BEGIN NOW I will go seek the King. END
BEGIN NOW Give me your hand. END
BEGIN NOW Have you no more to say? END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Few words, but, to effect, more than all yet: That, when we have found the King (in which your pain That way, I'll this), he that first lights on him Holla the other. END
BEGIN NOW Exeunt Scene II. END
BEGIN NOW Another part of the heath. END
BEGIN NOW Storm still. END
BEGIN NOW Enter Lear and Fool. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! END
BEGIN NOW rage! END
BEGIN NOW blow! END
BEGIN NOW You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout Till you have drench'd our steeples, drown'd the cocks! END
BEGIN NOW You sulph'rous and thought-executing fires, Vaunt-couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts, Singe my white head! END
BEGIN NOW And thou, all-shaking thunder, Strike flat the thick rotundity o' th' world, Crack Nature's moulds, all germains spill at once, That makes ingrateful man! END
BEGIN NOW Fool. END
BEGIN NOW O nuncle, court holy water in a dry house is better than this rain water out o' door. END
BEGIN NOW Good nuncle, in, and ask thy daughters blessing! END
BEGIN NOW Here's a night pities nether wise men nor fools. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Rumble thy bellyful! END
BEGIN NOW Spit, fire! END
BEGIN NOW spout, rain! END
BEGIN NOW Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire are my daughters. END
BEGIN NOW I tax not you, you elements, with unkindness. END
BEGIN NOW I never gave you kingdom, call'd you children, You owe me no subscription. END
BEGIN NOW Then let fall Your horrible pleasure. END
BEGIN NOW Here I stand your slave, A poor, infirm, weak, and despis'd old man. END
BEGIN NOW But yet I call you servile ministers, That will with two pernicious daughters join Your high-engender'd battles 'gainst a head So old and white as this! END
BEGIN NOW O! END
BEGIN NOW O! END
BEGIN NOW 'tis foul! END
BEGIN NOW Fool. END
BEGIN NOW He that has a house to put 's head in has a good head-piece. END
BEGIN NOW The codpiece that will house Before the head has any, The head and he shall louse: So beggars marry many. END
BEGIN NOW The man that makes his toe What he his heart should make Shall of a corn cry woe, And turn his sleep to wake. END
BEGIN NOW For there was never yet fair woman but she made mouths in a glass. END
BEGIN NOW Enter Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW No, I will be the pattern of all patience; I will say nothing. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Who's there? END
BEGIN NOW Fool. END
BEGIN NOW Marry, here's grace and a codpiece; that's a wise man and a fool. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Alas, sir, are you here? END
BEGIN NOW Things that love night Love not such nights as these. END
BEGIN NOW The wrathful skies Gallow the very wanderers of the dark And make them keep their caves. END
BEGIN NOW Since I was man, Such sheets of fire, such bursts of horrid thunder, Such groans of roaring wind and rain, I never Remember to have heard. END
BEGIN NOW Man's nature cannot carry Th' affliction nor the fear. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Let the great gods, That keep this dreadful pudder o'er our heads, Find out their enemies now. END
BEGIN NOW Tremble, thou wretch, That hast within thee undivulged crimes Unwhipp'd of justice. END
BEGIN NOW Hide thee, thou bloody hand; Thou perjur'd, and thou simular man of virtue That art incestuous. END
BEGIN NOW Caitiff, in pieces shake That under covert and convenient seeming Hast practis'd on man's life. END
BEGIN NOW Close pent-up guilts, Rive your concealing continents, and cry These dreadful summoners grace. END
BEGIN NOW I am a man More sinn'd against than sinning. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Alack, bareheaded? END
BEGIN NOW Gracious my lord, hard by here is a hovel; Some friendship will it lend you 'gainst the tempest. END
BEGIN NOW Repose you there, whilst I to this hard house (More harder than the stones whereof 'tis rais'd, Which even but now, demanding after you, Denied me to come in) return, and force Their scanted courtesy. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW My wits begin to turn. END
BEGIN NOW Come on, my boy. END
BEGIN NOW How dost, my boy? END
BEGIN NOW Art cold? END
BEGIN NOW I am cold myself. END
BEGIN NOW Where is this straw, my fellow? END
BEGIN NOW The art of our necessities is strange, That can make vile things precious. END
BEGIN NOW Come, your hovel. END
BEGIN NOW Poor fool and knave, I have one part in my heart That's sorry yet for thee. END
BEGIN NOW Fool. END
BEGIN NOW He that has and a little tiny wit- With hey, ho, the wind and the rain- Must make content with his fortunes fit, For the rain it raineth every day. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW True, my good boy. END
BEGIN NOW Come, bring us to this hovel. END
BEGIN NOW Exeunt Fool. END
BEGIN NOW This is a brave night to cool a courtesan. END
BEGIN NOW I'll speak a prophecy ere I go: When priests are more in word than matter; When brewers mar their malt with water; When nobles are their tailors' tutors, No heretics burn'd, but wenches' suitors; When every case in law is right, No squire in debt nor no poor knight; When slanders do not live in tongues, Nor cutpurses come not to throngs; When usurers tell their gold i' th' field, And bawds and whores do churches build: Then shall the realm of Albion Come to great confusion. END
BEGIN NOW Then comes the time, who lives to see't, That going shall be us'd with feet. END
BEGIN NOW This prophecy Merlin shall make, for I live before his time. END
BEGIN NOW Exit. END
BEGIN NOW Scene III. END
BEGIN NOW Gloucester's Castle. END
BEGIN NOW Enter Gloucester and Edmund. END
BEGIN NOW Alack, alack, Edmund, I like not this unnatural dealing! END
BEGIN NOW When I desir'd their leave that I might pity him, they took from me the use of mine own house, charg'd me on pain of perpetual displeasure neither to speak of him, entreat for him, nor any way sustain him. END
BEGIN NOW Most savage and unnatural! END
BEGIN NOW Go to; say you nothing. END
BEGIN NOW There is division betwixt the Dukes, and a worse matter than that. END
BEGIN NOW I have received a letter this night- 'tis dangerous to be spoken- I have lock'd the letter in my closet. END
BEGIN NOW These injuries the King now bears will be revenged home; there's part of a power already footed; we must incline to the King. END
BEGIN NOW I will seek him and privily relieve him. END
BEGIN NOW Go you and maintain talk with the Duke, that my charity be not of him perceived. END
BEGIN NOW If he ask for me, I am ill and gone to bed. END
BEGIN NOW Though I die for't, as no less is threat'ned me, the King my old master must be relieved. END
BEGIN NOW There is some strange thing toward, Edmund. END
BEGIN NOW Pray you be careful. END
BEGIN NOW Exit. END
BEGIN NOW This courtesy, forbid thee, shall the Duke Instantly know, and of that letter too. END
BEGIN NOW This seems a fair deserving, and must draw me That which my father loses- no less than all. END
BEGIN NOW The younger rises when the old doth fall. END
BEGIN NOW Exit. END
BEGIN NOW Scene IV. END
BEGIN NOW The heath. END
BEGIN NOW Before a hovel. END
BEGIN NOW Storm still. END
BEGIN NOW Enter Lear, Kent, and Fool. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Here is the place, my lord. END
BEGIN NOW Good my lord, enter. END
BEGIN NOW The tyranny of the open night 's too rough For nature to endure. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Let me alone. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Good my lord, enter here. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Wilt break my heart? END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW I had rather break mine own. END
BEGIN NOW Good my lord, enter. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Thou think'st 'tis much that this contentious storm Invades us to the skin. END
BEGIN NOW So 'tis to thee; But where the greater malady is fix'd, The lesser is scarce felt. END
BEGIN NOW Thou'dst shun a bear; But if thy flight lay toward the raging sea, Thou'dst meet the bear i' th' mouth. END
BEGIN NOW When the mind's free, The body's delicate. END
BEGIN NOW The tempest in my mind Doth from my senses take all feeling else Save what beats there. END
BEGIN NOW Filial ingratitude! END
BEGIN NOW Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand For lifting food to't? END
BEGIN NOW But I will punish home! END
BEGIN NOW No, I will weep no more. END
BEGIN NOW In such a night 'To shut me out! END
BEGIN NOW Pour on; I will endure. END
BEGIN NOW In such a night as this! END
BEGIN NOW O Regan, Goneril! END
BEGIN NOW Your old kind father, whose frank heart gave all! END
BEGIN NOW O, that way madness lies; let me shun that! END
BEGIN NOW No more of that. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Good my lord, enter here. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Prithee go in thyself; seek thine own ease. END
BEGIN NOW This tempest will not give me leave to ponder On things would hurt me more. END
BEGIN NOW But I'll go in. END
BEGIN NOW In, boy; go first.- You houseless poverty- Nay, get thee in. END
BEGIN NOW I'll pray, and then I'll sleep. END
BEGIN NOW Exit Poor naked wretches, wheresoe'er you are, That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm, How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides, Your loop'd and window'd raggedness, defend you From seasons such as these? END
BEGIN NOW O, I have ta'en Too little care of this! END
BEGIN NOW Take physic, pomp; Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel, That thou mayst shake the superflux to them And show the heavens more just. END
BEGIN NOW Fathom and half, fathom and half! END
BEGIN NOW Poor Tom! END
BEGIN NOW Enter Fool Fool. END
BEGIN NOW Come not in here, nuncle, here's a spirit. END
BEGIN NOW Help me, help me! END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Give me thy hand. END
BEGIN NOW Who's there? END
BEGIN NOW Fool. END
BEGIN NOW A spirit, a spirit! END
BEGIN NOW He says his name's poor Tom. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW What art thou that dost grumble there i' th' straw? END
BEGIN NOW Come forth. END
BEGIN NOW Enter Edgar Away! END
BEGIN NOW the foul fiend follows me! END
BEGIN NOW Through the sharp hawthorn blows the cold wind. END
BEGIN NOW Humh! END
BEGIN NOW go to thy cold bed, and warm thee. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Hast thou given all to thy two daughters, and art thou come to this? END
BEGIN NOW Who gives anything to poor Tom? END
BEGIN NOW whom the foul fiend hath led through fire and through flame, through ford and whirlpool, o'er bog and quagmire; that hath laid knives under his pillow and halters in his pew, set ratsbane by his porridge, made him proud of heart, to ride on a bay trotting horse over four-inch'd bridges, to course his own shadow for a traitor. END
BEGIN NOW Bless thy five wits! END
BEGIN NOW Tom 's acold. END
BEGIN NOW O, do de, do de, do de. END
BEGIN NOW Bless thee from whirlwinds, star-blasting, and taking! END
BEGIN NOW Do poor Tom some charity, whom the foul fiend vexes. END
BEGIN NOW There could I have him now- and there- and there again- and there! END
BEGIN NOW Storm still. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW What, have his daughters brought him to this pass? END
BEGIN NOW Couldst thou save nothing? END
BEGIN NOW Didst thou give 'em all? END
BEGIN NOW Fool. END
BEGIN NOW Nay, he reserv'd a blanket, else we had been all sham'd. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Now all the plagues that in the pendulous air Hang fated o'er men's faults light on thy daughters! END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW He hath no daughters, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Death, traitor! END
BEGIN NOW nothing could have subdu'd nature To such a lowness but his unkind daughters. END
BEGIN NOW Is it the fashion that discarded fathers Should have thus little mercy on their flesh? END
BEGIN NOW Judicious punishment! END
BEGIN NOW 'Twas this flesh begot Those pelican daughters. END
BEGIN NOW Pillicock sat on Pillicock's Hill. END
BEGIN NOW 'Allow, 'allow, loo, loo! END
BEGIN NOW Fool. END
BEGIN NOW This cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen. END
BEGIN NOW Take heed o' th' foul fiend; obey thy parents: keep thy word justly; swear not; commit not with man's sworn spouse; set not thy sweet heart on proud array. END
BEGIN NOW Tom 's acold. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW What hast thou been? END
BEGIN NOW A servingman, proud in heart and mind; that curl'd my hair, wore gloves in my cap; serv'd the lust of my mistress' heart and did the act of darkness with her; swore as many oaths as I spake words, and broke them in the sweet face of heaven; one that slept in the contriving of lust, and wak'd to do it. END
BEGIN NOW Wine lov'd I deeply, dice dearly; and in woman out-paramour'd the Turk. END
BEGIN NOW False of heart, light of ear, bloody of hand; hog in sloth, fox in stealth, wolf in greediness, dog in madness, lion in prey. END
BEGIN NOW Let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling of silks betray thy poor heart to woman. END
BEGIN NOW Keep thy foot out of brothel, thy hand out of placket, thy pen from lender's book, and defy the foul fiend. END
BEGIN NOW Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind; says suum, mun, hey, no, nonny. END
BEGIN NOW Dolphin my boy, my boy, sessa! END
BEGIN NOW let him trot by. END
BEGIN NOW Storm still. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Why, thou wert better in thy grave than to answer with thy uncover'd body this extremity of the skies. END
BEGIN NOW Is man no more than this? END
BEGIN NOW Consider him well. END
BEGIN NOW Thou ow'st the worm no silk, the beast no hide, the sheep no wool, the cat no perfume. END
BEGIN NOW Ha! END
BEGIN NOW Here's three on's are sophisticated! END
BEGIN NOW Thou art the thing itself; unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor, bare, forked animal as thou art. END
BEGIN NOW Off, off, you lendings! END
BEGIN NOW Come, unbutton here. END
BEGIN NOW Fool. END
BEGIN NOW Prithee, nuncle, be contented! END
BEGIN NOW 'Tis a naughty night to swim in. END
BEGIN NOW Now a little fire in a wild field were like an old lecher's heart- a small spark, all the rest on's body cold. END
BEGIN NOW Look, here comes a walking fire. END
BEGIN NOW Enter Gloucester with a torch. END
BEGIN NOW This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet. END
BEGIN NOW He begins at curfew, and walks till the first cock. END
BEGIN NOW He gives the web and the pin, squints the eye, and makes the harelip; mildews the white wheat, and hurts the poor creature of earth. END
BEGIN NOW Saint Withold footed thrice the 'old; He met the nightmare, and her nine fold; Bid her alight And her troth plight, And aroint thee, witch, aroint thee! END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW How fares your Grace? END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW What's he? END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Who's there? END
BEGIN NOW What is't you seek? END
BEGIN NOW What are you there? END
BEGIN NOW Your names? END
BEGIN NOW Poor Tom, that eats the swimming frog, the toad, the todpole, the wall-newt and the water; that in the fury of his heart, when the foul fiend rages, eats cow-dung for sallets, swallows the old rat and the ditch-dog, drinks the green mantle of the standing pool; who is whipp'd from tithing to tithing, and stock-punish'd and imprison'd; who hath had three suits to his back, six shirts to his body, horse to ride, and weapons to wear; But mice and rats, and such small deer, Have been Tom's food for seven long year. END
BEGIN NOW Beware my follower. END
BEGIN NOW Peace, Smulkin! END
BEGIN NOW peace, thou fiend! END
BEGIN NOW What, hath your Grace no better company? END
BEGIN NOW The prince of darkness is a gentleman! END
BEGIN NOW Modo he's call'd, and Mahu. END
BEGIN NOW Our flesh and blood is grown so vile, my lord, That it doth hate what gets it. END
BEGIN NOW Poor Tom 's acold. END
BEGIN NOW Go in with me. END
BEGIN NOW My duty cannot suffer T' obey in all your daughters' hard commands. END
BEGIN NOW Though their injunction be to bar my doors And let this tyrannous night take hold upon you, Yet have I ventur'd to come seek you out And bring you where both fire and food is ready. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW First let me talk with this philosopher. END
BEGIN NOW What is the cause of thunder? END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Good my lord, take his offer; go into th' house. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW I'll talk a word with this same learned Theban. END
BEGIN NOW What is your study? END
BEGIN NOW How to prevent the fiend and to kill vermin. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Let me ask you one word in private. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Importune him once more to go, my lord. END
BEGIN NOW His wits begin t' unsettle. END
BEGIN NOW Canst thou blame him? END
BEGIN NOW Storm still. END
BEGIN NOW His daughters seek his death. END
BEGIN NOW Ah, that good Kent! END
BEGIN NOW He said it would be thus- poor banish'd man! END
BEGIN NOW Thou say'st the King grows mad: I'll tell thee, friend, I am almost mad myself. END
BEGIN NOW I had a son, Now outlaw'd from my blood. END
BEGIN NOW He sought my life But lately, very late. END
BEGIN NOW I lov'd him, friend- No father his son dearer. END
BEGIN NOW True to tell thee, The grief hath craz'd my wits. END
BEGIN NOW What a night 's this! END
BEGIN NOW I do beseech your Grace- Lear. END
BEGIN NOW O, cry you mercy, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Noble philosopher, your company. END
BEGIN NOW Tom's acold. END
BEGIN NOW In, fellow, there, into th' hovel; keep thee warm. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Come, let's in all. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW This way, my lord. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW With him! END
BEGIN NOW I will keep still with my philosopher. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Good my lord, soothe him; let him take the fellow. END
BEGIN NOW Take him you on. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Sirrah, come on; go along with us. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Come, good Athenian. END
BEGIN NOW No words, no words! END
BEGIN NOW hush. END
BEGIN NOW Child Rowland to the dark tower came; His word was still Fie, foh, and fum! END
BEGIN NOW I smell the blood of a British man. END
BEGIN NOW Scene V. Gloucester's Castle. END
BEGIN NOW Enter Cornwall and Edmund. END
BEGIN NOW I will have my revenge ere I depart his house. END
BEGIN NOW How, my lord, I may be censured, that nature thus gives way to loyalty, something fears me to think of. END
BEGIN NOW I now perceive it was not altogether your brother's evil disposition made him seek his death; but a provoking merit, set awork by a reproveable badness in himself. END
BEGIN NOW How malicious is my fortune that I must repent to be just! END
BEGIN NOW This is the letter he spoke of, which approves him an intelligent party to the advantages of France. END
BEGIN NOW O heavens! END
BEGIN NOW that this treason were not- or not I the detector! END
BEGIN NOW Go with me to the Duchess. END
BEGIN NOW If the matter of this paper be certain, you have mighty business in hand. END
BEGIN NOW True or false, it hath made thee Earl of Gloucester. END
BEGIN NOW Seek out where thy father is, that he may be ready for our apprehension. END
BEGIN NOW If I find him comforting the King, it will stuff his suspicion more fully.- I will persever in my course of loyalty, though the conflict be sore between that and my blood. END
BEGIN NOW I will lay trust upon thee, and thou shalt find a dearer father in my love. END
BEGIN NOW Scene VI. END
BEGIN NOW A farmhouse near Gloucester's Castle. END
BEGIN NOW Enter Gloucester, Lear, Kent, Fool, and Edgar. END
BEGIN NOW Here is better than the open air; take it thankfully. END
BEGIN NOW I will piece out the comfort with what addition I can. END
BEGIN NOW I will not be long from you. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW All the power of his wits have given way to his impatience. END
BEGIN NOW The gods reward your kindness! END
BEGIN NOW Exit Frateretto calls me, and tells me Nero is an angler in the lake of darkness. END
BEGIN NOW Pray, innocent, and beware the foul fiend. END
BEGIN NOW Fool. END
BEGIN NOW Prithee, nuncle, tell me whether a madman be a gentleman or a yeoman. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW A king, a king! END
BEGIN NOW Fool. END
BEGIN NOW No, he's a yeoman that has a gentleman to his son; for he's a mad yeoman that sees his son a gentleman before him. END

BEGIN NOW To have a thousand with red burning spits Come hizzing in upon 'em- The foul fiend bites my back. END
BEGIN NOW Fool. END
BEGIN NOW He's mad that trusts in the tameness of a wolf, a horse's health, a boy's love, or a whore's oath. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW It shall be done; I will arraign them straight. END
BEGIN NOW Thou, sapient sir, sit here. END
BEGIN NOW Now, you she-foxes! END

BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW How do you, sir? END
BEGIN NOW Stand you not so amaz'd. END
BEGIN NOW Will you lie down and rest upon the cushions? END

BEGIN NOW Here, sir; but trouble him not; his wits are gone. END
BEGIN NOW Good friend, I prithee take him in thy arms. END
BEGIN NOW I have o'erheard a plot of death upon him. END
BEGIN NOW There is a litter ready; lay him in't And drive towards Dover, friend, where thou shalt meet Both welcome and protection. END

BEGIN NOW Come, come, away! END
BEGIN NOW Exeunt When we our betters see bearing our woes, We scarcely think our miseries our foes. END
BEGIN NOW Who alone suffers suffers most i' th' mind, Leaving free things and happy shows behind; But then the mind much sufferance doth o'erskip When grief hath mates, and bearing fellowship. END

BEGIN NOW Tom, away! END
BEGIN NOW Mark the high noises, and thyself bewray When false opinion, whose wrong thought defiles thee, In thy just proof repeals and reconciles thee. END

BEGIN NOW Pluck out his eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Leave him to my displeasure. END
BEGIN NOW Edmund, keep you our sister company. END
BEGIN NOW The revenges we are bound to take upon your traitorous father are not fit for your beholding. END
BEGIN NOW Advise the Duke where you are going, to a most festinate preparation. END
BEGIN NOW We are bound to the like. END
BEGIN NOW Our posts shall be swift and intelligent betwixt us. END
BEGIN NOW Farewell, dear sister; farewell, my Lord of Gloucester. END
BEGIN NOW Enter Steward. END
BEGIN NOW How now? END
BEGIN NOW Where's the King? END
BEGIN NOW My Lord of Gloucester hath convey'd him hence. END
BEGIN NOW Some five or six and thirty of his knights, Hot questrists after him, met him at gate; Who, with some other of the lord's dependants, Are gone with him towards Dover, where they boast To have well-armed friends. END
BEGIN NOW Get horses for your mistress. END
BEGIN NOW Farewell, sweet lord, and sister. END
BEGIN NOW Edmund, farewell. END
BEGIN NOW Exeunt Go seek the traitor Gloucester, Pinion him like a thief, bring him before us. END
BEGIN NOW Though well we may not pass upon his life Without the form of justice, yet our power Shall do a court'sy to our wrath, which men May blame, but not control. END
BEGIN NOW Enter Gloucester, brought in by two or three. END
BEGIN NOW Who's there? END
BEGIN NOW the traitor? END
BEGIN NOW Ingrateful fox! END
BEGIN NOW 'tis he. END
BEGIN NOW Bind fast his corky arms. END
BEGIN NOW What mean, your Graces? END
BEGIN NOW Good my friends, consider You are my guests. END
BEGIN NOW Do me no foul play, friends. END

BEGIN NOW Hard, hard. END
BEGIN NOW O filthy traitor! END
BEGIN NOW Unmerciful lady as you are, I am none. END
BEGIN NOW To this chair bind him. END
BEGIN NOW Villain, thou shalt find- By the kind gods, 'tis most ignobly done To pluck me by the beard. END
BEGIN NOW So white, and such a traitor! END
BEGIN NOW Naughty lady, These hairs which thou dost ravish from my chin Will quicken, and accuse thee. END
BEGIN NOW I am your host. END
BEGIN NOW With robber's hands my hospitable favours You should not ruffle thus. END
BEGIN NOW What will you do? END
BEGIN NOW Come, sir, what letters had you late from France? END
BEGIN NOW Be simple-answer'd, for we know the truth. END
BEGIN NOW And what confederacy have you with the traitors Late footed in the kingdom? END
BEGIN NOW To whose hands have you sent the lunatic King? END
BEGIN NOW Speak. END
BEGIN NOW I have a letter guessingly set down, Which came from one that's of a neutral heart, And not from one oppos'd. END
BEGIN NOW Cunning. END
BEGIN NOW And false. END
BEGIN NOW Where hast thou sent the King? END
BEGIN NOW To Dover. END
BEGIN NOW Wherefore to Dover? END
BEGIN NOW Wast thou not charg'd at peril- Wherefore to Dover? END
BEGIN NOW Let him first answer that. END
BEGIN NOW I am tied to th' stake, and I must stand the course. END
BEGIN NOW Wherefore to Dover, sir? END
BEGIN NOW Because I would not see thy cruel nails Pluck out his poor old eyes; nor thy fierce sister In his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs. END
BEGIN NOW The sea, with such a storm as his bare head In hell-black night endur'd, would have buoy'd up And quench'd the steeled fires. END
BEGIN NOW Yet, poor old heart, he holp the heavens to rain. END
BEGIN NOW If wolves had at thy gate howl'd that stern time, Thou shouldst have said, 'Good porter, turn the key.' END
BEGIN NOW All cruels else subscrib'd. END
BEGIN NOW But I shall see The winged vengeance overtake such children. END
BEGIN NOW See't shalt thou never. END
BEGIN NOW Fellows, hold the chair. END
BEGIN NOW Upon these eyes of thine I'll set my foot. END
BEGIN NOW He that will think to live till he be old, Give me some help!- O cruel! END
BEGIN NOW O ye gods! END
BEGIN NOW One side will mock another. END
BEGIN NOW Th' other too! END
BEGIN NOW If you see vengeance- Hold your hand, my lord! END
BEGIN NOW I have serv'd you ever since I was a child; But better service have I never done you Than now to bid you hold. END
BEGIN NOW How now, you dog? END
BEGIN NOW If you did wear a beard upon your chin, I'ld shake it on this quarrel. END
BEGIN NOW What do you mean? END
BEGIN NOW My villain! END
BEGIN NOW Draw and fight. END
BEGIN NOW Nay, then, come on, and take the chance of anger. END
BEGIN NOW Give me thy sword. END
BEGIN NOW A peasant stand up thus? END
BEGIN NOW She takes a sword and runs at him behind. END
BEGIN NOW O, I am slain! END
BEGIN NOW My lord, you have one eye left To see some mischief on him. END
BEGIN NOW O! END
BEGIN NOW He dies. END
BEGIN NOW Lest it see more, prevent it. END
BEGIN NOW Out, vile jelly! END
BEGIN NOW Where is thy lustre now? END
BEGIN NOW All dark and comfortless! END
BEGIN NOW Where's my son Edmund? END
BEGIN NOW Edmund, enkindle all the sparks of nature To quit this horrid act. END
BEGIN NOW Out, treacherous villain! END
BEGIN NOW Thou call'st on him that hates thee. END
BEGIN NOW It was he That made the overture of thy treasons to us; Who is too good to pity thee. END
BEGIN NOW O my follies! END
BEGIN NOW Then Edgar was abus'd. END
BEGIN NOW Kind gods, forgive me that, and prosper him! END
BEGIN NOW Go thrust him out at gates, and let him smell His way to Dover. END
BEGIN NOW Exit with Gloucester. END
BEGIN NOW How is't, my lord? END
BEGIN NOW How look you? END
BEGIN NOW I have receiv'd a hurt. END
BEGIN NOW Follow me, lady. END
BEGIN NOW Turn out that eyeless villain. END
BEGIN NOW Throw this slave Upon the dunghill. END
BEGIN NOW Regan, I bleed apace. END
BEGIN NOW Untimely comes this hurt. END
BEGIN NOW Give me your arm. END
BEGIN NOW Exit I'll never care what wickedness I do, If this man come to good. END
BEGIN NOW If she live long, And in the end meet the old course of death, Women will all turn monsters. END
BEGIN NOW Let's follow the old Earl, and get the bedlam To lead him where he would. END
BEGIN NOW His roguish madness Allows itself to anything. END
BEGIN NOW Go thou. END
BEGIN NOW I'll fetch some flax and whites of eggs To apply to his bleeding face. END
BEGIN NOW Now heaven help him! END
BEGIN NOW ACT IV. END
BEGIN NOW Scene I. END
BEGIN NOW The heath. END
BEGIN NOW Enter Edgar. END
BEGIN NOW Yet better thus, and known to be contemn'd, Than still contemn'd and flatter'd. END
BEGIN NOW To be worst, The lowest and most dejected thing of fortune, Stands still in esperance, lives not in fear. END
BEGIN NOW The lamentable change is from the best; The worst returns to laughter. END
BEGIN NOW Welcome then, Thou unsubstantial air that I embrace! END
BEGIN NOW The wretch that thou hast blown unto the worst Owes nothing to thy blasts. END
BEGIN NOW Enter Gloucester, led by an Old Man. END
BEGIN NOW But who comes here? END
BEGIN NOW My father, poorly led? END
BEGIN NOW World, world, O world! END
BEGIN NOW But that thy strange mutations make us hate thee, Life would not yield to age. END
BEGIN NOW Old Man. END
BEGIN NOW O my good lord, I have been your tenant, and your father's tenant, These fourscore years. END
BEGIN NOW Away, get thee away! END
BEGIN NOW Good friend, be gone. END
BEGIN NOW Thy comforts can do me no good at all; Thee they may hurt. END
BEGIN NOW Old Man. END
BEGIN NOW You cannot see your way. END
BEGIN NOW I have no way, and therefore want no eyes; I stumbled when I saw. END
BEGIN NOW Full oft 'tis seen Our means secure us, and our mere defects Prove our commodities. END
BEGIN NOW Ah dear son Edgar, The food of thy abused father's wrath! END
BEGIN NOW Might I but live to see thee in my touch, I'ld say I had eyes again! END
BEGIN NOW Old Man. END
BEGIN NOW How now? END
BEGIN NOW Who's there? END
BEGIN NOW O gods! END
BEGIN NOW Who is't can say 'I am at the worst'? END
BEGIN NOW I am worse than e'er I was. END
BEGIN NOW Old Man. END
BEGIN NOW 'Tis poor mad Tom. END
BEGIN NOW And worse I may be yet. END
BEGIN NOW The worst is not So long as we can say 'This is the worst.' END
BEGIN NOW Old Man. END
BEGIN NOW Fellow, where goest? END
BEGIN NOW Is it a beggarman? END
BEGIN NOW Old Man. END
BEGIN NOW Madman and beggar too. END
BEGIN NOW He has some reason, else he could not beg. END
BEGIN NOW I' th' last night's storm I such a fellow saw, Which made me think a man a worm. END
BEGIN NOW My son Came then into my mind, and yet my mind Was then scarce friends with him. END
BEGIN NOW I have heard more since. END
BEGIN NOW As flies to wanton boys are we to th' gods. END
BEGIN NOW They kill us for their sport. END
BEGIN NOW How should this be? END
BEGIN NOW Bad is the trade that must play fool to sorrow, Ang'ring itself and others.- Bless thee, master! END
BEGIN NOW Is that the naked fellow? END
BEGIN NOW Old Man. END
BEGIN NOW Ay, my lord. END
BEGIN NOW Then prithee get thee gone. END
BEGIN NOW If for my sake Thou wilt o'ertake us hence a mile or twain I' th' way toward Dover, do it for ancient love; And bring some covering for this naked soul, Who I'll entreat to lead me. END
BEGIN NOW Old Man. END
BEGIN NOW Alack, sir, he is mad! END
BEGIN NOW 'Tis the time's plague when madmen lead the blind. END
BEGIN NOW Do as I bid thee, or rather do thy pleasure. END
BEGIN NOW Above the rest, be gone. END
BEGIN NOW Old Man. END
BEGIN NOW I'll bring him the best 'parel that I have, Come on't what will. END
BEGIN NOW Exit. END
BEGIN NOW Sirrah naked fellow- Poor Tom's acold. END
BEGIN NOW I cannot daub it further. END
BEGIN NOW Come hither, fellow. END
BEGIN NOW And yet I must.- Bless thy sweet eyes, they bleed. END
BEGIN NOW Know'st thou the way to Dover? END
BEGIN NOW Both stile and gate, horseway and footpath. END
BEGIN NOW Poor Tom hath been scar'd out of his good wits. END
BEGIN NOW Bless thee, good man's son, from the foul fiend! END
BEGIN NOW Five fiends have been in poor Tom at once: of lust, as Obidicut; Hobbididence, prince of dumbness; Mahu, of stealing; Modo, of murder; Flibbertigibbet, of mopping and mowing, who since possesses chambermaids and waiting women. END
BEGIN NOW So, bless thee, master! END
BEGIN NOW Here, take this Purse, thou whom the heavens' plagues Have humbled to all strokes. END
BEGIN NOW That I am wretched Makes thee the happier. END
BEGIN NOW Heavens, deal so still! END
BEGIN NOW Let the superfluous and lust-dieted man, That slaves your ordinance, that will not see Because he does not feel, feel your pow'r quickly; So distribution should undo excess, And each man have enough. END
BEGIN NOW Dost thou know Dover? END
BEGIN NOW Ay, master. END
BEGIN NOW There is a cliff, whose high and bending head Looks fearfully in the confined deep. END
BEGIN NOW Bring me but to the very brim of it, And I'll repair the misery thou dost bear With something rich about me. END
BEGIN NOW From that place I shall no leading need. END
BEGIN NOW Give me thy arm. END
BEGIN NOW Poor Tom shall lead thee. END
BEGIN NOW Scene II. END
BEGIN NOW Before the Duke of Albany's Palace. END
BEGIN NOW Enter Welcome, my lord. END
BEGIN NOW I marvel our mild husband Not met us on the way. END
BEGIN NOW Enter Steward. END
BEGIN NOW Now, where's your master? END
BEGIN NOW Madam, within, but never man so chang'd. END
BEGIN NOW I told him of the army that was landed: He smil'd at it. END
BEGIN NOW I told him you were coming: His answer was, 'The worse.' END
BEGIN NOW Of Gloucester's treachery And of the loyal service of his son When I inform'd him, then he call'd me sot And told me I had turn'd the wrong side out. END
BEGIN NOW What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him; What like, offensive. END
BEGIN NOW Then shall you go no further. END
BEGIN NOW It is the cowish terror of his spirit, That dares not undertake. END
BEGIN NOW He'll not feel wrongs Which tie him to an answer. END
BEGIN NOW Our wishes on the way May prove effects. END
BEGIN NOW Back, Edmund, to my brother. END
BEGIN NOW Hasten his musters and conduct his pow'rs. END
BEGIN NOW I must change arms at home and give the distaff Into my husband's hands. END
BEGIN NOW This trusty servant Shall pass between us. END
BEGIN NOW Ere long you are like to hear (If you dare venture in your own behalf) A mistress's command. END
BEGIN NOW Wear this. END
BEGIN NOW Spare speech. END
BEGIN NOW Decline your head. END
BEGIN NOW This kiss, if it durst speak, Would stretch thy spirits up into the air. END
BEGIN NOW Conceive, and fare thee well. END
BEGIN NOW Yours in the ranks of death! END
BEGIN NOW Exit. END
BEGIN NOW My most dear Gloucester! END
BEGIN NOW O, the difference of man and man! END
BEGIN NOW To thee a woman's services are due; My fool usurps my body. END
BEGIN NOW Madam, here comes my lord. END
BEGIN NOW Exit. END
BEGIN NOW Enter Albany. END
BEGIN NOW I have been worth the whistle. END
BEGIN NOW O Goneril, You are not worth the dust which the rude wind Blows in your face! END
BEGIN NOW I fear your disposition. END
BEGIN NOW That nature which contemns it origin Cannot be bordered certain in itself. END
BEGIN NOW She that herself will sliver and disbranch From her material sap, perforce must wither And come to deadly use. END
BEGIN NOW No more! END
BEGIN NOW The text is foolish. END
BEGIN NOW Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile; Filths savour but themselves. END
BEGIN NOW What have you done? END
BEGIN NOW Tigers, not daughters, what have you perform'd? END
BEGIN NOW A father, and a gracious aged man, Whose reverence even the head-lugg'd bear would lick, Most barbarous, most degenerate, have you madded. END
BEGIN NOW Could my good brother suffer you to do it? END
BEGIN NOW A man, a prince, by him so benefited! END
BEGIN NOW If that the heavens do not their visible spirits Send quickly down to tame these vile offences, It will come, Humanity must perforce prey on itself, Like monsters of the deep. END
BEGIN NOW Milk-liver'd man! END
BEGIN NOW That bear'st a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs; Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning Thine honour from thy suffering; that not know'st Fools do those villains pity who are punish'd Ere they have done their mischief. END
BEGIN NOW Where's thy drum? END
BEGIN NOW France spreads his banners in our noiseless land, With plumed helm thy state begins to threat, Whiles thou, a moral fool, sit'st still, and criest 'Alack, why does he so?' END
BEGIN NOW See thyself, devil! END
BEGIN NOW Proper deformity seems not in the fiend So horrid as in woman. END
BEGIN NOW O vain fool! END
BEGIN NOW Thou changed and self-cover'd thing, for shame! END
BEGIN NOW Bemonster not thy feature! END
BEGIN NOW Were't my fitness To let these hands obey my blood, They are apt enough to dislocate and tear Thy flesh and bones. END
BEGIN NOW Howe'er thou art a fiend, A woman's shape doth shield thee. END
BEGIN NOW Marry, your manhood mew! END
BEGIN NOW Enter a Gentleman. END
BEGIN NOW What news? END
BEGIN NOW O, my good lord, the Duke of Cornwall 's dead, Slain by his servant, going to put out The other eye of Gloucester. END
BEGIN NOW Gloucester's eyes? END
BEGIN NOW A servant that he bred, thrill'd with remorse, Oppos'd against the act, bending his sword To his great master; who, thereat enrag'd, Flew on him, and amongst them fell'd him dead; But not without that harmful stroke which since Hath pluck'd him after. END
BEGIN NOW This shows you are above, You justicers, that these our nether crimes So speedily can venge! END
BEGIN NOW But O poor Gloucester! END
BEGIN NOW Lose he his other eye? END
BEGIN NOW Both, both, my lord. END
BEGIN NOW This letter, madam, craves a speedy answer. END
BEGIN NOW 'Tis from your sister. END
BEGIN NOW One way I like this well; But being widow, and my Gloucester with her, May all the building in my fancy pluck Upon my hateful life. END
BEGIN NOW Another way The news is not so tart.- I'll read, and answer. END
BEGIN NOW Exit. END
BEGIN NOW Where was his son when they did take his eyes? END
BEGIN NOW Come with my lady hither. END
BEGIN NOW He is not here. END
BEGIN NOW No, my good lord; I met him back again. END
BEGIN NOW Knows he the wickedness? END
BEGIN NOW Ay, my good lord. END
BEGIN NOW 'Twas he inform'd against him, And quit the house on purpose, that their punishment Might have the freer course. END
BEGIN NOW Gloucester, I live To thank thee for the love thou show'dst the King, And to revenge thine eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Come hither, friend. END
BEGIN NOW Tell me what more thou know'st. END
BEGIN NOW Scene III. END
BEGIN NOW The French camp near Dover. END
BEGIN NOW Enter Kent and a Gentleman. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back know you the reason? END
BEGIN NOW Something he left imperfect in the state, which since his coming forth is thought of, which imports to the kingdom so much fear and danger that his personal return was most required and necessary. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Who hath he left behind him general? END
BEGIN NOW The Marshal of France, Monsieur La Far. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Did your letters pierce the Queen to any demonstration of grief? END
BEGIN NOW Ay, sir. END
BEGIN NOW She took them, read them in my presence, And now and then an ample tear trill'd down Her delicate cheek. END
BEGIN NOW It seem'd she was a queen Over her passion, who, most rebel-like, Sought to be king o'er her. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW O, then it mov'd her? END
BEGIN NOW Not to a rage. END
BEGIN NOW Patience and sorrow strove Who should express her goodliest. END
BEGIN NOW You have seen Sunshine and rain at once: her smiles and tears Were like, a better way. END
BEGIN NOW Those happy smilets That play'd on her ripe lip seem'd not to know What guests were in her eyes, which parted thence As pearls from diamonds dropp'd. END
BEGIN NOW In brief, Sorrow would be a rarity most belov'd, If all could so become it. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Made she no verbal question? END
BEGIN NOW Faith, once or twice she heav'd the name of father Pantingly forth, as if it press'd her heart; Cried 'Sisters, sisters! END
BEGIN NOW Shame of ladies! END
BEGIN NOW Sisters! END
BEGIN NOW Kent! END
BEGIN NOW father! END
BEGIN NOW sisters! END
BEGIN NOW What, i' th' storm? END
BEGIN NOW i' th' night? END
BEGIN NOW Let pity not be believ'd!' END
BEGIN NOW There she shook The holy water from her heavenly eyes, And clamour moisten'd. END
BEGIN NOW Then away she started To deal with grief alone. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW It is the stars, The stars above us, govern our conditions; Else one self mate and mate could not beget Such different issues. END
BEGIN NOW You spoke not with her since? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Was this before the King return'd? END
BEGIN NOW No, since. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Well, sir, the poor distressed Lear's i' th' town; Who sometime, in his better tune, remembers What we are come about, and by no means Will yield to see his daughter. END
BEGIN NOW Why, good sir? END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW A sovereign shame so elbows him; his own unkindness, That stripp'd her from his benediction, turn'd her To foreign casualties, gave her dear rights To his dog-hearted daughters- these things sting His mind so venomously that burning shame Detains him from Cordelia. END
BEGIN NOW Alack, poor gentleman! END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Of Albany's and Cornwall's powers you heard not? END
BEGIN NOW 'Tis so; they are afoot. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Well, sir, I'll bring you to our master Lear And leave you to attend him. END
BEGIN NOW Some dear cause Will in concealment wrap me up awhile. END
BEGIN NOW When I am known aright, you shall not grieve Lending me this acquaintance. END
BEGIN NOW I pray you go Along with me. END
BEGIN NOW Scene IV. END
BEGIN NOW The French camp. END
BEGIN NOW Enter, with Drum and Colours, Cordelia, Doctor, and Soldiers. END
BEGIN NOW Alack, 'tis he! END
BEGIN NOW Why, he was met even now As mad as the vex'd sea, singing aloud, Crown'd with rank fumiter and furrow weeds, With hardocks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo flow'rs, Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow In our sustaining corn. END
BEGIN NOW A century send forth. END
BEGIN NOW Search every acre in the high-grown field And bring him to our eye. END
BEGIN NOW What can man's wisdom In the restoring his bereaved sense? END
BEGIN NOW He that helps him take all my outward worth. END
BEGIN NOW There is means, madam. END
BEGIN NOW Our foster nurse of nature is repose, The which he lacks. END
BEGIN NOW That to provoke in him Are many simples operative, whose power Will close the eye of anguish. END
BEGIN NOW All blest secrets, All you unpublish'd virtues of the earth, Spring with my tears! END
BEGIN NOW be aidant and remediate In the good man's distress! END
BEGIN NOW Seek, seek for him! END
BEGIN NOW Lest his ungovern'd rage dissolve the life That wants the means to lead it. END
BEGIN NOW Enter Messenger. END
BEGIN NOW Mess. END
BEGIN NOW News, madam. END
BEGIN NOW The British pow'rs are marching hitherward. END
BEGIN NOW 'Tis known before. END
BEGIN NOW Our preparation stands In expectation of them. END
BEGIN NOW O dear father, It is thy business that I go about. END
BEGIN NOW Therefore great France My mourning and important tears hath pitied. END
BEGIN NOW No blown ambition doth our arms incite, But love, dear love, and our ag'd father's right. END
BEGIN NOW Soon may I hear and see him! END
BEGIN NOW Scene V. Gloucester's Castle. END
BEGIN NOW Enter Regan and Steward. END
BEGIN NOW But are my brother's pow'rs set forth? END
BEGIN NOW Ay, madam. END
BEGIN NOW Himself in person there? END
BEGIN NOW Madam, with much ado. END
BEGIN NOW Your sister is the better soldier. END
BEGIN NOW Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home? END
BEGIN NOW No, madam. END
BEGIN NOW What might import my sister's letter to him? END
BEGIN NOW I know not, lady. END
BEGIN NOW Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter. END
BEGIN NOW It was great ignorance, Gloucester's eyes being out, To let him live. END
BEGIN NOW Where he arrives he moves All hearts against us. END
BEGIN NOW Edmund, I think, is gone, In pity of his misery, to dispatch His nighted life; moreover, to descry The strength o' th' enemy. END
BEGIN NOW I must needs after him, madam, with my letter. END
BEGIN NOW Our troops set forth to-morrow. END
BEGIN NOW Stay with us. END
BEGIN NOW The ways are dangerous. END
BEGIN NOW I may not, madam. END
BEGIN NOW My lady charg'd my duty in this business. END
BEGIN NOW Why should she write to Edmund? END
BEGIN NOW Might not you Transport her purposes by word? END
BEGIN NOW Belike, Something- I know not what- I'll love thee much- Let me unseal the letter. END
BEGIN NOW Madam, I had rather- I know your lady does not love her husband; I am sure of that; and at her late being here She gave strange eliads and most speaking looks To noble Edmund. END
BEGIN NOW I know you are of her bosom. END
BEGIN NOW I, madam? END
BEGIN NOW I speak in understanding. END
BEGIN NOW Y'are! END
BEGIN NOW I know't. END
BEGIN NOW Therefore I do advise you take this note. END
BEGIN NOW My lord is dead; Edmund and I have talk'd, And more convenient is he for my hand Than for your lady's. END
BEGIN NOW You may gather more. END
BEGIN NOW If you do find him, pray you give him this; And when your mistress hears thus much from you, I pray desire her call her wisdom to her. END
BEGIN NOW So farewell. END
BEGIN NOW If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor, Preferment falls on him that cuts him off. END
BEGIN NOW Would I could meet him, madam! END
BEGIN NOW I should show What party I do follow. END
BEGIN NOW Fare thee well. END
BEGIN NOW Scene VI. END
BEGIN NOW The country near Dover. END
BEGIN NOW Enter Gloucester, and Edgar When shall I come to th' top of that same hill? END
BEGIN NOW You do climb up it now. END
BEGIN NOW Look how we labour. END
BEGIN NOW Methinks the ground is even. END
BEGIN NOW Horrible steep. END
BEGIN NOW Hark, do you hear the sea? END
BEGIN NOW No, truly. END
BEGIN NOW Why, then, your other senses grow imperfect By your eyes' anguish. END
BEGIN NOW So may it be indeed. END
BEGIN NOW Methinks thy voice is alter'd, and thou speak'st In better phrase and matter than thou didst. END
BEGIN NOW Y'are much deceiv'd. END
BEGIN NOW In nothing am I chang'd But in my garments. END
BEGIN NOW Methinks y'are better spoken. END
BEGIN NOW Come on, sir; here's the place. END
BEGIN NOW Stand still. END
BEGIN NOW How fearful And dizzy 'tis to cast one's eyes so low! END
BEGIN NOW The crows and choughs that wing the midway air Show scarce so gross as beetles. END
BEGIN NOW Halfway down Hangs one that gathers sampire- dreadful trade! END
BEGIN NOW Methinks he seems no bigger than his head. END
BEGIN NOW The fishermen that walk upon the beach Appear like mice; and yond tall anchoring bark, Diminish'd to her cock; her cock, a buoy Almost too small for sight. END
BEGIN NOW The murmuring surge That on th' unnumb'red idle pebble chafes Cannot be heard so high. END
BEGIN NOW I'll look no more, Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight Topple down headlong. END
BEGIN NOW Set me where you stand. END
BEGIN NOW Give me your hand. END
BEGIN NOW You are now within a foot Of th' extreme verge. END
BEGIN NOW For all beneath the moon Would I not leap upright. END
BEGIN NOW Let go my hand. END
BEGIN NOW Here, friend, is another purse; in it a jewel Well worth a poor man's taking. END
BEGIN NOW Fairies and gods Prosper it with thee! END
BEGIN NOW Go thou further off; Bid me farewell, and let me hear thee going. END
BEGIN NOW Now fare ye well, good sir. END
BEGIN NOW With all my heart. END
BEGIN NOW Why I do trifle thus with his despair Is done to cure it. END
BEGIN NOW O you mighty gods! END
BEGIN NOW He kneels. END
BEGIN NOW This world I do renounce, and, in your sights, Shake patiently my great affliction off. END
BEGIN NOW If I could bear it longer and not fall To quarrel with your great opposeless wills, My snuff and loathed part of nature should Burn itself out. END
BEGIN NOW If Edgar live, O, bless him! END
BEGIN NOW Now, fellow, fare thee well. END
BEGIN NOW He falls Gone, sir, farewell.- And yet I know not how conceit may rob The treasury of life when life itself Yields to the theft. END
BEGIN NOW Had he been where he thought, By this had thought been past.- Alive or dead? END
BEGIN NOW Ho you, sir! END
BEGIN NOW friend! END
BEGIN NOW Hear you, sir? END
BEGIN NOW Speak!- Thus might he pass indeed. END
BEGIN NOW Yet he revives. END
BEGIN NOW What are you, sir? END
BEGIN NOW Away, and let me die. END
BEGIN NOW Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air, So many fadom down precipitating, Thou'dst shiver'd like an egg; but thou dost breathe; Hast heavy substance; bleed'st not; speak'st; art sound. END
BEGIN NOW Ten masts at each make not the altitude Which thou hast perpendicularly fell. END
BEGIN NOW Thy life is a miracle. END
BEGIN NOW Speak yet again. END
BEGIN NOW But have I fall'n, or no? END
BEGIN NOW From the dread summit of this chalky bourn. END
BEGIN NOW Look up a-height. END
BEGIN NOW The shrill-gorg'd lark so far Cannot be seen or heard. END
BEGIN NOW Do but look up. END
BEGIN NOW Alack, I have no eyes! END
BEGIN NOW Is wretchedness depriv'd that benefit To end itself by death? END
BEGIN NOW 'Twas yet some comfort When misery could beguile the tyrant's rage And frustrate his proud will. END
BEGIN NOW Give me your arm. END
BEGIN NOW Up- so. END
BEGIN NOW How is't? END
BEGIN NOW Feel you your legs? END
BEGIN NOW You stand. END
BEGIN NOW Too well, too well. END
BEGIN NOW This is above all strangeness. END
BEGIN NOW Upon the crown o' th' cliff what thing was that Which parted from you? END
BEGIN NOW A poor unfortunate beggar. END
BEGIN NOW As I stood here below, methought his eyes Were two full moons; he had a thousand noses, Horns whelk'd and wav'd like the enridged sea. END
BEGIN NOW It was some fiend. END
BEGIN NOW Therefore, thou happy father, Think that the clearest gods, who make them honours Of men's impossibility, have preserv'd thee. END
BEGIN NOW I do remember now. END
BEGIN NOW Henceforth I'll bear Affliction till it do cry out itself 'Enough, enough,' and die. END
BEGIN NOW That thing you speak of, I took it for a man. END
BEGIN NOW Often 'twould say 'The fiend, the fiend'- he led me to that place. END
BEGIN NOW Bear free and patient thoughts. END
BEGIN NOW Enter Lear, mad, But who comes here? END
BEGIN NOW The safer sense will ne'er accommodate His master thus. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW No, they cannot touch me for coming; I am the King himself. END
BEGIN NOW O thou side-piercing sight! END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Nature 's above art in that respect. END
BEGIN NOW There's your press money. END
BEGIN NOW That fellow handles his bow like a crow-keeper. END
BEGIN NOW Draw me a clothier's yard. END
BEGIN NOW Look, look, a mouse! END
BEGIN NOW Peace, peace; this piece of toasted cheese will do't. END
BEGIN NOW There's my gauntlet; I'll prove it on a giant. END
BEGIN NOW Bring up the brown bills. END
BEGIN NOW O, well flown, bird! END
BEGIN NOW i' th' clout, i' th' clout! END
BEGIN NOW Hewgh! END
BEGIN NOW Give the word. END
BEGIN NOW Sweet marjoram. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Pass. END
BEGIN NOW I know that voice. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Ha! END
BEGIN NOW Goneril with a white beard? END
BEGIN NOW They flatter'd me like a dog, and told me I had white hairs in my beard ere the black ones were there. END
BEGIN NOW To say 'ay' and 'no' to everything I said! END
BEGIN NOW 'Ay' and 'no' too was no good divinity. END
BEGIN NOW When the rain came to wet me once, and the wind to make me chatter; when the thunder would not peace at my bidding; there I found 'em, there I smelt 'em out. END
BEGIN NOW Go to, they are not men o' their words! END
BEGIN NOW They told me I was everything. END
BEGIN NOW 'Tis a lie- I am not ague-proof. END
BEGIN NOW The trick of that voice I do well remember. END
BEGIN NOW Is't not the King? END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Ay, every inch a king! END
BEGIN NOW When I do stare, see how the subject quakes. END
BEGIN NOW I pardon that man's life. END
BEGIN NOW What was thy cause? END
BEGIN NOW Adultery? END
BEGIN NOW Thou shalt not die. END
BEGIN NOW Die for adultery? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW The wren goes to't, and the small gilded fly Does lecher in my sight. END
BEGIN NOW Let copulation thrive; for Gloucester's bastard son Was kinder to his father than my daughters Got 'tween the lawful sheets. END
BEGIN NOW To't, luxury, pell-mell! END
BEGIN NOW for I lack soldiers. END
BEGIN NOW Behold yond simp'ring dame, Whose face between her forks presageth snow, That minces virtue, and does shake the head To hear of pleasure's name. END
BEGIN NOW The fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to't With a more riotous appetite. END
BEGIN NOW Down from the waist they are Centaurs, Though women all above. END
BEGIN NOW But to the girdle do the gods inherit, Beneath is all the fiend's. END
BEGIN NOW There's hell, there's darkness, there's the sulphurous pit; burning, scalding, stench, consumption. END
BEGIN NOW Fie, fie, fie! END
BEGIN NOW pah, pah! END
BEGIN NOW Give me an ounce of civet, good apothecary, to sweeten my imagination. END
BEGIN NOW There's money for thee. END
BEGIN NOW O, let me kiss that hand! END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality. END
BEGIN NOW O ruin'd piece of nature! END
BEGIN NOW This great world Shall so wear out to naught. END
BEGIN NOW Dost thou know me? END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW I remember thine eyes well enough. END
BEGIN NOW Dost thou squiny at me? END
BEGIN NOW No, do thy worst, blind Cupid! END
BEGIN NOW I'll not love. END
BEGIN NOW Read thou this challenge; mark but the penning of it. END
BEGIN NOW Were all the letters suns, I could not see one. END
BEGIN NOW I would not take this from report. END
BEGIN NOW It is, And my heart breaks at it. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Read. END
BEGIN NOW What, with the case of eyes? END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW O, ho, are you there with me? END
BEGIN NOW No eyes in your head, nor no money in your purse? END
BEGIN NOW Your eyes are in a heavy case, your purse in a light. END
BEGIN NOW Yet you see how this world goes. END
BEGIN NOW I see it feelingly. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW What, art mad? END
BEGIN NOW A man may see how the world goes with no eyes. END
BEGIN NOW Look with thine ears. END
BEGIN NOW See how yond justice rails upon yond simple thief. END
BEGIN NOW Hark in thine ear. END
BEGIN NOW Change places and, handy-dandy, which is the justice, which is the thief? END
BEGIN NOW Thou hast seen a farmer's dog bark at a beggar? END
BEGIN NOW Ay, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW And the creature run from the cur? END
BEGIN NOW There thou mightst behold the great image of authority: a dog's obeyed in office. END
BEGIN NOW Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand! END
BEGIN NOW Why dost thou lash that whore? END
BEGIN NOW Strip thine own back. END
BEGIN NOW Thou hotly lusts to use her in that kind For which thou whip'st her. END
BEGIN NOW The usurer hangs the cozener. END
BEGIN NOW Through tatter'd clothes small vices do appear; Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. END
BEGIN NOW Plate sin with gold, And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks; Arm it in rags, a pygmy's straw does pierce it. END
BEGIN NOW None does offend, none- I say none! END
BEGIN NOW I'll able 'em. END
BEGIN NOW Take that of me, my friend, who have the power To seal th' accuser's lips. END
BEGIN NOW Get thee glass eyes And, like a scurvy politician, seem To see the things thou dost not. END
BEGIN NOW Now, now, now, now! END
BEGIN NOW Pull off my boots. END
BEGIN NOW Harder, harder! END
BEGIN NOW So. END
BEGIN NOW O, matter and impertinency mix'd! END
BEGIN NOW Reason, in madness! END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes. END
BEGIN NOW I know thee well enough; thy name is Gloucester. END
BEGIN NOW Thou must be patient. END
BEGIN NOW We came crying hither; Thou know'st, the first time that we smell the air We wawl and cry. END
BEGIN NOW I will preach to thee. END
BEGIN NOW Mark. END
BEGIN NOW Alack, alack the day! END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW When we are born, we cry that we are come To this great stage of fools. END
BEGIN NOW This' a good block. END
BEGIN NOW It were a delicate stratagem to shoe A troop of horse with felt. END
BEGIN NOW I'll put't in proof, And when I have stol'n upon these sons-in-law, Then kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill! END
BEGIN NOW Enter a Gentleman O, here he is! END
BEGIN NOW Lay hand upon him.- Sir, Your most dear daughter- Lear. END
BEGIN NOW No rescue? END
BEGIN NOW What, a prisoner? END
BEGIN NOW I am even The natural fool of fortune. END
BEGIN NOW Use me well; You shall have ransom. END
BEGIN NOW Let me have a surgeon; I am cut to th' brains. END
BEGIN NOW You shall have anything. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW No seconds? END
BEGIN NOW All myself? END
BEGIN NOW Why, this would make a man a man of salt, To use his eyes for garden waterpots, Ay, and laying autumn's dust. END
BEGIN NOW Good sir- Lear. END
BEGIN NOW I will die bravely, like a smug bridegroom. END
BEGIN NOW What! END
BEGIN NOW I will be jovial. END
BEGIN NOW Come, come, I am a king; My masters, know you that? END
BEGIN NOW You are a royal one, and we obey you. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Then there's life in't. END
BEGIN NOW Nay, an you get it, you shall get it by running. END
BEGIN NOW Sa, sa, sa, sa! END
BEGIN NOW Exit running. END
BEGIN NOW A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch, Past speaking of in a king! END
BEGIN NOW Thou hast one daughter Who redeems nature from the general curse Which twain have brought her to. END
BEGIN NOW Hail, gentle sir. END
BEGIN NOW Sir, speed you. END
BEGIN NOW What's your will? END
BEGIN NOW Do you hear aught, sir, of a battle toward? END
BEGIN NOW Most sure and vulgar. END
BEGIN NOW Every one hears that Which can distinguish sound. END
BEGIN NOW But, by your favour, How near's the other army? END
BEGIN NOW Near and on speedy foot. END
BEGIN NOW The main descry Stands on the hourly thought. END
BEGIN NOW I thank you sir. END
BEGIN NOW That's all. END
BEGIN NOW Though that the Queen on special cause is here, Her army is mov'd on. END
BEGIN NOW I thank you, sir Exit You ever-gentle gods, take my breath from me; Let not my worser spirit tempt me again To die before you please! END
BEGIN NOW Well pray you, father. END
BEGIN NOW Now, good sir, what are you? END
BEGIN NOW A most poor man, made tame to fortune's blows, Who, by the art of known and feeling sorrows, Am pregnant to good pity. END
BEGIN NOW Give me your hand; I'll lead you to some biding. END
BEGIN NOW Hearty thanks. END
BEGIN NOW The bounty and the benison of heaven To boot, and boot! END
BEGIN NOW Enter Steward. END
BEGIN NOW A proclaim'd prize! END
BEGIN NOW Most happy! END
BEGIN NOW That eyeless head of thine was first fram'd flesh To raise my fortunes. END
BEGIN NOW Thou old unhappy traitor, Briefly thyself remember. END
BEGIN NOW The sword is out That must destroy thee. END
BEGIN NOW Now let thy friendly hand Put strength enough to't. END
BEGIN NOW Wherefore, bold peasant, Dar'st thou support a publish'd traitor? END
BEGIN NOW Hence! END
BEGIN NOW Lest that th' infection of his fortune take Like hold on thee. END
BEGIN NOW Let go his arm. END
BEGIN NOW Chill not let go, zir, without vurther 'cagion. END
BEGIN NOW Let go, slave, or thou diest! END
BEGIN NOW Good gentleman, go your gait, and let poor voke pass. END
BEGIN NOW An chud ha' bin zwagger'd out of my life, 'twould not ha' bin zo long as 'tis by a vortnight. END
BEGIN NOW Nay, come not near th' old man. END
BEGIN NOW Keep out, che vore ye, or Ise try whether your costard or my ballow be the harder. END
BEGIN NOW Chill be plain with you. END
BEGIN NOW Out, dunghill! END
BEGIN NOW They fight. END
BEGIN NOW Chill pick your teeth, zir. END
BEGIN NOW Come! END
BEGIN NOW No matter vor your foins. END
BEGIN NOW Slave, thou hast slain me. END
BEGIN NOW Villain, take my purse. END
BEGIN NOW If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my body, And give the letters which thou find'st about me To Edmund Earl of Gloucester. END
BEGIN NOW Seek him out Upon the British party. END
BEGIN NOW O, untimely death! END
BEGIN NOW Death! END
BEGIN NOW He dies. END
BEGIN NOW I know thee well. END
BEGIN NOW A serviceable villain, As duteous to the vices of thy mistress As badness would desire. END
BEGIN NOW What, is he dead? END
BEGIN NOW Sit you down, father; rest you. END
BEGIN NOW Let's see his pockets; these letters that he speaks of May be my friends. END
BEGIN NOW He's dead. END
BEGIN NOW I am only sorry He had no other deathsman. END
BEGIN NOW Let us see. END
BEGIN NOW Leave, gentle wax; and, manners, blame us not. END
BEGIN NOW To know our enemies' minds, we'ld rip their hearts; Their papers, is more lawful. END
BEGIN NOW Reads the letter. END
BEGIN NOW 'Let our reciprocal vows be rememb'red. END
BEGIN NOW You have many opportunities to cut him off. END
BEGIN NOW If your will want not, time and place will be fruitfully offer'd. END
BEGIN NOW There is nothing done, if he return the conqueror. END
BEGIN NOW Then am I the prisoner, and his bed my jail; from the loathed warmth whereof deliver me, and supply the place for your labour. END
BEGIN NOW 'Your (wife, so I would say) affectionate servant, ' ' O indistinguish'd space of woman's will! END
BEGIN NOW A plot upon her virtuous husband's life, And the exchange my brother! END
BEGIN NOW Here in the sands Thee I'll rake up, the post unsanctified Of murtherous lechers; and in the mature time With this ungracious paper strike the sight Of the death-practis'd Duke, For him 'tis well That of thy death and business I can tell. END
BEGIN NOW The King is mad. END
BEGIN NOW How stiff is my vile sense, That I stand up, and have ingenious feeling Of my huge sorrows! END
BEGIN NOW Better I were distract. END
BEGIN NOW So should my thoughts be sever'd from my griefs, And woes by wrong imaginations lose The knowledge of themselves. END
BEGIN NOW A drum afar off. END
BEGIN NOW Give me your hand. END
BEGIN NOW Far off methinks I hear the beaten drum. END
BEGIN NOW Come, father, I'll bestow you with a friend. END
BEGIN NOW Scene VII. END
BEGIN NOW A tent in the French camp. END
BEGIN NOW Enter Cordelia, Kent, Doctor, and Gentleman. END
BEGIN NOW O thou good Kent, how shall I live and work To match thy goodness? END
BEGIN NOW My life will be too short And every measure fail me. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW To be acknowledg'd, madam, is o'erpaid. END
BEGIN NOW All my reports go with the modest truth; Nor more nor clipp'd, but so. END
BEGIN NOW Be better suited. END
BEGIN NOW These weeds are memories of those worser hours. END
BEGIN NOW I prithee put them off. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Pardon, dear madam. END
BEGIN NOW Yet to be known shortens my made intent. END
BEGIN NOW My boon I make it that you know me not Till time and I think meet. END
BEGIN NOW Then be't so, my good lord. END
BEGIN NOW How, does the King? END
BEGIN NOW Madam, sleeps still. END
BEGIN NOW O you kind gods, Cure this great breach in his abused nature! END
BEGIN NOW Th' untun'd and jarring senses, O, wind up Of this child-changed father! END
BEGIN NOW So please your Majesty That we may wake the King? END
BEGIN NOW He hath slept long. END
BEGIN NOW Be govern'd by your knowledge, and proceed I' th' sway of your own will. END
BEGIN NOW Is he array'd? END
BEGIN NOW Enter Lear in a chair carried by Servants. END
BEGIN NOW Ay, madam. END
BEGIN NOW In the heaviness of sleep We put fresh garments on him. END
BEGIN NOW Be by, good madam, when we do awake him. END
BEGIN NOW I doubt not of his temperance. END
BEGIN NOW Very well. END
BEGIN NOW Music. END
BEGIN NOW Please you draw near. END
BEGIN NOW Louder the music there! END
BEGIN NOW O my dear father, restoration hang Thy medicine on my lips, and let this kiss Repair those violent harms that my two sisters Have in thy reverence made! END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Kind and dear princess! END
BEGIN NOW Had you not been their father, these white flakes Had challeng'd pity of them. END
BEGIN NOW Was this a face To be oppos'd against the warring winds? END
BEGIN NOW To stand against the deep dread-bolted thunder? END
BEGIN NOW In the most terrible and nimble stroke Of quick cross lightning? END
BEGIN NOW to watch- poor perdu!- With this thin helm? END
BEGIN NOW Mine enemy's dog, Though he had bit me, should have stood that night Against my fire; and wast thou fain, poor father, To hovel thee with swine and rogues forlorn, In short and musty straw? END
BEGIN NOW Alack, alack! END
BEGIN NOW 'Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once Had not concluded all.- He wakes. END
BEGIN NOW Speak to him. END
BEGIN NOW Madam, do you; 'tis fittest. END
BEGIN NOW How does my royal lord? END
BEGIN NOW How fares your Majesty? END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW You do me wrong to take me out o' th' grave. END
BEGIN NOW Thou art a soul in bliss; but I am bound Upon a wheel of fire, that mine own tears Do scald like molten lead. END
BEGIN NOW Sir, do you know me? END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW You are a spirit, I know. END
BEGIN NOW When did you die? END
BEGIN NOW Still, still, far wide! END
BEGIN NOW He's scarce awake. END
BEGIN NOW Let him alone awhile. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Where have I been? END
BEGIN NOW Where am I? END
BEGIN NOW Fair daylight, I am mightily abus'd. END
BEGIN NOW I should e'en die with pity, To see another thus. END
BEGIN NOW I know not what to say. END
BEGIN NOW I will not swear these are my hands. END
BEGIN NOW Let's see. END
BEGIN NOW I feel this pin prick. END
BEGIN NOW Would I were assur'd Of my condition! END
BEGIN NOW O, look upon me, sir, And hold your hands in benediction o'er me. END
BEGIN NOW No, sir, you must not kneel. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Pray, do not mock me. END
BEGIN NOW I am a very foolish fond old man, Fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor less; And, to deal plainly, I fear I am not in my perfect mind. END
BEGIN NOW Methinks I should know you, and know this man; Yet I am doubtful; for I am mainly ignorant What place this is; and all the skill I have Remembers not these garments; nor I know not Where I did lodge last night. END
BEGIN NOW Do not laugh at me; For (as I am a man) I think this lady To be my child Cordelia. END
BEGIN NOW And so I am! END
BEGIN NOW I am! END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Be your tears wet? END
BEGIN NOW Yes, faith. END
BEGIN NOW I pray weep not. END
BEGIN NOW If you have poison for me, I will drink it. END
BEGIN NOW I know you do not love me; for your sisters Have, as I do remember, done me wrong. END
BEGIN NOW You have some cause, they have not. END
BEGIN NOW No cause, no cause. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Am I in France? END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW In your own kingdom, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Do not abuse me. END
BEGIN NOW Be comforted, good madam. END
BEGIN NOW The great rage You see is kill'd in him; and yet it is danger To make him even o'er the time he has lost. END
BEGIN NOW Desire him to go in. END
BEGIN NOW Trouble him no more Till further settling. END
BEGIN NOW Will't please your Highness walk? END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW You must bear with me. END
BEGIN NOW Pray you now, forget and forgive. END
BEGIN NOW I am old and foolish. END
BEGIN NOW Manent Kent and Gentleman. END
BEGIN NOW Holds it true, sir, that the Duke of Cornwall was so slain? END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Most certain, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Who is conductor of his people? END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW As 'tis said, the bastard son of Gloucester. END
BEGIN NOW They say Edgar, his banish'd son, is with the Earl of Kent in Germany. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Report is changeable. END
BEGIN NOW 'Tis time to look about; the powers of the kingdom approach apace. END
BEGIN NOW The arbitrement is like to be bloody. END
BEGIN NOW Fare you well, sir. END
BEGIN NOW Kent. END
BEGIN NOW My point and period will be throughly wrought, Or well or ill, as this day's battle's fought. END
BEGIN NOW Exit. END
BEGIN NOW ACT V. Scene I. END
BEGIN NOW The British camp near Dover. END
BEGIN NOW Enter, with Drum and Colours, Edmund, Regan, Gentleman, and Soldiers. END
BEGIN NOW Know of the Duke if his last purpose hold, Or whether since he is advis'd by aught To change the course. END
BEGIN NOW He's full of alteration And self-reproving. END
BEGIN NOW Bring his constant pleasure. END
BEGIN NOW Our sister's man is certainly miscarried. END
BEGIN NOW Tis to be doubted, madam. END
BEGIN NOW Now, sweet lord, You know the goodness I intend upon you. END
BEGIN NOW Tell me- but truly- but then speak the truth- Do you not love my sister? END
BEGIN NOW In honour'd love. END
BEGIN NOW But have you never found my brother's way To the forfended place? END
BEGIN NOW That thought abuses you. END
BEGIN NOW I am doubtful that you have been conjunct And bosom'd with her, as far as we call hers. END
BEGIN NOW No, by mine honour, madam. END
BEGIN NOW I never shall endure her. END
BEGIN NOW Dear my lord, Be not familiar with her. END
BEGIN NOW Fear me not. END
BEGIN NOW She and the Duke her husband! END
BEGIN NOW Enter, with Drum and Colours, Albany, I had rather lose the battle than that sister Should loosen him and me. END
BEGIN NOW Our very loving sister, well bemet. END
BEGIN NOW Sir, this I hear: the King is come to his daughter, With others whom the rigour of our state Forc'd to cry out. END
BEGIN NOW Where I could not be honest, I never yet was valiant. END
BEGIN NOW For this business, It toucheth us as France invades our land, Not bolds the King, with others whom, I fear, Most just and heavy causes make oppose. END
BEGIN NOW Sir, you speak nobly. END
BEGIN NOW Why is this reason'd? END
BEGIN NOW Combine together 'gainst the enemy; For these domestic and particular broils Are not the question here. END
BEGIN NOW Let's then determine With th' ancient of war on our proceeding. END
BEGIN NOW I shall attend you presently at your tent. END
BEGIN NOW Sister, you'll go with us? END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW 'Tis most convenient. END
BEGIN NOW Pray you go with us. END
BEGIN NOW O, ho, I know the riddle.- I will go. END
BEGIN NOW If e'er your Grace had speech with man so poor, Hear me one word. END
BEGIN NOW I'll overtake you.- Speak. END
BEGIN NOW Exeunt Before you fight the battle, ope this letter. END
BEGIN NOW If you have victory, let the trumpet sound For him that brought it. END
BEGIN NOW Wretched though I seem, I can produce a champion that will prove What is avouched there. END
BEGIN NOW If you miscarry, Your business of the world hath so an end, And machination ceases. END
BEGIN NOW Fortune love you! END
BEGIN NOW Stay till I have read the letter. END
BEGIN NOW I was forbid it. END
BEGIN NOW When time shall serve, let but the herald cry, And I'll appear again. END
BEGIN NOW Why, fare thee well. END
BEGIN NOW I will o'erlook thy paper. END
BEGIN NOW Exit Enter Edmund. END
BEGIN NOW The enemy 's in view; draw up your powers. END
BEGIN NOW Here is the guess of their true strength and forces By diligent discovery; but your haste Is now urg'd on you. END
BEGIN NOW We will greet the time. END
BEGIN NOW Exit. END
BEGIN NOW To both these sisters have I sworn my love; Each jealous of the other, as the stung Are of the adder. END
BEGIN NOW Which of them shall I take? END
BEGIN NOW Both? END
BEGIN NOW one? END
BEGIN NOW or neither? END
BEGIN NOW Neither can be enjoy'd, If both remain alive. END
BEGIN NOW To take the widow Exasperates, makes mad her sister Goneril; And hardly shall I carry out my side, Her husband being alive. END
BEGIN NOW Now then, we'll use His countenance for the battle, which being done, Let her who would be rid of him devise His speedy taking off. END
BEGIN NOW As for the mercy Which he intends to Lear and to Cordelia- The battle done, and they within our power, Shall never see his pardon; for my state Stands on me to defend, not to debate. END
BEGIN NOW Exit. END
BEGIN NOW Scene II. END
BEGIN NOW A field between the two camps. END
BEGIN NOW Alarum within. END
BEGIN NOW Enter, with Drum and Colours, the Powers of France over the stage, Cordelia with her Father in her hand, and exeunt. END
BEGIN NOW Enter Edgar and Gloucester. END
BEGIN NOW Here, father, take the shadow of this tree For your good host. END
BEGIN NOW Pray that the right may thrive. END
BEGIN NOW If ever I return to you again, I'll bring you comfort. END
BEGIN NOW Grace go with you, sir! END
BEGIN NOW Exit Alarum and retreat within. END
BEGIN NOW Enter Edgar, Away, old man! END
BEGIN NOW give me thy hand! END
BEGIN NOW away! END
BEGIN NOW King Lear hath lost, he and his daughter ta'en. END
BEGIN NOW Give me thy hand! END
BEGIN NOW come on! END
BEGIN NOW No further, sir. END
BEGIN NOW A man may rot even here. END
BEGIN NOW What, in ill thoughts again? END
BEGIN NOW Men must endure Their going hence, even as their coming hither; Ripeness is all. END
BEGIN NOW Come on. END
BEGIN NOW And that's true too. END
BEGIN NOW Scene III. END
BEGIN NOW The British camp, near Dover. END
BEGIN NOW Enter, in conquest, with Drum and Colours, Edmund; Lear and Cordelia as prisoners; Soldiers, Captain. END
BEGIN NOW Some officers take them away. END
BEGIN NOW Good guard Until their greater pleasures first be known That are to censure them. END
BEGIN NOW We are not the first Who with best meaning have incurr'd the worst. END
BEGIN NOW For thee, oppressed king, am I cast down; Myself could else outfrown false Fortune's frown. END
BEGIN NOW Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters? END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW No, no, no, no! END
BEGIN NOW Come, let's away to prison. END
BEGIN NOW We two alone will sing like birds i' th' cage. END
BEGIN NOW When thou dost ask me blessing, I'll kneel down And ask of thee forgiveness. END
BEGIN NOW So we'll live, And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh At gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues Talk of court news; and we'll talk with them too- Who loses and who wins; who's in, who's out- And take upon 's the mystery of things, As if we were God's spies; and we'll wear out, In a wall'd prison, packs and sects of great ones That ebb and flow by th' moon. END
BEGIN NOW Take them away. END
BEGIN NOW Lear. END
BEGIN NOW Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia, The gods themselves throw incense. END
BEGIN NOW Have I caught thee? END
BEGIN NOW He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven And fire us hence like foxes. END

BEGIN NOW The bloody proclamation to escape That follow'd me so near (O, our lives' sweetness! END
BEGIN NOW That with the pain of death would hourly die Rather than die at once!) END
BEGIN NOW taught me to shift Into a madman's rags, t' assume a semblance That very dogs disdain'd; and in this habit Met I my father with his bleeding rings, Their precious stones new lost; became his guide, Led him, begg'd for him, sav'd him from despair; Never (O fault!) END
BEGIN NOW reveal'd myself unto him Until some half hour past, when I was arm'd, Not sure, though hoping of this good success, I ask'd his blessing, and from first to last Told him my pilgrimage. END
BEGIN NOW But his flaw'd heart (Alack, too weak the conflict to support!) END
BEGIN NOW 'Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief, Burst smilingly. END
BEGIN NOW This speech of yours hath mov'd me, And shall perchance do good; but speak you on; You look as you had something more to say. END
BEGIN NOW If there be more, more woful, hold it in; For I am almost ready to dissolve, Hearing of this. END
BEGIN NOW This would have seem'd a period To such as love not sorrow; but another, To amplify too much, would make much more, And top extremity. END
BEGIN NOW Whilst I was big in clamour, came there a man, Who, having seen me in my worst estate, Shunn'd my abhorr'd society; but then, finding Who 'twas that so endur'd, with his strong arms He fastened on my neck, and bellowed out As he'd burst heaven; threw him on my father; Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him That ever ear receiv'd; which in recounting His grief grew puissant, and the strings of life Began to crack. END
BEGIN NOW Twice then the trumpets sounded, And there I left him tranc'd. END
BEGIN NOW But who was this? END
BEGIN NOW Kent, sir, the banish'd Kent; who in disguise Followed his enemy king and did him service Improper for a slave. END
BEGIN NOW Enter a Gentleman with a bloody knife. END
BEGIN NOW Help, help! END
BEGIN NOW O, help! END
BEGIN NOW What kind of help? END
BEGIN NOW Speak, man. END
BEGIN NOW What means that bloody knife? END
BEGIN NOW 'Tis hot, it smokes. END

BEGIN NOW Your lady, sir, your lady! END
BEGIN NOW and her sister By her is poisoned; she hath confess'd it. END

BEGIN NOW Enter Kent. END
BEGIN NOW Here comes Kent. END

BEGIN NOW Even so. END
BEGIN NOW Cover their faces. END
BEGIN NOW I pant for life. END
BEGIN NOW Some good I mean to do, Despite of mine own nature. END
BEGIN NOW Quickly send (Be brief in't) to the castle; for my writ Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia. END
BEGIN NOW Nay, send in time. END
BEGIN NOW Run, run, O, run! END
BEGIN NOW To who, my lord? END

BEGIN NOW Had I your tongues and eyes, I'ld use them so That heaven's vault should crack. END

BEGIN NOW His hide is tough, it stinks. END

BEGIN NOW Like me, old Hidetora... Would you eat me?. END
BEGIN NOW You'd stick in our throats. END
BEGIN NOW That's why I joined the hunt, to reinforce our friendship. END
BEGIN NOW I, too! END
BEGIN NOW I would cement the bonds between the houses of lchimonji and Ayabe by marrying my daughter to your son Saburo. END
BEGIN NOW Hold on! END
BEGIN NOW That's my own intention. END
BEGIN NOW Lord lchimonji, the day is propitious. END
BEGIN NOW Give us your answer. END

BEGIN NOW After Saburo's insult, how else could he save face?. END
BEGIN NOW All he did was hunt. END
BEGIN NOW In the old days he'd rout an army and not be winded. END

BEGIN NOW Father, what is it?. END
BEGIN NOW Are you ill?. END
BEGIN NOW Father... A dream. END

BEGIN NOW I called, I shouted, but no one answered. END
BEGIN NOW I was alone. END
BEGIN NOW Alone in the wide world. END
BEGIN NOW I felt a chill... END
BEGIN NOW Such stupidity! END
BEGIN NOW Taro's voice pulled me back. END
BEGIN NOW I saw my beloved children. END
BEGIN NOW Taro... Jiro... and Saburo. END
BEGIN NOW Father, I've never seen you like this. END
BEGIN NOW It's not right. END
BEGIN NOW Quiet, Saburo! END
BEGIN NOW Be thankful we have his affection. END
BEGIN NOW I'm puzzled, too. END
BEGIN NOW I can scarcely believe my ears. END
BEGIN NOW Normally all he asks is our obedience. END
BEGIN NOW That's affection enough. END
BEGIN NOW All right. END
BEGIN NOW I've been considering an idea and I've reached a decision. END
BEGIN NOW I want to tell it to you. END
BEGIN NOW Now is a good time to do it, while Lords Fujimaki and Ayabe are with us. END
BEGIN NOW Bring them! END
BEGIN NOW I, Hidetora lchimonji, was born in that small castle in the mountains. END
BEGIN NOW At that time, this entire plain seethed with constant battle. END
BEGIN NOW Many lords vied for power. END
BEGIN NOW At the age of seventeen, I flew my banner over that castle. END
BEGIN NOW I waged war for years and at last the plain was mine. END
BEGIN NOW I hoisted my colours over the main castle. END
BEGIN NOW I spent more years fighting lance to lance with these two gentlemen. END
BEGIN NOW Now the moment has come to stable the steeds of war and give free rein to peace. END
BEGIN NOW But old Hidetora is seventy years old. END
BEGIN NOW I hereby cede total authority over all my dominions to my eldest son T aro. END
BEGIN NOW My Lord, this is so sudden! END
BEGIN NOW Not at all. END
BEGIN NOW I've thought long and hard. END
BEGIN NOW There comes a time to step aside and pass on the reins to younger hands. END
BEGIN NOW I say to you: that time is now! END
BEGIN NOW This is my will. END
BEGIN NOW Taro is now head of the lchimonji, Lord of these lands. END
BEGIN NOW I will quit the castle keep and move to the outer tower. END
BEGIN NOW I will retain a -man escort and the title and insignia of Great Lord. END
BEGIN NOW But the actual leadership lies entirely with T aro. END
BEGIN NOW I expect all of you to obey. END
BEGIN NOW I'll obey. END
BEGIN NOW But what about me and Saburo?. END
BEGIN NOW What do you intend for us?. END
BEGIN NOW I give you, Jiro and Saburo, the second and third castles with their attendant lands. END
BEGIN NOW You will support Taro in the first castle. END
BEGIN NOW I shall be your guest, visiting each castle in turn, Iiving out my remaining years. END
BEGIN NOW How hard... to be old! END
BEGIN NOW I would speak. END
BEGIN NOW I respect your wishes and appreciate your trust but I beg you to reconsider. END
BEGIN NOW Why?. END
BEGIN NOW Though I am your eldest, I could never take your place. END
BEGIN NOW It is too great a task. END
BEGIN NOW I always pray to the God of War, Let his life last years, even if it means shaving a bit off mine. END
BEGIN NOW What a pretty speech. END
BEGIN NOW I cannot use such honeyed words. END
BEGIN NOW I'd be embarrassed. END
BEGIN NOW Don't be spiteful. END
BEGIN NOW You mean that Taro only flatters me?. END
BEGIN NOW Pay no attention to Saburo. END
BEGIN NOW I feel the same as Taro. END
BEGIN NOW We'd like nothing better than to stay behind your shield. END
BEGIN NOW But it's our turn to shield you from life's bitter arrows. END
BEGIN NOW Well said, Jiro. END
BEGIN NOW Bring me that quiver! END
BEGIN NOW Break an arrow in two. END
BEGIN NOW Can you do it?. END
BEGIN NOW Bundle them... and try again. END
BEGIN NOW A single arrow is easily broken. END
BEGIN NOW Not so three together. END
BEGIN NOW Whenever Taro is in trouble if you unite your forces the house of lchimonji will be safe. END
BEGIN NOW Even in a sheaf, three arrows can be broken. END
BEGIN NOW More of your pranks! END
BEGIN NOW Stop being foolish. END
BEGIN NOW It's you who are foolish. END
BEGIN NOW Your plan is absurd. END
BEGIN NOW You are either senile or mad. END
BEGIN NOW Silence! END
BEGIN NOW Do not insult your father. END
BEGIN NOW What madness have I spoken?. END
BEGIN NOW Wherein lies my senility?. END
BEGIN NOW I'll tell you. END
BEGIN NOW What kind of world do we live in?. END
BEGIN NOW One barren of loyalty and feeling. END
BEGIN NOW I'm aware of that! END
BEGIN NOW So you should be! END
BEGIN NOW You spilled merciless blood. END
BEGIN NOW You showed no mercy, no pity. END
BEGIN NOW We too are children of this age, weaned on strife and chaos. END
BEGIN NOW We are your sons, yet you count on our fidelity?. END
BEGIN NOW In my eyes, that makes you a fool. END
BEGIN NOW A senile old fool! END
BEGIN NOW So that's it! END
BEGIN NOW You mean that one day you'll forget I'm your father and betray me?. END
BEGIN NOW More folly! END
BEGIN NOW Does a traitor betray himself?. END
BEGIN NOW Then you mean your brothers?. END
BEGIN NOW He's jealous of Taro's position. END
BEGIN NOW Is that why you slander me?. END
BEGIN NOW Brother or not, watch your step! END
BEGIN NOW Your lesson of the three arrows was wasted. END
BEGIN NOW The unity of the three sons is split. END
BEGIN NOW The indignity! END
BEGIN NOW You scorn your father's wishes?. END
BEGIN NOW Parents and children have no place in this world. END
BEGIN NOW Very well! END
BEGIN NOW I cut the bond between us. END
BEGIN NOW You are a stranger to me. END
BEGIN NOW Out of my sight! END
BEGIN NOW You mustn't. END
BEGIN NOW Quiet, Tango. END
BEGIN NOW My mistake was to love him too well. END
BEGIN NOW I spoiled him. END
BEGIN NOW It's my fault he's arrogant. END
BEGIN NOW But it's too late for regrets. END
BEGIN NOW When flesh is rotten, even our own, cut it away! END
BEGIN NOW Wait, My Lord! END
BEGIN NOW Master Saburo is blunt, perhaps even disrespectful. END
BEGIN NOW But his words are honest and come from the heart. END
BEGIN NOW Consider well. END
BEGIN NOW You will find he is not wrong. END
BEGIN NOW Silence! END
BEGIN NOW I will speak! END
BEGIN NOW Begone! END
BEGIN NOW I will stay! END
BEGIN NOW You disobey me?. END
BEGIN NOW My duty is to speak my mind. END
BEGIN NOW Brandish your sword. END
BEGIN NOW I won't move. END
BEGIN NOW How dare you! END
BEGIN NOW Revoke this rash decision. END
BEGIN NOW Your insolence matches his. END
BEGIN NOW I will not have it! END
BEGIN NOW I banish you both! END
BEGIN NOW Father! END
BEGIN NOW What misery! END
BEGIN NOW What will you do now?. END
BEGIN NOW I grieve for Father, not myself. END
BEGIN NOW The horror ahead of him... END
BEGIN NOW Tango, you're an idiot! END
BEGIN NOW Why?. END
BEGIN NOW For defending me. END
BEGIN NOW Your place is with Father. END
BEGIN NOW He needs you. END
BEGIN NOW They're following us. END
BEGIN NOW Wait! END
BEGIN NOW Why do you run away, son-in-law?. END
BEGIN NOW Son-in-law?. END
BEGIN NOW Hear me out. END
BEGIN NOW You're in disgrace, exiled from your lands. END
BEGIN NOW Lord Ayabe and l witnessed the whole incident. END
BEGIN NOW You are an outcast, little more than a beggar. END
BEGIN NOW Forgive my rudeness. END
BEGIN NOW What I'm trying to say... END
BEGIN NOW I can't find the words. END
BEGIN NOW The meaning is clear. END
BEGIN NOW No lord chooses a beggar... For his daughter. END
BEGIN NOW Of course not. END
BEGIN NOW No... Now hold on! END
BEGIN NOW Lord Ayabe rejected the marriage. END
BEGIN NOW But on my way home I got to thinking of your extraordinary conduct. END
BEGIN NOW I like the way you spoke up. END
BEGIN NOW You have character. END
BEGIN NOW You'd make a fine son-in-law. END
BEGIN NOW I retraced my steps but you had gone. END
BEGIN NOW Does my offer interest you?. END
BEGIN NOW How can I know?. END
BEGIN NOW Then come stay with me while you think it over. END
BEGIN NOW You too, T ango. END
BEGIN NOW You are honest and loyal. END
BEGIN NOW I can use you. END
BEGIN NOW Will you come?. END
BEGIN NOW Thank you for your generosity, but I cannot accept. END
BEGIN NOW Whatever disguise I must adopt, I shan't abandon the Great Lord. END
BEGIN NOW What's going on?. END
BEGIN NOW Hidetora's concubines are moving from the keep. END
BEGIN NOW Please excuse the delay. END
BEGIN NOW Scandalous! END
BEGIN NOW I am now the mistress. END
BEGIN NOW They must make way for me. END
BEGIN NOW My women, kneeling to Taro's wife?. END
BEGIN NOW Intolerable! END
BEGIN NOW Why do you say that?. END
BEGIN NOW You gave him the castle keep. END
BEGIN NOW It's only natural. END
BEGIN NOW Gives away his house, gives away his land His bounty earns him a new title Lord of the rice fields A scarecrow!. END
BEGIN NOW You call me a fool?. END
BEGIN NOW No, the fool is me, for serving as butt to your laughing-stock. END
BEGIN NOW But you're another for losing your keep! END
BEGIN NOW How dare you! END
BEGIN NOW Kaede... the view is more pleasant now that this is mine. END
BEGIN NOW As I recall, a banner used to hang there. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, Father's banner. END
BEGIN NOW Also his helmet and armour. END
BEGIN NOW Where are they?. END
BEGIN NOW I gave them to Father's men. END
BEGIN NOW The armour doesn't matter but the banner... Lord, it belongs with the head of the house of lchimonji. END
BEGIN NOW But Father is keeping his title and insignia. END
BEGIN NOW Without them, you are a shadow. END
BEGIN NOW What do you mean?. END
BEGIN NOW He made it clear. END
BEGIN NOW I am now in command. END
BEGIN NOW In that case, behave as if you are. END
BEGIN NOW You want the banner?. END
BEGIN NOW Ridiculous! END
BEGIN NOW You take back what you give. END
BEGIN NOW It is Lord Taro's order! END
BEGIN NOW See the Lord, a gourd in the wind Swinging this way Swaying that way Swinging as the breeze blows So high up Dangling hollow from the tower... END
BEGIN NOW Isn't it fun?. END
BEGIN NOW Villain! END
BEGIN NOW I'll teach you! END
BEGIN NOW See the Lord, a gourd in the wind Swinging this way Swaying that way Swinging as the breeze blows So high up Dangling hollow from the tower... What fun, what fun! END
BEGIN NOW Who goes there?. END
BEGIN NOW It's Ogura. END
BEGIN NOW I have a message. END
BEGIN NOW Lord T aro is holding a family gathering to celebrate the transfer of power. END
BEGIN NOW He invites his honoured father. END
BEGIN NOW You too, Lord lkoma. END
BEGIN NOW Your family gathering is only us?. END
BEGIN NOW Please, Father-in-law, won't you sit down?. END
BEGIN NOW I am to sit below you?. END
BEGIN NOW Who am l?. END
BEGIN NOW The honourable father of my husband. END
BEGIN NOW Is that all?. END
BEGIN NOW Is the Great Lord dead?. END
BEGIN NOW Don't joke. END
BEGIN NOW I'm not joking! END
BEGIN NOW I retain my title and my status. END
BEGIN NOW Have you forgotten?. END
BEGIN NOW No, of course not. END
BEGIN NOW You gave full authority to me. END
BEGIN NOW Did you forget?. END
BEGIN NOW What do you want?. END
BEGIN NOW I gave you this castle. END
BEGIN NOW I moved out, reduced my escort. END
BEGIN NOW They may be few in number, but they're boisterous enough. END
BEGIN NOW What is that song?. END
BEGIN NOW With such goings-on, how can I make myself obeyed?. END
BEGIN NOW They are warriors, unschooled in manners. END
BEGIN NOW They like comic songs. END
BEGIN NOW Comic songs can go too far. END
BEGIN NOW That song makes fun of me. END
BEGIN NOW My guard was defending my honour, yet you went ahead and killed him. END
BEGIN NOW I cannot allow that. END
BEGIN NOW This once I'll overlook it, but I must have your promise that it won't happen again. END
BEGIN NOW You will sign this and seal it with your blood. END
BEGIN NOW A pledge?. END
BEGIN NOW This is nonsense! END
BEGIN NOW Read it. END
BEGIN NOW Pledge. END
BEGIN NOW Firstly, l cede to Taro Takatora the domains of lchimonji. END
BEGIN NOW Secondly, l make him sole ruler of the house of lchimonji. END
BEGIN NOW Thirdly, though I am Taro's father, l shall submit to his authority and act accordingly. END
BEGIN NOW l swear by all the deities, may they punish me if I disobey. END
BEGIN NOW I'm to seal this silly thing with my blood?. END
BEGIN NOW Everything it contains was proclaimed by you yourself before witnesses. END
BEGIN NOW What does it change if you sign it?. END
BEGIN NOW Are you a son?. END
BEGIN NOW What do you mean?. END
BEGIN NOW Is this a son's attitude?. END
BEGIN NOW The hen pecks the cock and makes him crow! END
BEGIN NOW I will not stay here. END
BEGIN NOW Fortunately, I have another son. END
BEGIN NOW Thank you, you did well. END
BEGIN NOW I was born and raised in this castle. END
BEGIN NOW It belonged to my father. END
BEGIN NOW I left it to marry you. END
BEGIN NOW My father and brothers relaxed their vigilance after the marriage, and Hidetora murdered them. END
BEGIN NOW Now I am back in my family castle. END
BEGIN NOW How I have longed for this day. END
BEGIN NOW My mother took her own life in this very room. END
BEGIN NOW Father is on his way. END
BEGIN NOW My brother sent him packing. END
BEGIN NOW He says Father grows eccentric, and it would be unwise to let him stay here. END
BEGIN NOW Father's counsellor, lkoma, is privy to my brother's plans. END
BEGIN NOW This severity is unlike Lord T aro. END
BEGIN NOW And you, Lord, why do you do nothing?. END
BEGIN NOW He's right. END
BEGIN NOW You should succeed the Great Lord. END
BEGIN NOW Lord Taro is a weakling. END
BEGIN NOW The stake is large. END
BEGIN NOW Gamble for it. END
BEGIN NOW Then you are all willing to gamble with me?. END
BEGIN NOW Absolutely. END
BEGIN NOW Dogs turn on a master who gives up the chase. END
BEGIN NOW Sound the horn or become the quarry. END
BEGIN NOW How the dogs howl! END
BEGIN NOW I must say, I find it unfair. END
BEGIN NOW Born twelve months after Taro, so all my life I must grovel at his feet. END
BEGIN NOW Crack these bonds! END
BEGIN NOW Good for you, My Lord! END
BEGIN NOW Don't lick your chops yet. END
BEGIN NOW Listen... Taro is easy pickings. END
BEGIN NOW His wife, Lady Kaede, is another story. END
BEGIN NOW Quite true. END
BEGIN NOW She'd be a perfect match for you. END
BEGIN NOW Why not steal her?. END
BEGIN NOW Don't be impertinent. END
BEGIN NOW First of all, there's Father. END
BEGIN NOW He still has thirty warriors. END
BEGIN NOW Each one is worth a thousand. END
BEGIN NOW He'll soon be here and so will they. END
BEGIN NOW Any ideas?. END
BEGIN NOW Open the gates! END
BEGIN NOW Hidetora is here! END
BEGIN NOW The Great Lord is here! END
BEGIN NOW I will seek out Sue first. END
BEGIN NOW Tell Jiro I want to see him. END
BEGIN NOW Sue! END
BEGIN NOW Praise be to the Eternal Western Paradise Praise be to the Eternal Buddha In trillion manifestations Praise be to Amida Buddha... END
BEGIN NOW I knew you'd be here. END
BEGIN NOW Father-in-law! END
BEGIN NOW Never m ind the ceremony. END
BEGIN NOW It's been a long time. END
BEGIN NOW Let me look at you. END
BEGIN NOW Still the same sad face. END
BEGIN NOW When I see you, it breaks my heart. END
BEGIN NOW It's worse when you smile. END
BEGIN NOW I burnt down your castle. END
BEGIN NOW Your father and mother perished. END
BEGIN NOW And you look at me like that. END
BEGIN NOW Look upon me with hatred! END
BEGIN NOW It would be easier to bear. END
BEGIN NOW Go on, hate me! END
BEGIN NOW I don't hate you. END
BEGIN NOW All is decided in our previous lives. END
BEGIN NOW The Buddha embraces all things. END
BEGIN NOW Buddha again! END
BEGIN NOW He is gone from this evil world. END
BEGIN NOW His guardians are in exile. END
BEGIN NOW We can't rely on Buddha's mercy. END
BEGIN NOW There you are, Jiro! END
BEGIN NOW I've come to be your guest. END
BEGIN NOW I'm disappointed in Taro. END
BEGIN NOW I already know. END
BEGIN NOW It's all in my brother's letter. END
BEGIN NOW Taro wrote to you?. END
BEGIN NOW He says your guards were unruly and vulgar. END
BEGIN NOW I am to receive you with courtesy, but I cannot let your warriors inside the castle walls. END
BEGIN NOW What's this?. END
BEGIN NOW I'm to come in alone, leaving my men to rot outside?. END
BEGIN NOW My brother is the head of the clan. END
BEGIN NOW I have no choice but to obey him. END
BEGIN NOW If you dislike his conditions, then it might be best to go back and apologise. END
BEGIN NOW Apologise to Taro?. END
BEGIN NOW Go back?. END
BEGIN NOW Stop! END
BEGIN NOW Lord Kurogane! END
BEGIN NOW Lord Shirane! END
BEGIN NOW What does this mean?. END
BEGIN NOW Lord lkoma! END
BEGIN NOW An order from Hidetora. END
BEGIN NOW We arrived suddenly. END
BEGIN NOW The castle is unprepared. END
BEGIN NOW Withdraw and wait outside. END
BEGIN NOW Enough is enough! END
BEGIN NOW I understand! END
BEGIN NOW You too, you're just like Taro. END
BEGIN NOW You want to be rid of me. END
BEGIN NOW I'm too much trouble. END
BEGIN NOW That's not true. END
BEGIN NOW If you were alone, I'd welcome you gladly. END
BEGIN NOW The Great Lord goes nowhere alone. END
BEGIN NOW You renounced your power. END
BEGIN NOW You have no need of an escort. END
BEGIN NOW Only the birds and the beasts Iive in solitude. END
BEGIN NOW I've heard enough excuses! END
BEGIN NOW Open the gates! END
BEGIN NOW You needn't worry. END
BEGIN NOW It's not for my men to enter, but for me to leave! END
BEGIN NOW Open the gates! END
BEGIN NOW Now close them! END
BEGIN NOW I will not see you again. END
BEGIN NOW Ever! END
BEGIN NOW The villages are deserted. END
BEGIN NOW Not a grain of rice anywhere. END
BEGIN NOW The peasants took everything and fled to the mountains. END
BEGIN NOW My Lord! END
BEGIN NOW We must go to the third castle. END
BEGIN NOW It was your first victory. END
BEGIN NOW Go back... No, lkoma! END
BEGIN NOW If I could do that, would I roam the plain hungry?. END
BEGIN NOW Use your head! END
BEGIN NOW What kind of welcome would I get, I, who banished the lord of the castle?. END
BEGIN NOW By order of Lord Taro Takatora, head of the lchimonji clan, I take possession of this castle. END
BEGIN NOW Open the gates! END
BEGIN NOW Without our master, Saburo, the castle is nothing to us. END
BEGIN NOW We leave it to you. END
BEGIN NOW We will follow him and die for him. END
BEGIN NOW We hear he is with Lord Fujimaki. END
BEGIN NOW We go to join him! END
BEGIN NOW It's Tango! END
BEGIN NOW I have rice, bean curd, plums... END
BEGIN NOW I followed you and saw how you suffered. END
BEGIN NOW Though banished, I am still your loyal vassal. END
BEGIN NOW Is it really Tango?. END
BEGIN NOW Hold on! END
BEGIN NOW Don't take charity from peasants. END
BEGIN NOW A samurai will starve rather than beg. END
BEGIN NOW The peasants are presumptuous. END
BEGIN NOW Burn their villages! END
BEGIN NOW Wait, My Lord! END
BEGIN NOW Don't blame the peasants. END
BEGIN NOW Rather than disobey Taro's decree, they fled. END
BEGIN NOW What decree?. END
BEGIN NOW That you are banished. END
BEGIN NOW Anyone who helps you... will die. END
BEGIN NOW Now I understand. END
BEGIN NOW You tried to warn me of this. END
BEGIN NOW Your humble servant. END
BEGIN NOW Laugh, Tango! END
BEGIN NOW Wretched Hidetora... END
BEGIN NOW Rejected by his children, driven from his castles, with no place to go. END
BEGIN NOW You have a place to go, My Lord. END
BEGIN NOW Master Saburo has found refuge with Lord Fujimaki. END
BEGIN NOW Go to him. END
BEGIN NOW No, I can't. END
BEGIN NOW How could l ever face him?. END
BEGIN NOW Listen to me! END
BEGIN NOW All Saburo wants is your welfare. END
BEGIN NOW If I'm disguised like this, if I followed you so far, it's all thanks to him. END
BEGIN NOW He sent me to protect you. END
BEGIN NOW Saburo's men gave up the castle. END
BEGIN NOW They went to join Lord Fujimaki. END
BEGIN NOW Now Fujimaki's plot is clear. END
BEGIN NOW First he takes Saburo, then Saburo's warriors, then Your Lordship himself. END
BEGIN NOW The lchimonji battle each other. END
BEGIN NOW And he walks off with your land. END
BEGIN NOW That's a lie! END
BEGIN NOW He's not that kind of man. END
BEGIN NOW We must go to the third castle. END
BEGIN NOW But Taro's general has taken it. END
BEGIN NOW Ogura?. END
BEGIN NOW He won't touch us. END
BEGIN NOW What's that?. END
BEGIN NOW What do I smell?. END
BEGIN NOW A very fishy stink! END
BEGIN NOW Ogura has only a few men. END
BEGIN NOW We can beat them easily. END
BEGIN NOW My horse! END
BEGIN NOW That's it, hurry! END
BEGIN NOW Hell is ever at hand, which you cannot say of heaven... Stay behind if you're afraid. END
BEGIN NOW And yet, all we did was tell the truth. END
BEGIN NOW The enemy... END
BEGIN NOW I know. END
BEGIN NOW Call lkoma and Ogura! END
BEGIN NOW They tricked us! END
BEGIN NOW We're surrounded, overwhelmed! END
BEGIN NOW Truly... we are in hell! END
BEGIN NOW Lord Taro is slain! END
BEGIN NOW What?. END
BEGIN NOW So be it! END
BEGIN NOW A stray shot from the tower. END
BEGIN NOW The fortunes of war. END
BEGIN NOW The fates are kinder to you. END
BEGIN NOW And Father?. END
BEGIN NOW He'll commit hara-kiri. END
BEGIN NOW We're lost! END
BEGIN NOW Prepare yourself! END
BEGIN NOW Farewell, My Lord. END
BEGIN NOW Go back! END
BEGIN NOW Lord! END
BEGIN NOW The die is cast, do not falter. END
BEGIN NOW You chose this path, follow it. END
BEGIN NOW It leads to absolute leadership. END
BEGIN NOW You can no longer turn back. END
BEGIN NOW Is he mad?. END
BEGIN NOW And better off for it. END
BEGIN NOW What do you mean?. END
BEGIN NOW My Lord, come to your wits! END
BEGIN NOW In a mad world only the mad are sane. END
BEGIN NOW What do you see?. END
BEGIN NOW Forgive me. END
BEGIN NOW Excellent! END
BEGIN NOW The failed mind sees the heart's failings. END
BEGIN NOW The wonder of it! END
BEGIN NOW I see on this withered plain All those I destroyed A phantom army One by one they come floating Rising before me... Who's there?. END
BEGIN NOW T ravellers stranded by the storm. END
BEGIN NOW Let us stay the night. END
BEGIN NOW My house is too poor for visitors. END
BEGIN NOW We ask nothing special. END
BEGIN NOW I'm sorry, I must be alone. END
BEGIN NOW Why?. END
BEGIN NOW Are you diseased?. END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW Then let us come in. END
BEGIN NOW I cannot. END
BEGIN NOW The one who seeks shelter is the Great Lord himself. END
BEGIN NOW We're coming in. END
BEGIN NOW Our lord was taken ill. END
BEGIN NOW He is wet through. END
BEGIN NOW Bring something to cover him. END
BEGIN NOW I'm cold. END
BEGIN NOW Tango... END
BEGIN NOW He is himself again. END
BEGIN NOW More's the pity. END
BEGIN NOW He is better off mad. END
BEGIN NOW Tango, Iisten to me. END
BEGIN NOW I, Hidetora, was attacked by my own sons. END
BEGIN NOW I was betrayed by my vassal. END
BEGIN NOW That's not the worst. END
BEGIN NOW Because of me, my loyal men died a useless death. END
BEGIN NOW As fate would have it only I survived. END
BEGIN NOW I, who should have died! END
BEGIN NOW You there! END
BEGIN NOW Woman! END
BEGIN NOW I am not a woman. END
BEGIN NOW It's so dark... Bring a light. END
BEGIN NOW I have no light. END
BEGIN NOW I have no need of one. END
BEGIN NOW Are your eyes so poor?. END
BEGIN NOW Are you Lady Sue's brother?. END
BEGIN NOW Young Lord Tsurumaru?. END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Tsurumaru! END
BEGIN NOW It's been a long time... Lord Hidetora. END
BEGIN NOW You remember me?. END
BEGIN NOW How could I forget you?. END
BEGIN NOW I was only a boy, but could I forget the man who burned down our castle?. END
BEGIN NOW Who in exchange for my life gouged out my eyes?. END
BEGIN NOW I try to be like my sister, to pray to Buddha and rid myself of hatred. END
BEGIN NOW But not one day do I forget! END
BEGIN NOW Not one night do I sleep in peace! END
BEGIN NOW I regret I cannot welcome you as befits the Great Lord. END
BEGIN NOW Luckily, my sister gave me a flute. END
BEGIN NOW I will play for you. END
BEGIN NOW Lacking anything else, I give you hospitality of the heart. END
BEGIN NOW It is the only pleasure Ieft to me. END
BEGIN NOW Sister-in-law, here is my brother's hair. END
BEGIN NOW He died in battle. END
BEGIN NOW Unfortunately, it falls on me to bring this unhappy news. END
BEGIN NOW Ogura. END
BEGIN NOW Where is my husband's body?. END
BEGIN NOW In this heat, it was too unsightly to be displayed. END
BEGIN NOW We burned it where it lay. END
BEGIN NOW We held funeral rites at a temple. END
BEGIN NOW Ogura... Where are his armour and helmet?. END
BEGIN NOW You're mocking me. END
BEGIN NOW I'm wearing them. END
BEGIN NOW Surely you recognise them. END
BEGIN NOW Of course. END
BEGIN NOW But I didn't dream you would wear them so soon after his death. END
BEGIN NOW You surprise me. END
BEGIN NOW I had thought my brother would be pleased to see me in his armour. END
BEGIN NOW It was stupid of me. END
BEGIN NOW Forgive me. END
BEGIN NOW Help me take it off. END
BEGIN NOW Sister-in-law, I am about to be naked. END
BEGIN NOW Lords lkoma and Ogura, you have worked well to further our interests. END
BEGIN NOW We appreciate it. END
BEGIN NOW These gifts are a token of thanks. END
BEGIN NOW They're also a parting gift. END
BEGIN NOW Farewell. END
BEGIN NOW Lord Jiro feels it unwise to keep you in his service. END
BEGIN NOW Men who betray one master may betray another. END
BEGIN NOW A reasonable point of view. END
BEGIN NOW Naturally you are disappointed, but bear no grudges. END
BEGIN NOW Is that clear?. END
BEGIN NOW Good. END
BEGIN NOW The Lady Kaede is here. END
BEGIN NOW Send her in. END
BEGIN NOW My apologies for my harsh words. END
BEGIN NOW I am ashamed. END
BEGIN NOW The incident is forgotten. END
BEGIN NOW They say your father has gone mad. END
BEGIN NOW That should please you. END
BEGIN NOW What do you mean by that?. END
BEGIN NOW I spoke frankly, without gilding my thoughts. END
BEGIN NOW Forgive me if I offended. END
BEGIN NOW You must hate my father for what he did to your family. END
BEGIN NOW Am I wrong?. END
BEGIN NOW Now it's my turn to be frank. END
BEGIN NOW You are just as pleased as I am. END
BEGIN NOW Lord Jiro, you are now head of the house of lchimonji. END
BEGIN NOW This helmet is rightfully yours. END
BEGIN NOW I am not blind! END
BEGIN NOW You murdered your brother and stole his title. END
BEGIN NOW Prepare to die! END
BEGIN NOW No! END
BEGIN NOW Even now you deny it?. END
BEGIN NOW It wasn't I who killed my brother. END
BEGIN NOW Then who did?. END
BEGIN NOW Speak! END
BEGIN NOW Who was it?. END
BEGIN NOW It was... Kurogane. END
BEGIN NOW Hypocrite! END
BEGIN NOW You gave the order but won't take the blame. END
BEGIN NOW A fine leader! END
BEGIN NOW You give in so easily. END
BEGIN NOW Now I will tell you the truth. END
BEGIN NOW Lord Jiro, I don't care about Taro's death. END
BEGIN NOW What concerns me is my own future. END
BEGIN NOW I won't be a widow, with my hair cropped, nor a nun, with my head shaved. END
BEGIN NOW This castle was my father's. END
BEGIN NOW I won't leave it. END
BEGIN NOW Lord Jiro, consider my request well. END
BEGIN NOW For my part, I'll say nothing of your abominable crimes. END
BEGIN NOW I won't reproach you or speak against you. END
BEGIN NOW If I did, the kingdom would split. END
BEGIN NOW But always remember. END
BEGIN NOW I can destroy you. END
BEGIN NOW Is it a bargain, Lord Jiro?. END
BEGIN NOW My Lord... END
BEGIN NOW Yes, Sister-in-law?. END
BEGIN NOW Sister-in-law?. END
BEGIN NOW After what we've just done?. END
BEGIN NOW By rights, I really should be your wife. END
BEGIN NOW I have a wife: Sue. END
BEGIN NOW I'll be merely your concubine?. END
BEGIN NOW No! END
BEGIN NOW No! END
BEGIN NOW You're mine! END
BEGIN NOW No one else shall have you. END
BEGIN NOW Don't cry, Kaede. END
BEGIN NOW You won't be just a concubine. END
BEGIN NOW As long as Lady Sue is there... END
BEGIN NOW I'll attend to her. END
BEGIN NOW But how?. END
BEGIN NOW I'll repudiate her. END
BEGIN NOW That's not what I want! END
BEGIN NOW After our ecstasy, I cannot bear it that another woman has known your touch. END
BEGIN NOW Such a woman cannot remain alive. END
BEGIN NOW Well now, look where we are. END
BEGIN NOW If fortune had run true, Tsurumaru would live here. END
BEGIN NOW You shelter in the very ruins of the castle you burned. END
BEGIN NOW Ignorance is bliss indeed. END
BEGIN NOW Your helmet. END
BEGIN NOW Your plumes. END
BEGIN NOW Don't you look regal! END
BEGIN NOW Help, here come demons! END
BEGIN NOW Two of them. END
BEGIN NOW Traitors! END
BEGIN NOW You must pay. END
BEGIN NOW No, wait! END
BEGIN NOW Let us explain! END
BEGIN NOW Save your breath. END
BEGIN NOW I know all about your treachery. END
BEGIN NOW Die, traitor! END
BEGIN NOW Jiro killed Taro. END
BEGIN NOW Madness saved Hidetora. END
BEGIN NOW If he recovers his wits, he'll be killed too. END
BEGIN NOW Jiro slew Taro, our lord is next. END
BEGIN NOW We must take him to Master Saburo. END
BEGIN NOW If only we could. END
BEGIN NOW Mention Saburo and he runs away. END
BEGIN NOW He doesn't dare face him. END
BEGIN NOW On that point he's sane. END
BEGIN NOW What about Master Saburo?. END
BEGIN NOW Would you like to see him?. END
BEGIN NOW The only way is to bring Saburo here. END
BEGIN NOW Maybe he can talk sense to him. END
BEGIN NOW I'll be back as soon as I can. END
BEGIN NOW Take good care of him. END
BEGIN NOW Lady Kaede leads you by the nose. END
BEGIN NOW If you wish to marry, fine. END
BEGIN NOW But to kill Lady Sue for that?. END
BEGIN NOW Sometimes killing is necessary. END
BEGIN NOW But to kill on a whim?. END
BEGIN NOW The order is unreasonable. END
BEGIN NOW I must refuse. END
BEGIN NOW Lord Kurogane, at the second castle there is a supply of salt. END
BEGIN NOW Why?. END
BEGIN NOW When you bring back her head, salt it first. END
BEGIN NOW Otherwise, in this heat, we'll be unable to look at it. END
BEGIN NOW Lady Sue is so beautiful, it would be ungracious to her. END
BEGIN NOW Since you will go personally, there will be no mistake. END
BEGIN NOW Do it as you see fit. END
BEGIN NOW Why stay with this mad old man?. END
BEGIN NOW If the rock you sit on starts to roll, jump clear. END
BEGIN NOW Or you'll go with it and be squashed. END
BEGIN NOW Only a fool stays aboard. END
BEGIN NOW Where am l?. END
BEGIN NOW What is this place?. END
BEGIN NOW Paradise! END
BEGIN NOW Think of it. END
BEGIN NOW All my life, I've been his nurse. END
BEGIN NOW Good boy. END
BEGIN NOW Sweet dreams. END
BEGIN NOW I, Kurogane, am back! END
BEGIN NOW Approach. END
BEGIN NOW Thank you for being quick. END
BEGIN NOW At your service, My Lady. END
BEGIN NOW I have brought the object, as per your instructions. END
BEGIN NOW Be so kind as to examine it. END
BEGIN NOW I'll be the first to look. END
BEGIN NOW What is this?. END
BEGIN NOW Your joking goes too far! END
BEGIN NOW Is anything wrong?. END
BEGIN NOW Imagine that! END
BEGIN NOW Lady Sue was a fox in disguise. END
BEGIN NOW Enough of your tricks! END
BEGIN NOW This is a statue from a shrine. END
BEGIN NOW Clever fox... First becomes human then turns himself to stone. END
BEGIN NOW Are you making a fool of me?. END
BEGIN NOW Certainly not. END
BEGIN NOW There are many foxes hereabouts. END
BEGIN NOW It's said they take human form. END
BEGIN NOW Take care, My Lord. END
BEGIN NOW They often impersonate women. END
BEGIN NOW In Central Asia a fox seduced King Pan Tsu, and made him kill , men. END
BEGIN NOW In China he married King Yu and ravaged the land. END
BEGIN NOW In Japan, as Princess Tamamo, he caused great havoc at court. END
BEGIN NOW He became a white fox with nine tails. END
BEGIN NOW Then they lost trace of him. END
BEGIN NOW Some people say he settled down here. END
BEGIN NOW So beware, My Lord, beware. END
BEGIN NOW This is how you keep our bargain! END
BEGIN NOW You conspire with Kurogane to humiliate me. END
BEGIN NOW No, you're wrong. END
BEGIN NOW Intolerable! END
BEGIN NOW It's Kurogane's doing! END
BEGIN NOW Always Kurogane! END
BEGIN NOW Is he your only vassal?. END
BEGIN NOW He's the villain who killed Taro. END
BEGIN NOW He's the hero who saved Sue. END
BEGIN NOW A two-headed monster. END
BEGIN NOW This is your right arm ?. END
BEGIN NOW Until the day I have Sue's head, you shall not see me again. END
BEGIN NOW Sister, my flute! END
BEGIN NOW We've no time to get it. END
BEGIN NOW I've had it since boyhood. END
BEGIN NOW What shall we do?. END
BEGIN NOW Kurogane said they'll pursue you. END
BEGIN NOW I'll go back for the flute. END
BEGIN NOW Your legs are old. END
BEGIN NOW I'm the one to go. END
BEGIN NOW We're near the ruins of your castle. END
BEGIN NOW Go there and pray for your dead. END
BEGIN NOW You may never be back again. END
BEGIN NOW Tsurumaru, let's hurry! END
BEGIN NOW I see our castle. END
BEGIN NOW That is, what's left of it. END
BEGIN NOW Which way, sister?. END
BEGIN NOW Over there. END
BEGIN NOW Where?. END
BEGIN NOW Earth and sky are topsy-turvy. END
BEGIN NOW I was the fool and made him laugh. END
BEGIN NOW Now the coin is flipped. END
BEGIN NOW Don't be mute, say something! END
BEGIN NOW You speak nonsense, I'll speak truth. END
BEGIN NOW We'll see what comes of it. END
BEGIN NOW Begin, old man. END
BEGIN NOW A serpent's egg is white and pure. END
BEGIN NOW A bird's is speckled and soiled. END
BEGIN NOW This is a castle... END
BEGIN NOW Here's a wall. END
BEGIN NOW The bird left the speckled egg for the white. END
BEGIN NOW Strange... END
BEGIN NOW The egg cracks, out comes a snake. END
BEGIN NOW Empty space above the wall. END
BEGIN NOW Why?. END
BEGIN NOW The bird is gobbled by the snake. END
BEGIN NOW Where am l?. END
BEGIN NOW Who am l?. END
BEGIN NOW Stupid bird! END
BEGIN NOW Saburo... END
BEGIN NOW It hurts. END
BEGIN NOW I'm aworm, don't crush me! END
BEGIN NOW Who'd bother to crush a worm?. END
BEGIN NOW Who are you?. END
BEGIN NOW Is someone crying?. END
BEGIN NOW Who's crying?. END
BEGIN NOW Hell! END
BEGIN NOW Man is born crying. END
BEGIN NOW When he's cried enough, he dies. END
BEGIN NOW Saburo has crossed the river. END
BEGIN NOW He's now in Hachiman Field! END
BEGIN NOW What can he do with so few men?. END
BEGIN NOW Message from Lord Saburo. END
BEGIN NOW Speak. END
BEGIN NOW He is here to find his father. END
BEGIN NOW That done, he will leave in peace. END
BEGIN NOW Fujimaki is at the border. END
BEGIN NOW I don't like it. END
BEGIN NOW I didn't want reinforcements. END
BEGIN NOW You should be glad. END
BEGIN NOW Thanks to Fujimaki, the enemy is pinned down here. END
BEGIN NOW We can rescue your father from Azusa Plain. END
BEGIN NOW But it looks so aggressive. END
BEGIN NOW One false move could mean war. END
BEGIN NOW Maybe I was too hasty. END
BEGIN NOW My worry spurred me on but my son-in-law will grumble. END
BEGIN NOW Sitting here, we pose no threat. END
BEGIN NOW Prepare for battle! END
BEGIN NOW My Lord, this is ill-advised. END
BEGIN NOW Let Saburo have his father. END
BEGIN NOW Avoid this war. END
BEGIN NOW Once he has Father, he'll accuse me of treason and attack. END
BEGIN NOW We can't give up Hidetora, we don't know where he is. END
BEGIN NOW There is much unrest in the land. END
BEGIN NOW Fujimaki and Ayabe bide their time. END
BEGIN NOW We need to retrench, not attack. END
BEGIN NOW A message! END
BEGIN NOW Lady Kaede awaits Lord Jiro, to celebrate his departure for battle. END
BEGIN NOW A warlord doesn't run to his woman. END
BEGIN NOW Stay away! END
BEGIN NOW When the enemy is assembled we can go after His Lordship. END
BEGIN NOW Be patient! END
BEGIN NOW Rest the horses. END
BEGIN NOW Dismount! END
BEGIN NOW Weakling! END
BEGIN NOW Kurogane has swayed you again. END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW It's no time for war. END
BEGIN NOW Wars are won by strong leaders. END
BEGIN NOW Why fear Fujimaki and Ayabe?. END
BEGIN NOW Your mistake was to spare Hidetora, mad or not. END
BEGIN NOW To kill him I have to find him. END
BEGIN NOW Saburo knows where he is. END
BEGIN NOW Otherwise he wouldn't have come. END
BEGIN NOW Send him a message. END
BEGIN NOW Say he can have his father. END
BEGIN NOW Watch his movements and send out your assassins. END
BEGIN NOW I'm lost. END
BEGIN NOW Such is the human condition. END
BEGIN NOW This path... END
BEGIN NOW I remember... We came this way before. END
BEGIN NOW Men always travel the same road. END
BEGIN NOW If you're tired of it, jump! END
BEGIN NOW Up there. END
BEGIN NOW Who is it?. END
BEGIN NOW Sue! END
BEGIN NOW Sister, that voice... END
BEGIN NOW This ruin was once a castle. END
BEGIN NOW It belonged to Sue's father. END
BEGIN NOW I destroyed it. END
BEGIN NOW Why am I here?. END
BEGIN NOW Why is Sue here?. END
BEGIN NOW And Tsurumaru too?. END
BEGIN NOW Is this a dream?. END
BEGIN NOW No, this is hell. END
BEGIN NOW Hell. END
BEGIN NOW The lowest level of hell. END
BEGIN NOW Mount! END
BEGIN NOW Message from Lord Jiro! END
BEGIN NOW Very good. END
BEGIN NOW He says he won't attack. END
BEGIN NOW We're to leave once we have Father. END
BEGIN NOW Let's go at once. END
BEGIN NOW We'd give away his wheareabouts. END
BEGIN NOW Wait till dark. END
BEGIN NOW Ayabe is on the move. END
BEGIN NOW Vulture! END
BEGIN NOW He smells blood. END
BEGIN NOW Stay calm, My Lord. END
BEGIN NOW Ayabe is watching. END

BEGIN NOW Once upon a time there lived a king who had two daughters, and he loved them with all his heart. END
BEGIN NOW When they grew up, he was suddenly seized with a wish to know if they, on their part, truly loved him, and he made up his mind that he would give his kingdom to whichever best proved her devotion. END
BEGIN NOW So he called the elder princess and said to her, How much do you love me? END
BEGIN NOW As the apple of my eye! END
BEGIN NOW answered she. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW exclaimed the king, kissing her tenderly as he spoke, you are indeed a good daughter. END
BEGIN NOW Then he sent for the younger, and asked her how much she loved him. END
BEGIN NOW I look upon you, my father, she answered, as I look upon salt in my food. END
BEGIN NOW But the king did not like her words, and ordered her to quit the court, and never again to appear before him. END
BEGIN NOW The poor princess went sadly up to her room and began to cry, but when she was reminded of her father's commands, she dried her eyes, and made a bundle of her jewels and her best dresses and hurriedly left the castle where she was born. END
BEGIN NOW She walked straight along the road in front of her, without knowing very well where she was going or what was to become of her, for she had never been shown how to work, and all she had learnt consisted of a few household rules, and receipts of dishes which her mother had taught her long ago. END
BEGIN NOW And as she was afraid that no housewife would want to engage a girl with such a pretty face, she determined to make herself as ugly as she could. END
BEGIN NOW She therefore took off the dress that she was wearing and put on some horrible old rags belonging to a beggar, all torn and covered with mud. END
BEGIN NOW After that she smeared mud all over her hands and face, and shook her hair into a great tangle. END
BEGIN NOW Having thus changed her-appearance, she went about offering herself as a goose-girl or shepherdess. END
BEGIN NOW But the farmers' wives would have nothing to say to such a dirty maiden, and sent her away with a morsel of bread for charity's sake. END
BEGIN NOW After walking for a great many days without being able to find any work, she came to a large farm where they were in want of a shepherdess, and engaged her gladly. END
BEGIN NOW One day when she was keeping her sheep in a lonely tract of land, she suddenly felt a wish to dress herself in her robes of splendor. END
BEGIN NOW She washed herself carefully in the stream, and as she always carried her bundle with her, it was easy to shake off her rags, and transform herself in a few moments into a great lady. END
BEGIN NOW The king's son, who had lost his way out hunting, perceived this lovely damsel a long way off, and wished to look at her closer. END
BEGIN NOW But as soon as the girl saw what he was at, she fled into the wood as swiftly as a bird. END
BEGIN NOW The prince ran after her, but as he was running he caught his foot in the root of a tree and fell, and when he got up again, she was nowhere to be seen. END
BEGIN NOW When she was quite safe, she put on her rags again, and smeared over her face and hands. END
BEGIN NOW However the young prince, who was both hot and thirsty, found his way to the farm, to ask for a drink of cider, and he inquired the name of the beautiful lady that kept the sheep. END
BEGIN NOW At this everyone began to laugh, for they said that the shepherdess was one of the ugliest and dirtiest creatures under the sun. END
BEGIN NOW The prince thought some witchcraft must be at work, and he hastened away before the return of the shepherdess, who became that evening the butt of everybody's jests. END
BEGIN NOW But the king's son thought often of the lovely maiden whom he had only seen for a moment, though she seemed to him much more fascinating than any lady of the court. END
BEGIN NOW At last he dreamed of nothing else, and grew thinner day by day till his parents inquired what was the matter, promising to do all they could to make him as happy as he once was. END
BEGIN NOW He dared not tell them the truth, lest they should laugh at him, so he only said that he should like some bread baked by the kitchen girl in the distant farm. END
BEGIN NOW Although the wish appeared rather odd, they hastened to fulfill it, and the farmer was told the request of the king's son. END
BEGIN NOW The maiden showed no surprise at receiving such an order, but merely asked for some flour, salt, and water, and also that she might be left alone in a little room adjoining the oven, where the kneading-trough stood. END
BEGIN NOW Before beginning her work she washed herself carefully, and even put on her rings; but, while she was baking, one of her rings slid into the dough. END
BEGIN NOW When she had finished she dirtied herself again, and let lumps of the dough stick to her fingers, so that she became as ugly as before. END
BEGIN NOW The loaf, which was a very little one, was brought to the king's son, who ate it with pleasure. END
BEGIN NOW But in cutting it he found the ring of the princess, and declared to his parents that he would marry the girl whom that ring fitted. END
BEGIN NOW So the king made a proclamation through his whole kingdom, and ladies came from afar to lay claim to the honor. END
BEGIN NOW But the ring was so tiny that even those who had the smallest hands could only get it on their little fingers. END
BEGIN NOW In a short time all the maidens of the kingdom, including the peasant girls, had tried on the ring, and the king was just about to announce that their efforts had been in vain, when the prince observed that he had not yet seen the shepherdess. END
BEGIN NOW They sent to fetch her, and she arrived covered with rags, but with her hands cleaner than usual, so that she could easily slip on the ring. END
BEGIN NOW The king's son declared that he would fulfill his promise, and when his parents mildly remarked that the girl was only a keeper of sheep, and a very ugly one too, the maiden boldly said that she was born a princess, and that, if they would only give her some water and leave her alone in a room for a few minutes, she would show that she could look as well as anyone in fine clothes. END
BEGIN NOW They did what she asked, and when she entered in a magnificent dress, she looked so beautiful that all saw she must be a princess in disguise. END
BEGIN NOW The king's son recognized the charming damsel of whom he had once caught a glimpse, and, flinging himself at her feet, asked if she would marry him. END
BEGIN NOW The princess then told her story, and said that it would be necessary to send an ambassador to her father to ask his consent and to invite him to the wedding. END
BEGIN NOW The princess's father, who had never ceased to repent his harshness towards his daughter, had sought her through the land, but as no one could tell him anything of her, he supposed her dead. END
BEGIN NOW Therefore it was with great joy he heard that she was living and that a king's son asked her in marriage, and he quitted his kingdom with his elder daughter so as to be present at the ceremony. END
BEGIN NOW By the orders of the bride, they only served her father at the wedding breakfast bread without salt, and meat without seasoning. END
BEGIN NOW Seeing him make faces, and eat very little, his daughter, who sat beside him, inquired if his dinner was not to his taste. END
BEGIN NOW No, he replied, the dishes are carefully cooked and sent up, but they are all so dreadfully tasteless. END
BEGIN NOW Did not I tell you, my father, that salt was the best thing in life? END
BEGIN NOW And yet, when I compared you to salt, to show how much I loved you, you thought slightingly of me and you chased me from your presence. END
BEGIN NOW The king embraced his daughter, and allowed that he had been wrong to misinterpret her words. END
BEGIN NOW Then, for the rest of the wedding feast they gave him bread made with salt, and dishes with seasoning, and he said they were the very best he had ever eaten.  END
BEGIN NOW Once upon a time there was a father who had two daughters. END
BEGIN NOW Calling them to him one day he said to them, What is the sweetest thing in the world? END
BEGIN NOW Sugar, said the elder daughter. END
BEGIN NOW Salt, said the younger. END
BEGIN NOW The father was angry at this last answer. END
BEGIN NOW But his daughter stuck to it, and so her father said to her, I won't keep a daughter in my house who believes that salt is the sweetest thing in the world. END
BEGIN NOW You must leave me and seek another home. END
BEGIN NOW So the younger daughter left her father's house and wandered here and there, suffering much hunger and cold, until t last she was befriended by the fairies. END
BEGIN NOW As she walked through a wood one day listening to the songs of the birds, a prince came hunting for deer, and when he saw her he fell in love with her at once. END
BEGIN NOW She agreed to marry him, and a great banquet was prepared at the prince's house. END
BEGIN NOW To this banquet the bride's father was bidden; but he did not know that the bride was his own daughter. END
BEGIN NOW Now, at the wish of the bride, all the dishes were prepared without salt. END
BEGIN NOW So when the guests began to eat they found that the food was tasteless. END
BEGIN NOW At last one of them said, There is no salt in the meat! END
BEGIN NOW And then all the guests said, There is no salt in the meat! END
BEGIN NOW And the bride's father spoke the loudest of all. END
BEGIN NOW Truly, salt is the sweetest thing in the world, he said, though, for saying so, I sent my own daughter away from my house, and shall never see her face again. END
BEGIN NOW Then the bride made herself known to her father, and fell on his neck and kissed him.  END
BEGIN NOW  Thou Nature art my Goddess, to thy Law My Services are bound, why am I then Depriv'd of a Son's Right because I came not In the dull Road that custom has prescrib'd? END

BEGIN NOW why are we Held Base, who in the lusty stealth of Nature Take fiercer Qualities than what compound The scanted Births of the stale Marriage-bed? END
BEGIN NOW Well then, legitimate Edgar, to thy right Of Law I will oppose a Bastard's Cunning. END
BEGIN NOW Our Father's Love is to the Bastard Edmund As to Legitimate Edgar: with success I've practis'd yet on both their easie Natures: Here comes the old Man chaf't with th' Information Which last I forg'd against my Brother Edgar, A Tale so plausible, so boldly utter'd And heightned by such lucky Accidents, That now the slightest circumstance confirms him, And Base-born Edmund spight of Law inherits. END

BEGIN NOW Be not too rash, all may be forgery, And time yet clear the Duty of your Son. END
BEGIN NOW Plead with the Seas, and reason down the Winds, Yet shalt thou ne're convince me, I have seen His foul Designs through all a Father's fondness: But be this Light and Thou my Witnesses That I discard him here from my Possessions, Divorce him from my Heart, my Blood and Name. END
BEGIN NOW It works as I cou'd wish; I'll shew my self. END
BEGIN NOW Ha Edmund! END
BEGIN NOW welcome Boy; O Kent see here Inverted Nature, Gloster's Shame and Glory, This By-born, the wild sally of my Youth, Pursues me with all filial Offices, Whilst Edgar, begg'd of Heaven and born in Honour, Draws plagues on my white head that urge me still To curse in Age the pleasure of my Youth. END
BEGIN NOW Nay weep not, Edmund, for thy Brother's crimes; O gen'rous Boy, thou shar'st but half his blood, Yet lov'st beyond the kindness of a Brother. END
BEGIN NOW But I'll reward thy Vertue. END
BEGIN NOW Follow me. END
BEGIN NOW My Lord, you wait the King who comes resolv'd To quit the Toils of Empire, and divide His Realms amongst his Daughters, Heaven succeed it, But much I fear the Change. END
BEGIN NOW I grieve to see him With such wild starts of passion hourly seiz'd, As renders Majesty beneath it self. END
BEGIN NOW Alas! END

BEGIN NOW We do, my Liege. END
BEGIN NOW Give me the Mapp — know, Lords, We have divided In Three our Kingdom, having now resolved To disengage from Our long Toil of State, Conferring All upon your younger years; You, Burgundy, Cornwall and Albany Long in Our Court have made your amorous sojourn And now are to be answer'd — tell me my Daughters Which of you Loves Us most, that We may place Our largest Bounty with the largest Merit. END
BEGIN NOW Sir, I do love You more than words can utter, Beyond what can be valu'd, Rich or Rare, Nor Liberty, nor Sight, Health, Fame, or Beauty Are half so dear, my Life for you were vile, As much as Child can love the best of Fathers. END
BEGIN NOW Of all these Bounds, ev'n from this Line to this With shady Forests and wide-skirted Meads, We make Thee Lady, to thine and Albany's Issue Be this perpetual — What says Our Second Daughter? END

BEGIN NOW Therefore to thee and thine Hereditary Remain this ample Third of our fair Kingdom. END
BEGIN NOW Now comes my Trial, how am I distrest, [Aside. END
BEGIN NOW That must with cold speech tempt the chol'rick King Rather to leave me Dowerless, than condemn me To loath'd Embraces! END
BEGIN NOW Speak now Our last, not least in Our dear Love, So ends my Task of State, — Cordelia speak, What canst Thou say to win a richer Third Than what thy Sisters gain'd? END
BEGIN NOW Now must my Love in words fall short of theirs As much as it exceeds in Truth — Nothing my Lord. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing can come of Nothing, speak agen. END
BEGIN NOW Unhappy am I that I can't dissemble, Sir, as I ought, I love your Majesty, No more nor less. END

BEGIN NOW Happ'ly when I shall Wed, the Lord whose Hand Shall take my Plight, will carry half my Love, For I shall never marry, like my Sisters, To Love my Father All. END
BEGIN NOW And goes thy Heart with this? END
BEGIN NOW 'Tis said that I am Chol'rick, judge me Gods, Is there not cause? END
BEGIN NOW now Minion I perceive The Truth of what has been suggested to Us, Thy Fondness for the Rebel Son of Gloster, False to his Father, as Thou art to my Hopes: And oh take heed, rash Girl, lest We comply With thy fond wishes, which thou wilt too late Repent, for know Our nature cannot brook A Child so young and so Ungentle. END
BEGIN NOW So young my Lord and True. END
BEGIN NOW Thy Truth then be thy Dow'r, For by the sacred Sun and solemn Night I here disclaim all my paternal Care, And from this minute hold thee as a Stranger Both to my Blood and Favour. END

BEGIN NOW Hear me rash Man, on thy Allegiance hear me; Since thou hast striv'n to make Us break our Vow And prest between our Sentence and our Pow'r, Which nor our Nature nor our Place can bear, We banish thee for ever from our Sight And Kingdom; if when Three days are expir'd Thy hated Trunk be found in our Dominions That moment is thy Death; Away.

BEGIN NOW Why fare thee well, King, since thou art resolv'd, I take thee at thy word, and will not stay To see thy Fall: the gods protect the Maid That truly thinks, and has most justly said. END
BEGIN NOW Thus to new Climates my old Truth I bear, Friendship lives Hence, and Banishment is Here. END
BEGIN NOW [Exit. END
BEGIN NOW Now Burgundy, you see her Price is faln, Yet if the fondness of your Passion still Affects her as she stands, Dow'rless, and lost In our Esteem, she's yours, take her or leave her. END
BEGIN NOW Pardon me, Royal Lear, I but demand The Dow'r your Self propos'd, and here I take Cordelia by the Hand Dutchess of Burgundy. END
BEGIN NOW Then leave her Sir, for by a Father's rage I tell you all her Wealth. END
BEGIN NOW Away. END
BEGIN NOW Then Sir be pleas'd to charge the breach Of our Alliance on your own Will Not my Inconstancy. END
BEGIN NOW [ Manent Edgar and Cordelia. END
BEGIN NOW Has Heaven then weigh'd the merit of my Love, Or is't the raving of my sickly Thought? END
BEGIN NOW Cou'd Burgundy forgoe so rich a Prize And leave her to despairing Edgar's Arms? END
BEGIN NOW Have I thy Hand Cordelia, do I clasp it, The Hand that was this minute to have join'd My hated Rivals? END
BEGIN NOW do I kneel before thee And offer at thy feet my panting Heart? END
BEGIN NOW Smile, Princess, and convince me, for as yet I doubt, and dare not trust the dazling Joy. END
BEGIN NOW Some Comfort yet that 'twas no vicious Blot That has depriv'd me of a Father's Grace, But meerly want of that that makes me rich In wanting it, a smooth professing Tongue: O Sisters, I am loth to call your fault As it deserves; but use our Father well, And wrong'd Cordelia never shall repine. END
BEGIN NOW O heav'nly Maid that art thy self thy Dow'r, Richer in Vertue than the Stars in Light, If Edgar's humble fortunes may be grac't With thy Acceptance, at thy feet he lays 'em. END
BEGIN NOW Ha my Cordelia! END
BEGIN NOW dost thou turn away? END
BEGIN NOW What have I done t'offend Thee? END
BEGIN NOW Talk't of Love. END
BEGIN NOW Then I've offended oft, Cordelia too Has oft permitted me so to offend. END
BEGIN NOW When, Edgar, I permitted your Addresses, I was the darling Daughter of a King, Nor can I now forget my royal Birth, And live dependent on my Lover's Fortune. END
BEGIN NOW I cannot to so low a fate submit, And therefore study to forget your Passion, And trouble me upon this Theam no more. END
BEGIN NOW Thus Majesty takes most State in Distress! END
BEGIN NOW How are we tost on Fortune's fickle flood! END
BEGIN NOW The Wave that with surprising kindness brought The dear Wreck to my Arms, has snatcht it back, And left me mourning on the barren Shore. END
BEGIN NOW This Baseness of th' ignoble Burgundy [Aside. END
BEGIN NOW Draws just suspicion on the Race of Men, His Love was Int'rest, so may Edgar's be And He but with more Complement dissemble; If so, I shall oblige him by Denying: But if his Love be fixt, such Constant flame As warms our Breasts, if such I find his Passion, My Heart as gratefull to his Truth shall be, And Cold Cordelia prove as Kind as He.

BEGIN NOW but oh! END
BEGIN NOW more Cruel! END
BEGIN NOW Hear me Sir, your Life, your Life's in Danger. END
BEGIN NOW A Resolve so sudden And of such black Importance! END
BEGIN NOW 'Twas not sudden, Some Villain has of long time laid the Train. END
BEGIN NOW And yet perhaps 'twas but pretended Coldness, To try how far my passion would pursue. END
BEGIN NOW He hears me not; wake, wake Sir. END
BEGIN NOW Say ye Brother? END
BEGIN NOW — No Tears good Edmund, if thou bringst me tidings To strike me dead, for Charity delay not, That present will befit so kind a Hand. END
BEGIN NOW Your danger Sir comes on so fast That I want time t'inform you, but retire Whilst I take care to turn the pressing Stream. END
BEGIN NOW O gods! END
BEGIN NOW for Heav'ns sake Sir. END
BEGIN NOW Pardon me Sir, a serious Thought Had seiz'd me, but I think you talkt of danger And wisht me to Retire; must all our Vows End thus! END
BEGIN NOW — Friend I obey you — O Cordelia! END
BEGIN NOW [Exit. END
BEGIN NOW Ha! END
BEGIN NOW ha! END
BEGIN NOW fond Man, such credulous Honesty Lessens the Glory of my Artifice, His Nature is so far from doing wrongs That he suspects none: if this Letter speed And pass for Edgar's, as himself wou'd own The Counterfeit but for the foul Contents, Then my designs are perfect — here comes Gloster. END
BEGIN NOW [Enter Gloster. END
BEGIN NOW Stay Edmund, turn, what paper were you reading? END
BEGIN NOW A Trifle Sir. END
BEGIN NOW What needed then that terrible dispatch of it Into your Pocket, come produce it Sir. END
BEGIN NOW A Letter from my Brother Sir, I had Just broke the Seal but knew not the Contents, Yet fearing they might prove to blame Endeavour'd to conceal it from your sight. END
BEGIN NOW 'Tis Edgar's Character. END
BEGIN NOW [Reads. END
BEGIN NOW This Policy of Fathers is intollerable that keeps our Fortunes from us till Age will not suffer us to enjoy 'em; I am weary of the Tyranny: Come to me that of this I may speak more: if our Father would sleep till I wak't him, you shou'd enjoy half his Possessions, and live beloved of your Brother Slept till I wake him, you shou'd enjoy Half his possessions — Edgar to write this 'Gainst his indulgent Father! END
BEGIN NOW Death and Hell! END
BEGIN NOW Fly, Edmund, seek him out, wind me into him That I may bite the Traytor's heart, and fold His bleeding Entrals on my vengefull Arm. END
BEGIN NOW Perhaps 'twas writ, my Lord, to prove my Vertue. END
BEGIN NOW These late Eclipses of the Sun and Moon Can bode no less; Love cools, and friendship fails, In Cities mutiny, in Countrys discord, The bond of Nature crack't 'twixt Son and Father: Find out the Villain, do it carefully And it shall lose thee nothing. END
BEGIN NOW [Exit. END
BEGIN NOW So, now my project's firm, but to make sure I'll throw in one proof more and that a bold one; I'll place old Gloster where he shall o're-hear us Confer of this design, whilst to his thinking, Deluded Edgar shall accuse himself. END
BEGIN NOW Be Honesty my Int'rest and I can Be honest too, and what Saint so Divine That will successfull Villany decline! END
BEGIN NOW [Exit. END
BEGIN NOW Enter Kent disguis'd. END
BEGIN NOW Now banisht Kent, if thou canst pay thy duty In this disguise where thou dost stand condemn'd, Thy Master Lear shall find thee full of Labours. END
BEGIN NOW In there, and tell our Daughter we are here Now; What art Thou? END
BEGIN NOW A Man, Sir. END
BEGIN NOW What dost thou profess, or wou'dst with us? END
BEGIN NOW I do profess to be no less then I seem, to serve him truly that puts me in Trust, to love him that's Honest, to converse with him that's wise and speaks little, to fight when I can't choose; and to eat no Fish. END
BEGIN NOW I say, what art Thou? END
BEGIN NOW A very honest-hearted fellow, and as poor as the King. END
BEGIN NOW Then art thou poor indeed — What can'st thou do? END

BEGIN NOW Now, Daughter, why that frontlet on? END
BEGIN NOW Speak, do's that Frown become our Presence? END
BEGIN NOW Sir, this licentious Insolence of your Servants Is most unseemly, hourly they break out In quarrels bred by their unbounded Riots, I had fair hope by making this known to you T'have had a quick Redress, but find too late That you protect and countenance their out-rage; And therefore, Sir, I take this freedom, which Necessity makes Discreet.

BEGIN NOW He did betray his Practice, and receiv'd The Hurt you see, striving to apprehend him. END
BEGIN NOW Is He pursu'd? END
BEGIN NOW He is, my Lord. END
BEGIN NOW Use our Authority to apprehend The Traytour and do Justice on his Head; For you, Edmund, that have so signaliz'd Your Vertue, you from henceforth shall be ours; Natures of such firm Trust we much shall need. END

BEGIN NOW Now, what's the matter? END
BEGIN NOW Keep peace upon your Lives, he dies that strikes. END
BEGIN NOW Whence and what are ye? END
BEGIN NOW Sir, they are Messengers, the one from your Sister, The other from the King. END
BEGIN NOW Your Difference? END
BEGIN NOW speak. END
BEGIN NOW I'm scarce in breath, my Lord. END
BEGIN NOW No marvel, you have so bestirr'd your Valour. END
BEGIN NOW Nature disclaims the Dastard, a Taylor made him. END
BEGIN NOW Speak yet, how grew your Quarrel? END
BEGIN NOW Sir this old Ruffian here, whose Life I spar'd In pity to his Beard — Thou Essence Bottle! END
BEGIN NOW In pity to my Beard? END
BEGIN NOW — Your leave, my Lord, And I will tread the Muss cat into Mortar. END
BEGIN NOW Know'st thou our Presence? END
BEGIN NOW Yes, Sir, but Anger has a Privilege. END
BEGIN NOW Why art thou angry? END
BEGIN NOW That such a Slave as this shou'd wear a Sword And have no Courage, Office and no Honesty. END
BEGIN NOW Not Frost and Fire hold more Antipathy Than I and such a Knave. END
BEGIN NOW Why dost thou call him Knave? END
BEGIN NOW His Countenance likes me not. END
BEGIN NOW No more perhaps does Mine, nor His or Hers. END
BEGIN NOW Plain-dealing is my Trade, and to be plain, Sir, I have seen better Faces in my time Than stands on any Shoulders now before me. END
BEGIN NOW This is some Fellow that having once been prais'd, For Bluntness, since affects a sawcy Rudeness, But I have known one of these surly Knaves That in his Plainness harbour'd more Design Than twenty cringing complementing Minions. END
BEGIN NOW What's the offence you gave him? END
BEGIN NOW Never any, Sir. END
BEGIN NOW It pleas'd the King his Master lately To strike me on a slender misconstruction, Whilst watching his Advantage this old Lurcher Tript me behind, for which the King extold him; And, flusht with th' honour of this bold exploit, Drew on me here agen. END
BEGIN NOW Bring forth the Stocks, we'll teach you. END
BEGIN NOW Sir I'm too old to learn; Call not the Stocks for me, I serve the King, On whose Employment I was sent to you, You'll shew too small Respect, and too bold Malice Against the Person of my royal Master, Stocking his Messenger. END
BEGIN NOW Bring forth the Stocks, as I have Life and Honour, There shall he sit till Noon. END
BEGIN NOW Till Noon, my Lord? END
BEGIN NOW till Night, and all Night too. END
BEGIN NOW Why, Madam, if I were your Father's Dog You wou'd not use me so. END
BEGIN NOW Sir, being his Knave I will. END
BEGIN NOW Let me beseech your Graces to forbear him, His fault is much, and the good King his Master Will check him for't, but needs must take it ill To be thus slighted in his Messenger. END
BEGIN NOW Wee'l answer that; Our Sister may receive it worse to have Her Gentleman assaulted: to our business lead. END
BEGIN NOW [Exit. END
BEGIN NOW I am sorry for thee, Friend, 'tis the Duke's pleasure Whose Disposition will not be controll'd, But I'll entreat for thee. END
BEGIN NOW Pray do not, Sir — I have watcht and travell'd hard, Some time I shall sleep out, the rest I'll whistle: Fare-well t'ye, Sir. END
BEGIN NOW [Ex. END
BEGIN NOW All weary and o're-watcht, I feel the drowzy Guest steal on me; take Advantage heavy Eyes of this kind Slumber, Not to behold this vile and shamefull Lodging. END
BEGIN NOW [Sleeps. END
BEGIN NOW Enter I heard my self proclaim'd, And by the friendly Hollow of a Tree Escapt the Hunt, no Port is free, no place Where Guards and most unusual Vigilance Do not attend to take me — how easie now 'Twere to defeat the malice of my Trale, And leave my Griefs on my Sword's reeking point; But Love detains me from Death's peacefull Cell, Still whispering me Cordelia's in distress; Unkinde as she is I cannot see her wretched, But must be neer to wait upon her Fortune. END
BEGIN NOW Who knows but the white minute yet may come When Edgar may do service to Cordelia, That charming Hope still ties me to the Oar Of painfull Life, and makes me too, submit To th' humblest shifts to keep that Life a foot; My Face I will besmear and knit my Locks, The Country gives me proof and president Of Bedlam Beggars, who with roaring Voices Strike in their numm'd and mortify'd bare Arms Pins, Iron-spikes, Thorns, sprigs of Rosemary, And thus from Sheep-coats Villages and Mills, Sometimes with Prayers, sometimes with Lunatick Banns Enforce their Charity, poor Tyrligod, poor Tom That's something yet, Edgar I am no more.

BEGIN NOW [Exit Kent in the Stocks still; Enter Lear attended. END
BEGIN NOW 'Tis strange that they shou'd so depart from home And not send back our Messenger. END
BEGIN NOW Hail, noble Master. END
BEGIN NOW How? END
BEGIN NOW mak'st thou this Shame thy Pastime? END
BEGIN NOW What's he that has so much mistook thy Place To set thee here? END
BEGIN NOW It is both He and She, Sir, your Son and Daughter. END
BEGIN NOW No. END
BEGIN NOW Yes: No I say. END
BEGIN NOW I say yea: By Jupiter I swear no. END
BEGIN NOW By Juno I swear, I swear I. END
BEGIN NOW They durst not do't They cou'd not, wou'd not do't, 'tis worse then Murder To doe upon Respect such violent out-rage. END
BEGIN NOW Resolve me with all modest haste which way Thou mayst deserve, or they impose this usage? END
BEGIN NOW My Lord, when at their Home I did commend your Highness Letters to them, E'er I was Ris'n, arriv'd another Post Steer'd in his haste, breathless and panting forth From Gonerill his Mistress Salutations, Whose Message being deliver'd, they took Horse, Commanding me to follow and attend The leisure of their Answer; which I did, But meeting that other Messenger Whose welcome I perceiv'd had poison'd mine, Being the very Fellow that of late Had shew'n such rudeness to your Highness, I Having more Man than Wit about me, Drew, On which he rais'd the House with Coward cries: This was the Trespass which your Son and Daughter Thought worth the shame you see it suffer here. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW how this Spleen swells upward to my Heart And heaves for passage — down thou climing Rage Thy Element's below; where is this Daughter? END
BEGIN NOW Within, Sir, at a Masque. END
BEGIN NOW Now Gloster? END
BEGIN NOW — ha! END
BEGIN NOW Deny to speak with me? END
BEGIN NOW th'are sick, th'are weary, They have travell'd hard to Night — meer fetches; Bring me a better Answer. END
BEGIN NOW My dear Lord, You know the fiery Quality of the Duke — Vengeance! END
BEGIN NOW Death, Plague, Confusion, Fiery? END
BEGIN NOW what Quality — why Gloster, Gloster, I'd speak with the Duke of Cornwal and his Wife. END
BEGIN NOW I have inform'd 'em so. END
BEGIN NOW Inform'd 'em! END
BEGIN NOW dost thou understand me, Man, I tell thee Gloster — I, my good Lord. END
BEGIN NOW The King wou'd speak with Cornwal, the dear Father Would with his Daughter speak, commands her Service. END
BEGIN NOW Are they inform'd of this? END
BEGIN NOW my Breath and Blood! END
BEGIN NOW Fiery! END
BEGIN NOW the fiery Duke! END
BEGIN NOW tell the hot Duke — No, but not yet, may be he is not well: Infirmity do's still neglect all Office; I beg his Pardon, and I'll chide my Rashness That took the indispos'd and sickly Fit For the sound Man — but wherefore sits he there? END
BEGIN NOW Death on my State, this Act convinces me That this Retiredness of the Duke and her Is plain Contempt; give me my Servant forth, Go tell the Duke and's Wife I'd speak with 'em. END
BEGIN NOW Now, instantly, bid 'em come forth and hear me, Or at their Chamber door I'll beat the Drum Till it cry sleep to Death — Oh! END
BEGIN NOW are ye come? END
BEGIN NOW Health to the King. END
BEGIN NOW I am glad to see your Highness. END
BEGIN NOW Regan, I think you are, I know what cause I have to think so; should'st thou not be glad I wou'd divorce me from thy Mother's Tomb? END
BEGIN NOW Beloved Regan, thou wilt shake to hear What I shall utter: Thou coud'st ne'r ha' thought it, Thy Sister's naught, O Regan, she has ty'd Ingratitude like a keen Vulture here, [Kent here set at liberty. END
BEGIN NOW I scarce can speak to thee. END
BEGIN NOW I pray you, Sir, take patience; I have hope That you know less to value her Desert, Then she to slack her Duty. END
BEGIN NOW Ha! END
BEGIN NOW how's that? END
BEGIN NOW I cannot think my Sister in the least Would fail in her respects, but if perchance She has restrain'd the Riots of your Followers 'Tis on such Grounds, and to such wholsome Ends As clears her from all Blame. END
BEGIN NOW My Curses on her. END
BEGIN NOW O Sir, you are old And shou'd content you to be rul'd and led By some discretion that discerns your State Better than you yourself, therefore, Sir, Return to our Sister, and say you have wrong'd her. END
BEGIN NOW Ha! END
BEGIN NOW ask her Forgiveness? END
BEGIN NOW No, no, 'twas my mistake thou didst not mean so, Dear Daughter, I confess that I am old; Age is unnecessary, but thou art good, And wilt dispense with my Infirmity. END
BEGIN NOW Good Sir, no more of these unsightly passions, Return back to our Sister. END
BEGIN NOW Never, Regan, She has abated me of half of my Train, Lookt black upon me, stabb'd me with her Tongue; All the stor'd Vengeances of Heav'n fall On her Ingratefull Head; strike her young Bones Ye taking Ayrs with Lameness. END
BEGIN NOW O the blest Gods! END
BEGIN NOW Thus will you wish on me When the rash mood — No, Regan, Thou shalt never have my Curse, Thy tender Nature cannot give thee o're To such Impiety; Thou better know'st The Offices of Nature, bond of Child-hood, And dues of Gratitude: Thou bear'st in mind The half o'th' Kingdom which our love conferr'd On thee and thine. END
BEGIN NOW Good Sir, toth' purpose. END
BEGIN NOW Who put my Man i'th' Stocks? END
BEGIN NOW What Trumpet's that? END
BEGIN NOW I know't, my Sister's, this confirms her Letters. END
BEGIN NOW Sir, is your Lady come? END
BEGIN NOW Enter More Torture still? END
BEGIN NOW This is a Slave whose easie borrow'd pride Dwells in the fickle Grace of her he follows; A Fashion-fop that spends the day in Dressing, And all to bear his Ladie's flatt'ring Message, That can deliver with a Grace her Lie, And with as bold a face bring back a greater. END
BEGIN NOW Out Varlet from my sight. END
BEGIN NOW What means your Grace? END
BEGIN NOW Who stockt my Servant? END
BEGIN NOW Regan, I have hope Thou didst not know it. END
BEGIN NOW Enter Who comes here! END
BEGIN NOW oh Heavens! END
BEGIN NOW If you do love Old men, if your sweet sway Allow Obedience; if your selves are Old, Make it your Cause, send down and take my part; Why, Gorgon, dost thou come to haunt me here? END
BEGIN NOW Art not asham'd to look upon this Beard? END
BEGIN NOW Darkness upon my Eyes they play me false, O Regan, wilt thou take her by the Hand? END
BEGIN NOW Why not by th' Hand, Sir, how have I offended? END
BEGIN NOW All's not Offence that indiscretion finds, And Dotage terms so. END
BEGIN NOW Heart thou art too tough. END
BEGIN NOW I pray you, Sir, being old confess you are so, If till the expiration of your Month You will return and sojourn with your Sister, Dismissing half your Train, come then to me, I am now from Home, and out of that Provision That shall be needfull for your Entertainment. END
BEGIN NOW Return with her and fifty Knights dismist? END
BEGIN NOW No, rather I'll forswear all Roofs, and chuse To be Companion to the Midnight Wolf, My naked Head expos'd to th' merciless Air Then have my smallest wants suppli'd by her. END
BEGIN NOW At your choice, Sir. END
BEGIN NOW Now I prithee Daughter do not make me mad; I will not trouble thee, my Child, farewell, Wee'l meet no more, no more see one another; Let shame come when it will, I do not call it, I do not bid the Thunder-bearer strike, Nor tell Tales of thee to avenging Heav'n; Mend when thou canst, be better at thy leisure, I can be patient, I can stay with Regan, I, and my hundred Knights.

BEGIN NOW Your Pardon, Sir. END
BEGIN NOW I lookt not for you yet, nor am provided For your fit welcome. END
BEGIN NOW Is this well spoken now? END
BEGIN NOW My Sister treats you fair; what fifty Followers Is it not well? END
BEGIN NOW what shou'd you need of more? END
BEGIN NOW Why might not you, my Lord, receive Attendance From those whom she calls Servants, or from mine? END
BEGIN NOW Why not, my Lord? END
BEGIN NOW if then they chance to slack you We cou'd controll 'em — if you come to me, For now I see the Danger, I entreat you To bring but Five and Twenty; to no more Will I give place. END
BEGIN NOW Hold now my Temper, stand this bolt unmov'd And I am Thunder-proof; The wicked when compar'd with the more wicked Seem beautifull, and not to be the worst, Stands in some rank of Praise; now, Gonerill, Thou art innocent agen, I'll go with thee; Thy Fifty yet, do's double Five and Twenty, And thou art twice her Love. END
BEGIN NOW Hear me, my Lord, What need you Five and Twenty, Ten, or Five, To follow in a House where twice so many Have a Command t'attend you? END
BEGIN NOW What need one? END
BEGIN NOW Blood, Fire! END
BEGIN NOW hear — Leaprosies and bluest Plagues! END
BEGIN NOW Room, room for Hell to belch her Horrors up And drench the Circes in a stream of Fire; Heark how th' Infernals eccho to my Rage Their Whips and Snakes — How lewd a thing is Passion! END
BEGIN NOW So old and stomachfull. END
BEGIN NOW [Lightning and Thunder. END
BEGIN NOW Heav'ns drop your Patience down; You see me here, ye Gods, a poor old Man As full of Griefs as Age, wretched in both — I'll bear no more: no, you unnatural Haggs, I will have such Revenges on you both, That all the world shall — I will do such things What they are yet I know not, but they shall be The Terrors of the Earth; you think I'll weep, [Thunder again.

BEGIN NOW I will forget my Nature, what? END
BEGIN NOW so kind a Father, I, there's the point. END
BEGIN NOW Consider, good my Liege, Things that love Night Love not such Nights as this; these wrathfull Skies Frighten the very wanderers o'th' Dark, And make 'em keep their Caves; such drenching Rain, Such Sheets of Fire, such Claps of horrid Thunder, Such Groans of roaring Winds have ne're been known. END
BEGIN NOW Let the Great Gods, That keep this dreadfull pudder o're our Heads Find out their Enemies now, tremble thou Wretch That hast within thee undiscover'd Crimes. END
BEGIN NOW Hide, thou bloody Hand, Thou perjur'd Villain, holy, holy Hypocrite, That drinkst the Widows Tears, sigh now and cry These dreadfull Summoners Grace, I am a Man More sin'd against than sinning. END
BEGIN NOW Good Sir, to th' Hovell. END
BEGIN NOW My wit begins to burn, Come on my Boy, how dost my Boy? END
BEGIN NOW art Cold? END
BEGIN NOW I'm cold my Self; shew me this Straw, my Fellow, The Art of our Necessity is strange, And can make vile things precious; my poor Knave, Cold as I am at Heart, I've one place There [Lond. END

BEGIN NOW O for a Tast of such Majestick Beauty, Which none but my hot Veins are fit t' engage; Nor are my Wishes desp'rate, for ev'n now During the Banquet I observed their Glances Shot thick at me, and as they left the Room Each cast by stealth a kind inviting Smile, The happy Earnest — ha! END

BEGIN NOW O my glowing Blood! END
BEGIN NOW I am already sick of expectation, And pant for the Possession — here Gloster comes With Bus'ness on his Brow; be husht my Joys. END
BEGIN NOW I come to seek thee, Edmund, to impart a business of Importance; I knew thy loyal Heart is toucht to see the Cruelty of these ingratefull Daughters against our royal Master. END
BEGIN NOW Most Savage and Unnatural. END
BEGIN NOW This change in the State sits uneasie. END
BEGIN NOW The Commons repine aloud at their female Tyrants, already they Cry out for the re-installment of their good old King, whose Injuries I fear will inflame 'em into Mutiny. END
BEGIN NOW 'Tis to be hopt, not fear'd. END
BEGIN NOW Thou hast it Boy, 'tis to be hopt indeed, On me they cast their Eyes, and hourly Court me To lead 'em on, and whilst this Head is Mine I am Theirs, a little covert Craft, my Boy, And then for open Action, 'twill be Employment Worthy such honest daring Souls as Thine. END
BEGIN NOW Thou, Edmund, art my trusty Emissary, Haste on the Spur at the first break of day With these Dispatches to the Duke of Combray; [Gives him Letters. END
BEGIN NOW You know what mortal Feuds have alwaies flam'd Between this Duke of Cornwall's Family, and his Full Twenty thousand Mountaners Th' invetrate Prince will send to our Assistance. END

BEGIN NOW Do we wake, Arante? END
BEGIN NOW My Father seeks my Life, which I preserv'd In hopes of some blest Minute to oblidge Distrest Cordelia, and the Gods have giv'n it; That Thought alone prevail'd with me to take This Frantick Dress, to make the Earth my Bed, With these bare Limbs all change of Seasons bide, Noons scorching Heat, and Midnights piercing Cold, To feed on Offals, and to drink with Herds, To Combat with the Winds, and be the Sport Of Clowns, or what's more wretched yet, their Pity. END
BEGIN NOW Ar. END
BEGIN NOW Was ever Tale so full of Misery! END
BEGIN NOW But such a Fall as this I grant was due To my aspiring Love, for 'twas presumptuous, Though not presumptuously persu'd; For well you know I wore my Flames conceal'd, And silent as the Lamps that Burn in Tombs, 'Till you perceiv'd my Grief, with modest Grace Drew forth the Secret, and then seal'd my Pardon. END
BEGIN NOW You had your Pardon, nor can you Challenge more. END
BEGIN NOW What do I Challenge more? END
BEGIN NOW Such Vanity agrees not with these Rags; When in my prosp'rous State rich Gloster's Heir, You silenc'd my Pretences, and enjoyn'd me To trouble you upon that Theam no more; Then what Reception must Love's Language find From these bare Limbs and Beggers humble Weeds? END
BEGIN NOW Such as the Voice of Pardon to a Wretch Condemn'd; Such as the Shouts Of succ'ring Forces to a Town besieg'd. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END

BEGIN NOW Is't possible? END
BEGIN NOW By the dear Vital Stream that baths my Heart, These hallow'd Rags of Thine, and naked Vertue, These abject Tassels, these fantastick Shreds, (Ridiculous ev'n to the meanest Clown) To me are dearer than the richest Pomp Of purple Monarchs. END
BEGIN NOW Generous charming Maid, The Gods alone that made, can rate thy Worth! END
BEGIN NOW This most amazing Excellence shall be Fame's Triumph, in succeeding Ages, when Thy bright Example shall adorn the Scene, And teach the World Perfection. END
BEGIN NOW Cold and weary, We'll rest a while, Arante, on that Straw, Then forward to find out the poor Old King. END
BEGIN NOW Look I have Flint and Steel, the Implements Of wandring Lunaticks, I'll strike a Light, And make a Fire beneath this Shed, to dry Thy Storm-drencht Garments, e're thou Lie to rest thee; Then Fierce and Wakefull as th' Hesperian Dragon, I'll watch beside thee to protect thy Sleep; Mean while, the Stars shall dart their kindest Beams, And Angels Visit my Cordelia's Dreams [ The Palace.

BEGIN NOW Then double be our Vengeance, this confirms Th'Intelligence that we now now receiv'd, That he has been this Night to seek the King; But who, Sir, was the kind Discoverer? END
BEGIN NOW Our Eagle, quick to spy, and fierce to seize, Our trusty Edmund. END
BEGIN NOW 'Twas a noble Service; O Cornwall, take him to thy deepest Trust, And wear him as a Jewel at thy Heart. END
BEGIN NOW Think, Sir, how hard a Fortune I sustain, That makes me thus repent of serving you! END
BEGIN NOW [Weeps. END
BEGIN NOW O that this Treason had not been, or I Not the Discoverer. END
BEGIN NOW Edmund, Thou shalt find A Father in our Love, and from this Minute We call thee Earl of Gloster; but there yet Remains another Justice to be done, And that's to punish this discarded Traytor; But least thy tender Nature shou'd relent At his just Sufferings, nor brooke the Sight, We wish thee to withdraw.

BEGIN NOW Whom spight of our Decree thou saw'st last Night. END
BEGIN NOW I'm tide to th'Stake, and I must stand the Course. END
BEGIN NOW Say where, and why thou hast conceal'd him. END
BEGIN NOW Because I wou'd not see thy cruel Hands Tear out his poor old Eyes, nor thy fierce Sister Carve his anointed Flesh; but I shall see The swift wing'd Vengeance overtake such Children. END
BEGIN NOW See't shalt thou never, Slaves perform your Work, Out with those treacherous Eyes, dispatch, I say, If thou seest Vengeance — He that will think to live 'till he be old, Give me some help — O cruel! END

BEGIN NOW Edmund, enkindle all the sparks of Nature To quit this horrid Act. END
BEGIN NOW Out, treacherous Villain, Thou call'st on him that Hates thee, it was He That broacht thy Treason, shew'd us thy Dispatches; There — read, and save the Cambrian Prince a Labour, If thy Eyes fail thee call for Spectacles. END
BEGIN NOW O my Folly! END
BEGIN NOW Than Edgar was abus'd, kind Gods forgive me that. END

BEGIN NOW O Misery! END
BEGIN NOW what words can sound my Grief? END
BEGIN NOW Shut from the Living whilst among the Living; Dark as the Grave amidst the bustling World. END
BEGIN NOW At once from Business and from Pleasure bar'd; No more to view the Beauty of the Spring, Nor see the Face of Kindred, or of Friend. END

BEGIN NOW Must I then tamely Die, and unreveng'd? END
BEGIN NOW So Lear may fall: No, with these bleeding Rings I will present me to the pittying Crowd, And with the Rhetorick of these dropping Veins Enflame 'em to Revenge their King and me; Then when the Glorious Mischief is on Wing, This Lumber from some Precipice I'll throw, And dash it on the ragged Flint below; Whence my freed Soul to her bright Sphear shall fly, Through boundless Orbs, eternal Regions spy, And like the Sun, be All one glorious Eye.

BEGIN NOW Here like a Shepherd in a lonely Shade, Idle, unarm'd, and listning to the Fight. END
BEGIN NOW Yet the disabled Courser, Maim'd and Blind, When to his Stall he hears the ratling War, Foaming with Rage tears up the batter'd Ground, And tugs for Liberty. END

BEGIN NOW Pardon me, Sir, that I presume to stop A Prince and Conquerour, yet e'er you Triumph, Give Ear to what a Stranger can deliver Of what concerns you more than Triumph can. END
BEGIN NOW I do impeach your General there of Treason, Lord Edmund, that usurps the Name of Gloster, Of fowlest Practice 'gainst your Life and Honour; This Charge is True, and wretched though I seem I can produce a Champion that will prove In single Combat what I do avouch; If Edmund dares but trust his Cause and Sword.

BEGIN NOW This language, Sir, adds yet to our Affliction. END
BEGIN NOW Thou, Kent, didst head the Troops that fought my Battel, Expos'd thy Life and Fortunes for a Master That had (as I remember) banisht Thee. END
BEGIN NOW Pardon me, Sir, that once I broke your Orders, Banisht by you, I kept me here disguis'd To watch your Fortunes, and protect your Person, You know you entertain'd a rough blunt Fellow, One Cajus, and you thought he did you Service. END
BEGIN NOW My trusty Cajus, I have lost him too! END

BEGIN NOW From all thy Troops and Thee, I forc't the Field, Thou hast lost the gen'ral Stake, and art Thou now Come with thy petty single Stock to play This after-Game? END

BEGIN NOW Thou bear'st thee on thy Mother's Piety, Which I despise; thy Mother being chaste Thou art assur'd Thou art but Gloster's Son, But mine, disdaining Constancy, leaves me To hope that I am sprung from nobler Blood, And possibly a King might be my Sire: But be my Birth's uncertain Chance as 'twill, Who 'twas that had the hit to Father me I know not; 'tis enough that I am I: Of this one thing I'm certain — that I have A daring Soul, and so have at thy Heart Sound Trumpet.

BEGIN NOW cou'd there be Beauty like Mine, and Gallantry like His And not a mutual Love? END
BEGIN NOW just Nature then Had err'd: behold that Copy of Perfection, That Youth whose Story will have no foul Page But where it says he stoopt to Regan's Arms: Which yet was but Compliance, not Affection; A Charity to begging, ruin'd Beauty! END
BEGIN NOW Who begg'd when Gonerill writ That? END
BEGIN NOW expose it [Throws her a Letter. END
BEGIN NOW And let it be your Army's mirth, as 'twas This charming Youth's and mine, when in the Bow'r He breath'd the warmest ecstasies of Love, Then panting on my Breast, cry'd matchless Regan That Gonerill and Thou shou'd e'er be Kin! END
BEGIN NOW Die, Circe, for thy Charms are at an End, Expire before my Face, and let me see How well that boasted Beauty will become Congealing Blood and Death's convulsive Pangs. END
BEGIN NOW Die and be husht, for at my Tent last Night Thou drank'st thy Bane, amidst thy rev'ling Bowls: Ha! END
BEGIN NOW dost thou Smile? END
BEGIN NOW is then thy Death thy Sport Or has the trusty Potion made thee Mad? END
BEGIN NOW Thou com'st as short of me in thy Revenge As in my Gloster's Love, my Jealousie Inspir'd me to prevent thy feeble Malice And Poison Thee at thy own Banquet. END
BEGIN NOW Ha! END
BEGIN NOW No more, my Queens, of this untimely Strife, You both deserv'd my Love and both possest it. END
BEGIN NOW Come, Souldiers, bear me in; and let Your royal Presence grace my last minutes: Now, Edgar, thy proud Conquest I forgive; Who wou'd not choose, like me, to yield his Breath T'have Rival Queens contend for him in Death? END
BEGIN NOW [ A Prison. END
BEGIN NOW Lear asleep, with his Head on Cordelia's Lap. END
BEGIN NOW What Toils, thou wretched King, hast Thou endur'd To make thee draw, in Chains, a Sleep so sound? END
BEGIN NOW Thy better Angel charm thy ravisht Mind With fancy'd Freedom; Peace is us'd to lodge On Cottage Straw, Thou hast the Begger's Bed, Therefore shou'dst have the Begger's careless Thought. END
BEGIN NOW And now, my Edgar, I remember Thee, What Fate has seiz'd Thee in this general Wreck I know not, but I know thou must be wretched Because Cordelia holds Thee Dear. END
BEGIN NOW O Gods! END
BEGIN NOW a suddain Gloom o'er-whelms me, and the Image Of Death o'er-spreads the Place. END

BEGIN NOW who are These? END
BEGIN NOW Now, Sirs, dispatch, already you are paid In part, the best of your Reward's to come. END
BEGIN NOW Charge, charge upon their Flank, their last Wing haults; Push, push the Battel, and the Day's our own. END

BEGIN NOW Who holds my Hands? END
BEGIN NOW — O thou deceiving Sleep, I was this very Minute on the Chace; And now a Prisoner here — What mean the Slaves? END
BEGIN NOW You will not Murder me? END

BEGIN NOW By whose Command? END
BEGIN NOW Behold the Duke your Lord. END
BEGIN NOW Guards, seize those Instruments of Cruelty. END
BEGIN NOW My Edgar, Oh! END
BEGIN NOW My dear Cordelia, Lucky was the Minute Of our Approach, the Gods have weigh'd our Suffrings; W' are past the Fire, and now must shine to Ages. END
BEGIN NOW Look here, my Lord, see where the generous King Has slain Two of 'em. END
BEGIN NOW Did I not, Fellow? END
BEGIN NOW I've seen the Day, with my good biting Faulchion I cou'd have made 'em skip; I am Old now, And these vile Crosses spoil me; Out of Breath! END
BEGIN NOW Fie, Oh! END
BEGIN NOW quite out of Breath and spent. END
BEGIN NOW Bring in old Kent, and, Edgar, guide you hither Your Father, whom you said was near, [Ex. END
BEGIN NOW He may be an Ear-witness at the least Of our Proceedings. END
BEGIN NOW [Kent brought in here. END
BEGIN NOW Who are you? END
BEGIN NOW My Eyes are none o' th' best, I'll tell you streight; Oh Albany! END
BEGIN NOW Well, Sir, we are your Captives, And you are come to see Death pass upon us. END
BEGIN NOW Why this Delay? END
BEGIN NOW — or is't your Highness pleasure To give us first the Torture? END
BEGIN NOW Say ye so? END
BEGIN NOW Why here's old Kent and I, as tough a Pair As e'er bore Tyrant's Stroke: — but my Cordelia, My poor Cordelia here, O pitty! END
BEGIN NOW — Take off their Chains — Thou injur'd Majesty, The Wheel of Fortune now has made her Circle, And Blessings yet stand 'twixt thy Grave and Thee. END
BEGIN NOW Com'st Thou, inhumane Lord, to sooth us back To a Fool's Paradise of Hope, to make Our Doom more wretched? END
BEGIN NOW go too, we are too well Acquainted with Misfortune to be gull'd With Lying Hope; No, we will hope no more. END
BEGIN NOW I have a Tale t' unfold so full of Wonder As cannot meet an easy Faith; But by that Royal injur'd Head 'tis True. END
BEGIN NOW What wou'd your Highness? END
BEGIN NOW Know the noble Edgar Impeacht Lord Edmund since the Fight, of Treason, And dar'd him for the Proof to single Combat, In which the Gods confirm'd his Charge by Conquest; I left ev'n now the Traytor wounded Mortally. END
BEGIN NOW And whither tends this Story? END
BEGIN NOW E'er they fought Lord Edgar gave into my Hands this Paper, A blacker Scrowl of Treason, and of Lust Than can be found in the Records of Hell; There, Sacred Sir, behold the Character Of Gonerill the worst of Daughters, but More Vicious Wife. END
BEGIN NOW Cou'd there be yet Addition to their Guilt? END
BEGIN NOW What will not They that wrong a Father doe? END
BEGIN NOW Since then my Injuries, Lear, fall in with Thine: I have resolv'd the same Redress for Both. END
BEGIN NOW What says my Lord? END
BEGIN NOW Speak, for me thought I heard The charming Voice of a descending God. END
BEGIN NOW The Troops by Edmund rais'd, I have disbanded; Those that remain are under my Command. END
BEGIN NOW What Comfort may be brought to cheer your Age And heal your savage Wrongs, shall be apply'd; For to your Majesty we do Resign Your Kingdom, save what Part your Self conferr'd On Us in Marriage. END
BEGIN NOW Hear you that, my Liege? END
BEGIN NOW Then there are Gods, and Vertue is their Care. END
BEGIN NOW Is 't Possible? END
BEGIN NOW Let the Spheres stop their Course, the Sun make Hault, The Winds be husht, the Seas and Fountains Rest; All Nature pause, and listen to the Change. END
BEGIN NOW Where is my Kent, my Cajus? END
BEGIN NOW Here, my Liege. END
BEGIN NOW Why I have News that will recall thy Youth; Ha! END
BEGIN NOW Didst Thou hear 't, or did th' inspiring Gods Whisper to me Alone? END
BEGIN NOW Old Lear shall be A King again. END
BEGIN NOW The Prince, that like a God has Pow'r, has said it. END
BEGIN NOW Cordelia then shall be a Queen, mark that: Cordelia shall be Queen; Winds catch the Sound And bear it on your rosie Wings to Heav'n. END
BEGIN NOW Cordelia is a Queen. END
BEGIN NOW Re-enter Edgar with Gloster. END
BEGIN NOW Look, Sir, where pious Edgar comes Leading his Eye-less Father: O my Liege! END
BEGIN NOW His wondrous Story will deserve your Leisure: What He has done and suffer'd for your Sake, What for the Fair Cordelia's. END
BEGIN NOW Where is my Liege? END
BEGIN NOW Conduct me to his Knees to hail His second Birth of Empire; my dear Edgar Has, with himself, reveal'd the King's blest Restauration. END
BEGIN NOW My poor dark Gloster; O let me kiss that once more sceptred Hand! END
BEGIN NOW Hold, Thou mistak'st the Majesty, kneel here; Cordelia has our Pow'r, Cordelia's Queen. END
BEGIN NOW Speak, is not that the noble Suffring Edgar? END
BEGIN NOW My pious Son, more dear than my lost Eyes. END
BEGIN NOW I wrong'd Him too, but here's the fair Amends. END
BEGIN NOW Your leave, my Liege, for an unwelcome Message. END
BEGIN NOW Edmund (but that 's a Triflle) is expir'd; What more will touch you, your imperious Daughters Gonerill and haughty Regan, both are Dead, Each by the other poison'd at a Banquet; This, Dying, they confest. END
BEGIN NOW O fatal Period of ill-govern'd Life! END
BEGIN NOW Ingratefull as they were, my Heart feels yet A Pang of Nature for their wretched Fall; — But, Edgar, I defer thy Joys too long: Thou serv'dst distrest Cordelia; take her Crown'd: Th' imperial Grace fresh Blooming on her Brow; Nay, Gloster, Thou hast here a Father's Right; Thy helping Hand t' heap Blessings on their Head. END
BEGIN NOW Old Kent throws in his hearty Wishes too. END
BEGIN NOW The Gods and You too largely recompence What I have done; the Gift strikes Merit Dumb. END
BEGIN NOW Nor do I blush to own my Self o'er-paid For all my Suffrings past. END
BEGIN NOW Now, gentle Gods, give Gloster his Discharge. END
BEGIN NOW No, Gloster, Thou hast Business yet for Life; Thou, Kent and I, retir'd to some cool Cell Will gently pass our short reserves of Time In calm Reflections on our Fortunes past, Cheer'd with relation of the prosperous Reign Of this celestial Pair; Thus our Remains Shall in an even Course of Thought be past, Enjoy the present Hour, nor fear the Last. END
BEGIN NOW Our drooping Country now erects her Head, Peace spreads her balmy Wings, and Plenty Blooms. END
BEGIN NOW Divine Cordelia, all the Gods can witness How much thy Love to Empire I prefer! END
BEGIN NOW Thy bright Example shall convince the World (Whatever Storms of Fortune are decreed) That Truth and Vertue shall at last succeed. END
BEGIN NOW [Ex. END
BEGIN NOW Omnes. END
BEGIN NOW FINIS. END
BEGIN NOW EPILOGUE, Spoken by Mrs. BARRY Inconstancy, the reigning Sin o' th' Age, Will scarce endure true Lovers on the Stage; You hardly ev'n in Plays with such dispense, And Poëts kill 'em in their own Defence. END
BEGIN NOW Yet One bold Proof I was resolv'd to give, That I cou'd three Hours Constancy Out-live. END
BEGIN NOW You fear, perhaps, whilst on the Stage w' are made Such Saints, we shall indeed take up the Trade; Sometimes we Threaten — but our Vertue may For Truth I fear with your Pit-Valour weigh: For (not to flatter either) I much doubt When We are off the Stage, and You are out, We are not quite so Coy, nor You so Stout. END
BEGIN NOW We talk of Nunn'ries — but to be sincere Whoever lives to see us Cloyster'd There, May hope to meet our Critiques at Tangier. END
BEGIN NOW For shame give over this inglorious Trade Of worrying Poëts, and go maule th' Alcade. END
BEGIN NOW Well — since y' are All for blustring in the Pit, This Play's Reviver humbly do's admit Your abs'lute Pow'r to damn his Part of it; But still so many Master-Touches shine Of that vast Hand that first laid this Design, That in great Shakespear's Right, He's bold to say If you like nothing you have seen to Day The Play your Judgment damns, not you the Play.  END
BEGIN NOW SO MANY FUCKING FEELINGS ABOUT THE FOOL IN KING LEAR I MUST PUT ON MY MOTLEY AND CRY BITTERSWEET TEARS  END
BEGIN NOW The servant who dies defending Gloucester grew up with Cornwall and, though he doesn’t have words to express it, is deeply in love with him. END
BEGIN NOW His decision to intervene stems from his desire to save Cornwall’s soul from his wife’s clutches rather than from any sense of duty toward Gloucester.  END
BEGIN NOW WE were a party of six, gathered together one winter evening at the house of an old college friend. END
BEGIN NOW The conversation turned on Shakespeare, on his types, and how profoundly and truly they were taken from the very heart of humanity. END
BEGIN NOW We admired particularly their truth to life, their actuality. END
BEGIN NOW Each of us spoke of the Hamlets, the Othellos, the Falstaffs, even the Richard the Thirds and Macbeths&mdash;the two last only potentially, it is true, resembling their prototypes&mdash;whom he had happened to come across. END
BEGIN NOW And I, gentlemen, cried our host, a man well past middle age, used to know a King Lear! END
BEGIN NOW How was that? END
BEGIN NOW we questioned him. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, would you like me to tell you about him? END
BEGIN NOW Please do. END
BEGIN NOW And our friend promptly began his narrative. END
BEGIN NOW ALL my childhood, he began, and early youth, up to the age of fifteen, I spent in the country, on the estate of my mother, a wealthy landowner in X&mdash;- province. END
BEGIN NOW Almost the most vivid impression, that has remained in my memory of that far-off time, is the figure of our nearest neighbour, Martin Petrovitch Harlov. END
BEGIN NOW Indeed it would be difficult for such an impression to be obliterated: I never in my life afterwards met anything in the least like Harlov. END
BEGIN NOW Picture to yourselves a man of gigantic stature. END
BEGIN NOW On his huge carcase was set, a little askew, and without the least trace of a neck, a prodigious head. END
BEGIN NOW A perfect haystack of tangled yellowish-grey hair stood up all over it, growing almost down to the bushy eyebrows. END
BEGIN NOW On the broad expanse of his purple face, that looked as though it had been peeled, there protruded a sturdy knobby nose; diminutive little blue eyes stared out haughtily, and a mouth gaped open that was diminutive too, but crooked, chapped, and of the same colour as the rest of the face. END
BEGIN NOW The voice that proceeded from this mouth, though hoarse, was exceedingly strong and resonant.\. END
BEGIN NOW Its sound recalled the clank of iron bars, carried in a cart over a badly paved road; and when Harlov spoke, it was as though some one were shouting in a high wind across a wide ravine. END
BEGIN NOW It was difficult to tell just what Harlov's face expressed, it was such an expanse.\. END
BEGIN NOW One felt one could hardly take it all in at one glance. END
BEGIN NOW But it was not disagreeable&mdash;a certain grandeur indeed could be discerned in it, only it was exceedingly astounding and unusual. END
BEGIN NOW And what hands he had&mdash;positive cushions! END
BEGIN NOW What fingers, what feet! END
BEGIN NOW I remember I could never gaze without a certain respectful awe at the four-foot span of Martin Petrovitch's back, at his shoulders, like millstones. END
BEGIN NOW But what especially struck me was his ears! END
BEGIN NOW They were just like great twists of bread, full of bends and curves; his cheeks seemed to support them on both sides. END
BEGIN NOW Martin Petrovitch used to wear&mdash;winter and summer alike&mdash;a Cossack dress of green cloth, girt about with a small Tcherkess strap, and tarred boots. END
BEGIN NOW I never saw a cravat on him; and indeed what could he have tied a cravat round? END
BEGIN NOW He breathed slowly and heavily, like a bull, but walked without a sound. END
BEGIN NOW One might have imagined that having got into a room, he was in constant fear of upsetting and overturning everything, and so moved cautiously from place to place, sideways for the most part, as though slinking by. END
BEGIN NOW He was possessed of a strength truly Herculean, and in consequence enjoyed great renown in the neighbourhood. END
BEGIN NOW Our common people retain to this day their reverence for Titanic heroes. END
BEGIN NOW Legends were invented about him. END
BEGIN NOW They used to recount that he had one day met a bear in the forest and had almost vanquished him; that having once caught a thief in his beehouse, he had flung him, horse and cart and all, over the hedge, and so on. END
BEGIN NOW Harlov himself never boasted of his strength. END
BEGIN NOW 'If my right hand is blessed,' he used to say, 'so it is God's will it should be!' END
BEGIN NOW He was proud, only he did not take pride in his strength, but in his rank, his descent, his common sense. END
BEGIN NOW Our family's descended from the Swede Harlus, he used to maintain. END
BEGIN NOW In the princely reign of Ivan Vassilievitch the Dark (fancy how long ago!) END
BEGIN NOW he came to Russia, and that Swede Harlus did not wish to be a Finnish count&mdash;but he wished to be a Russian nobleman, and he was inscribed in the golden book. END
BEGIN NOW It's from him we Harlovs are sprung!\. END
BEGIN NOW And by the same token, all of us Harlovs are born flaxen-haired, with light eyes and clean faces, because we're children of the snow! END
BEGIN NOW But, Martin Petrovitch, I once tried to object, there never was an Ivan Vassilievitch the Dark. END
BEGIN NOW Then was an Ivan Vassilievitch the Terrible. END
BEGIN NOW The Dark was the name given to the great prince Vassily Vassilievitch. END
BEGIN NOW What nonsense will you talk next! END
BEGIN NOW Harlov answered serenely; since I say so, so it was! END
BEGIN NOW One day my mother took it into her head to commend him to his face for his really remarkable incorruptibility. END
BEGIN NOW Ah, Natalia Nikolaevna! END
BEGIN NOW he protested almost angrily; what a thing to praise me for, really! END
BEGIN NOW We gentlefolk can't be otherwise; so that no churl, no low-born, servile creature dare even imagine evil of us! END
BEGIN NOW I am a Harlov, my family has come down from'&mdash;here he pointed up somewhere very high aloft in the ceiling&mdash;'and me not be honest! END
BEGIN NOW How is it possible? END
BEGIN NOW Another time a high official, who had come into the neighbourhood and was staying with my mother, fancied he could make fun of Martin Petrovitch. END
BEGIN NOW The latter had again referred to the Swede Harlus, who came to Russia\. END
BEGIN NOW In the days of King Solomon? END
BEGIN NOW the official interrupted. END
BEGIN NOW No, not of King Solomon, but of the great Prince Ivan Vassilievitch the Dark. END
BEGIN NOW But I imagine, the official pursued, that your family is much more ancient, and goes back to antediluvian days, when there were still mastodons and megatheriums about. END
BEGIN NOW These scientific names were absolutely meaningless to Martin Petrovitch; but he realised that the dignitary was laughing at him. END
BEGIN NOW May be so, he boomed, our family is, no doubt, very ancient; in those days when my ancestor was in Moscow, they do say there was as great a fool as your excellency living there, and such fools are not seen twice in a thousand years. END
BEGIN NOW The high official was in a furious rage, while Harlov threw his head back, stuck out his chin, snorted and disappeared. END
BEGIN NOW Two days later, he came in again. END
BEGIN NOW My mother began reproaching him. END
BEGIN NOW It's a lesson for him, ma'am, interposed Harlov, not to fly off without knowing what he's about, to find out whom he has to deal with first. END
BEGIN NOW He's young yet, he must be taught. END
BEGIN NOW The dignitary was almost of the same age as Harlov; but this Titan was in the habit of regarding every one as not fully grown up. END
BEGIN NOW He had the greatest confidence in himself and was afraid of absolutely no one. END
BEGIN NOW Can they do anything to me? END
BEGIN NOW Where on earth is the man that can? END
BEGIN NOW he would ask, and suddenly he would go off into a short but deafening guffaw. END
BEGIN NOW MY mother was exceedingly particular in her choice of acquaintances, but she made Harlov welcome with special cordiality and allowed him many privileges. END
BEGIN NOW Twenty-five years before, he had saved her life by holding up her carriage on the edge of a deep precipice, down which the horses had already fallen. END
BEGIN NOW The traces and straps of the harness broke, but Martin Petrovitch did not let go his hold of the wheel he had grasped, though the blood spurted out under his nails. END
BEGIN NOW My mother had arranged his marriage. END
BEGIN NOW She chose for his wife an orphan girl of seventeen, who had been brought up in her house; he was over forty at the time. END
BEGIN NOW Martin Petrovitch's wife was a frail creature&mdash;they said he carried her into his house in the palms of his hands&mdash;and she did not live long with him. END
BEGIN NOW She bore him two daughters, however. END
BEGIN NOW After her death, my mother continued her good offices to Martin Petrovitch. END
BEGIN NOW She placed his elder daughter in the district school, and afterwards found her a husband, and already had another in her eye for the second. END
BEGIN NOW Harlov was a fairly good manager. END
BEGIN NOW He had a little estate of nearly eight hundred acres, and had built on to his place a little, and the way the peasants obeyed him is indescribable. END
BEGIN NOW Owing to his stoutness, Harlov scarcely ever went anywhere on foot: the earth did not bear him. END
BEGIN NOW He used to go everywhere in a low racing droshky, himself driving a rawboned mare, thirty years old, with a scar on her shoulder, from a wound which she had received in the battle of Borodino, under the quartermaster of a cavalry regiment. END
BEGIN NOW This mare was always somehow lame in all four legs; she could not go at a walking pace, but could only change from a trot to a canter. END
BEGIN NOW She used to eat mugwort and wormwood along the hedges, which I have never noticed any other horse do. END
BEGIN NOW I remember I always used to wonder how such a broken-down nag could draw such a fearful weight. END
BEGIN NOW I won't venture to repeat how many hundredweight were attributed to our neighbour. END
BEGIN NOW In the droshky behind Martin Petrovitch's back perched his swarthy page, Maximka. END
BEGIN NOW With his face and whole person squeezed close up to his master, and his bare feet propped on the hind axle bar of the droshky, he looked like a little leaf or worm which had clung by chance to the gigantic carcase before him. END
BEGIN NOW This same page boy used once a week to shave Martin Petrovitch. END
BEGIN NOW He used, so they said, to stand on a table to perform this operation. END
BEGIN NOW Some jocose persons averred that he had to run round his master's chin. END
BEGIN NOW Harlov did not like staying long at home, and so one might often see him driving about in his invariable equipage, with the reins in one hand (the other he held smartly on his knee with the elbow crooked upwards), with a diminutive old cap on the very top of his head. END
BEGIN NOW He looked boldly about him with his little bear-like eyes, shouted in a voice of thunder to all the peasants, artisans, and tradespeople he met. END
BEGIN NOW Priests he greatly disliked, and he would send vigorous abjurations after them when he met them. END
BEGIN NOW One day on overtaking me (I was out for a stroll with my gun), he hallooed at a hare that lay near the road in such a way that I could not get the roar and ring of it out of my ears all day. END
BEGIN NOW MY mother, as I have already stated, made Martin Petrovitch very welcome. END
BEGIN NOW She knew what a profound respect he entertained for her person. END
BEGIN NOW She is a real gentlewoman, one of our sort, was the way he used to refer to her. END
BEGIN NOW He used to style her his benefactress, while she saw in him a devoted giant, who would not have hesitated to face a whole mob of peasants in defence of her; and although no one foresaw the barest possibility of such a contingency, still, to my mother's notions, in the absence of a husband&mdash;she had early been left a widow&mdash;such a champion as Martin Petrovitch was not to be despised. END
BEGIN NOW And besides, he was a man of upright character, who curried favour with no one, never borrowed money or drank spirits; and no fool either, though he had received no sort of education. END
BEGIN NOW My mother trusted Martin Petrovitch: when she took it into her head to make her will, she asked him to witness it, and he drove home expressly to fetch his round iron-rimmed spectacles, without which he could not write. END
BEGIN NOW And with spectacles on nose, he succeeded, in a quarter of an hour, with many gasps and groans and great effort, in inscribing his Christian name, father's name, and surname and his rank and designation, tracing enormous quadrangular letters, with tails and flourishes. END
BEGIN NOW Having completed this task, he declared he was tired out, and that writing for him was as hard work as catching fleas. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, my mother had a respect for him.\. END
BEGIN NOW he was not, however, admitted beyond the dining-room in our house. END
BEGIN NOW He carried a very strong odour about with him; there was a smell of the earth, of decaying forest, of marsh mud about him. END
BEGIN NOW He's a forest-demon! END
BEGIN NOW my old nurse would declare. END
BEGIN NOW At dinner a special table used to be laid apart in a corner for Martin Petrovitch, and he was not offended at that, he knew other people were ill at ease sitting beside him, and he too had greater freedom in eating. END
BEGIN NOW And he did eat too, as no one, I imagine, has eaten since the days of Polyphemus. END
BEGIN NOW At the very beginning of dinner, by way of a precautionary measure, they always served him a pot of some four pounds of porridge, else you'd eat me out of house and home, my mother used to say. END
BEGIN NOW That I should, ma'am, Martin Petrovitch would respond, grinning. END
BEGIN NOW My mother liked to hear his reflections on any topic connected with the land. END
BEGIN NOW But she could not support the sound of his voice for long together. END
BEGIN NOW What's the meaning of it, my good sir! END
BEGIN NOW she would exclaim; you might take something to cure yourself of it, really! END
BEGIN NOW You simply deafen me. END
BEGIN NOW Such a trumpet-blast! END
BEGIN NOW Natalia Nikolaevna! END
BEGIN NOW benefactress! END
BEGIN NOW Martin Petrovitch would rejoin, as a rule, I'm not responsible for my throat. END
BEGIN NOW And what medicine could have any effect on me&mdash;kindly tell me that? END
BEGIN NOW I'd better hold my tongue for a bit. END
BEGIN NOW In reality, I imagine, no medicine could have affected Martin Petrovitch. END
BEGIN NOW He was never ill. END
BEGIN NOW He was not good at telling stories, and did not care for it. END
BEGIN NOW Much talking gives me asthma, he used to remark reproachfully. END
BEGIN NOW It was only when one got him on to the year &mdash;he had served in the militia, and had received a bronze medal, which he used to wear on festive occasions attached to a Vladimir ribbon&mdash;when one questioned him about the French, that he would relate some few anecdotes. END
BEGIN NOW He used, however, to maintain stoutly all the while that there never had been any Frenchmen, real ones, in Russia, only some poor marauders, who had straggled over from hunger, and that he had given many a good drubbing to such rabble in the forests. END
BEGIN NOW AND yet even this self-confident, unflinching giant had his moments of melancholy and depression. END
BEGIN NOW Without any visible cause he would suddenly begin to be sad; he would lock himself up alone in his room, and hum&mdash;positively hum&mdash;like a whole hive of bees; or he would call his page Maximka, and tell him to read aloud to him out of the solitary book which had somehow found its way into his house, an odd volume of Novikovsky's The Worker at Leisure, or else to sing to him. END
BEGIN NOW And Maximka, who by some strange freak of chance, could spell out print, syllable by syllable, would set to work with the usual chopping up of the words and transference of the accent, bawling out phrases of the following description: but man in his wilfulness draws from this empty hypothesis, which he applies to the animal kingdom, utterly opposite conclusions. END
BEGIN NOW Every animal separately, he says, is not capable of making me happy! END
BEGIN NOW and so on. END
BEGIN NOW Or he would chant in a shrill little voice a mournful song, of which nothing could be distinguished but: Ee\. END
BEGIN NOW eee\. END
BEGIN NOW ee.\. END
BEGIN NOW a.\. END
BEGIN NOW ee.\. END
BEGIN NOW a.\. END
BEGIN NOW ee.\. END
BEGIN NOW Aaa.\. END
BEGIN NOW ska! END
BEGIN NOW O.\. END
BEGIN NOW oo.\. END
BEGIN NOW oo.\. END
BEGIN NOW bee.\. END
BEGIN NOW ee.\. END
BEGIN NOW ee.\. END
BEGIN NOW ee.\. END
BEGIN NOW la! END
BEGIN NOW While Martin Petrovitch would shake his head, make allusions to the mutability of life, how all things turn to ashes, fade away like grass, pass&mdash;and will return no more! END
BEGIN NOW A picture had somehow come into his hands, representing a burning candle, which the winds, with puffed-out cheeks, were blowing upon from all sides; below was the inscription: Such is the life of man. END
BEGIN NOW He was very fond of this picture; he had hung it up in his own room, but at ordinary, not melancholy, times he used to keep it turned face to the wall, so that it might not depress him. END
BEGIN NOW Harlov, that colossus, was afraid of death! END
BEGIN NOW To the consolations of religion, to prayer, however, he rarely had recourse in his fits of melancholy. END
BEGIN NOW Even then he chiefly relied on his own intelligence. END
BEGIN NOW He had no particular religious feeling; he was not often seen in church; he used to say, it is true, that he did not go on the ground that, owing to his corporeal dimensions, he was afraid of squeezing other people out. END
BEGIN NOW The fit of depression commonly ended in Martin Petrovitch's beginning to whistle, and suddenly, in a voice of thunder, ordering out his droshky, and dashing off about the neighbourhood, vigorously brandishing his disengaged hand over the peak of his cap, as though he would say, For all that, I don't care a straw! END
BEGIN NOW He was a regular Russian. END
BEGIN NOW STRONG men, like Martin Petrovitch, are for the most part of a phlegmatic disposition; but he, on the contrary, was rather easily irritated. END
BEGIN NOW He was specially short-tempered with a certain Bitchkov, who had found a refuge in our house, where he occupied a position between that of a buffoon and a dependant. END
BEGIN NOW He was the brother of Harlov's deceased wife, had been nicknamed Souvenir as a little boy, and Souvenir he had remained for every one, even the servants, who addressed him, it is true, as Souvenir Timofeitch. END
BEGIN NOW His real name he seemed hardly to know himself. END
BEGIN NOW He was a pitiful creature, looked down upon by every one; a toady, in fact. END
BEGIN NOW He had no teeth on one side of his mouth, which gave his little wrinkled face a crooked appearance. END
BEGIN NOW He was in a perpetual fuss and fidget; he used to poke himself into the maids' room, or into the counting-house, or into the priest's quarters, or else into the bailiff's hut. END
BEGIN NOW He was repelled from everywhere, but he only shrugged himself up, and screwed up his little eyes, and laughed a pitiful mawkish laugh, like the sound of rinsing a bottle. END
BEGIN NOW It always seemed to me that had Souvenir had money, he would have turned into the basest person, unprincipled, spiteful, even cruel. END
BEGIN NOW Poverty kept him within bounds. END
BEGIN NOW He was only allowed drink on holidays. END
BEGIN NOW He was decently dressed, by my mother's orders, since in the evenings he took a hand in her game of picquet or boston. END
BEGIN NOW Souvenir was constantly repeating, Certainly, d'rectly, d'rectly. END
BEGIN NOW D'rectly what? END
BEGIN NOW my mother would ask, with annoyance. END
BEGIN NOW He instantly drew back his hands, in a scare, and lisped, At your service, ma'am! END
BEGIN NOW Listening at doors, backbiting, and, above all, quizzing, teasing, were his sole interest, and he used to quiz as though he had a right to, as though he were avenging himself for something. END
BEGIN NOW He used to call Martin Petrovitch brother, and tormented him beyond endurance. END
BEGIN NOW What made you kill my sister, Margarita Timofeevna? END
BEGIN NOW he used to persist, wriggling about before him and sniggering. END
BEGIN NOW One day Martin Petrovitch was sitting in the billiard-room, a cool apartment, in which no one had ever seen a single fly, and which our neighbour, disliking heat and sunshine, greatly favoured on this account. END
BEGIN NOW He was sitting between the wall and the billiard-table. END
BEGIN NOW Souvenir was fidgeting before his bulky person, mocking him, grimacing.\. END
BEGIN NOW Martin Petrovitch wanted to get rid of him, and thrust both hands out in front of him. END
BEGIN NOW Luckily for Souvenir he managed to get away, his brother-in law's open hands came into collision with the edge of the billiard-table, and the billiard-board went flying off all its six screws.\. END
BEGIN NOW What a mass of batter Souvenir would have been turned into under those mighty hands! END
BEGIN NOW I HAD long been curious to see how Martin Petrovitch arranged his household, what sort of a home he had. END
BEGIN NOW One day I invited myself to accompany him on horseback as far as Eskovo (that was the name of his estate). END
BEGIN NOW Upon my word, you want to have a look at my dominion, was Martin Petrovitch's comment. END
BEGIN NOW By all means! END
BEGIN NOW I'll show you the garden, and the house, and the threshing-floor, and everything. END
BEGIN NOW I have plenty of everything. END
BEGIN NOW We set off. END
BEGIN NOW It was reckoned hardly more than a couple of miles from our place to Eskovo. END
BEGIN NOW Here it is&mdash;my dominion! END
BEGIN NOW Martin Petrovitch roared suddenly, trying to turn his immovable neck, and waving his arm to right and left. END
BEGIN NOW It's all mine! END
BEGIN NOW Harlov's homestead lay on the top of a sloping hill. END
BEGIN NOW At the bottom, a few wretched-looking peasants' huts clustered close to a small pond. END
BEGIN NOW At the pond, on a washing platform, an old peasant woman in a check petticoat was beating some soaked linen with a bat. END
BEGIN NOW Axinia! END
BEGIN NOW boomed Martin Petrovitch, but in such a note that the rooks flew up in a flock from an oat-field near.\. END
BEGIN NOW Washing your husband's breeches? END
BEGIN NOW The peasant woman turned at once and bowed very low. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, sir, sounded her weak voice. END
BEGIN NOW Ay, ay! END
BEGIN NOW Yonder, look, Martin Petrovitch continued, proceeding at a trot alongside a half-rotting wattle fence, that is my hemp-patch; and that yonder's the peasants'; see the difference? END
BEGIN NOW And this here is my garden; the apple-trees I planted, and the willows I planted too. END
BEGIN NOW Else there was no timber of any sort here. END
BEGIN NOW Look at that, and learn a lesson! END
BEGIN NOW We turned into the courtyard, shut in by a fence; right opposite the gate, rose an old tumbledown lodge, with a thatch roof, and steps up to it, raised on posts. END
BEGIN NOW On one side stood another, rather newer, and with a tiny attic; but it too was a ramshackly affair. END
BEGIN NOW Here you may learn a lesson again, observed Harlov; see what a little manor-house our fathers lived in; but now see what a mansion I have built myself. END
BEGIN NOW This mansion was like a house of cards. END
BEGIN NOW Five or six dogs, one more ragged and hideous than another, welcomed us with barking. END
BEGIN NOW Sheep-dogs! END
BEGIN NOW observed Martin Petrovitch. END
BEGIN NOW Pure-bred Crimeans! END
BEGIN NOW Sh, damned brutes! END
BEGIN NOW I'll come and strangle you one after another! END
BEGIN NOW On the steps of the new building, there came out a young man, in a long full nankeen overall, the husband of Martin Petrovitch's elder daughter. END
BEGIN NOW Skipping quickly up to the droshky, he respectfully supported his father-in-law under the elbow as he got up, and even made as though he would hold the gigantic feet, which the latter, bending his bulky person forward, lifted with a sweeping movement across the seat; then he assisted me to dismount from my horse. END
BEGIN NOW Anna! END
BEGIN NOW cried Harlov, Natalia Nikolaevna's son has come to pay us a visit; you must find some good cheer for him. END
BEGIN NOW But where's Evlampia? END
BEGIN NOW (Anna was the name of the elder daughter, Evlampia of the younger.) END
BEGIN NOW She's not at home; she's gone into the fields to get cornflowers, responded Anna, appearing at a little window near the door. END
BEGIN NOW Is there any junket? END
BEGIN NOW queried Harlov. END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW And cream too? END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Well, set them on the table, and I'll show the young gentleman my own room meanwhile. END
BEGIN NOW This way, please, this way, he added, addressing me, and beckoning with his forefinger. END
BEGIN NOW In his own house he treated me less familiarly; as a host he felt obliged to be more formally respectful. END
BEGIN NOW He led me along a corridor. END
BEGIN NOW Here is where I abide, he observed, stepping sideways over the threshold of a wide doorway, this is my room. END
BEGIN NOW Pray walk in! END
BEGIN NOW His room turned out to be a big unplastered apartment, almost empty; on the walls, on nails driven in askew, hung two riding-whips, a three-cornered hat, reddish with wear, a single-barrelled gun, a sabre, a sort of curious horse-collar inlaid with metal plates, and the picture representing a burning candle blown on by the winds. END
BEGIN NOW In one corner stood a wooden settle covered with a parti-coloured rug. END
BEGIN NOW Hundreds of flies swarmed thickly about the ceiling; yet the room was cool. END
BEGIN NOW But there was a very strong smell of that peculiar odour of the forest which always accompanied Martin Petrovitch. END
BEGIN NOW Well, is it a nice room? END
BEGIN NOW Harlov questioned me. END
BEGIN NOW Very nice. END
BEGIN NOW Look-ye, there hangs my Dutch horse-collar, Harlov went on, dropping into his familiar tone again. END
BEGIN NOW A splendid horse-collar! END
BEGIN NOW got it by barter off a Jew. END
BEGIN NOW Just you look at it! END
BEGIN NOW It's a good horse-collar. END
BEGIN NOW It's most practical. END
BEGIN NOW And just sniff it\. END
BEGIN NOW what leather! END
BEGIN NOW I smelt the horse-collar. END
BEGIN NOW It smelt of rancid oil and nothing else. END
BEGIN NOW Now, be seated,&mdash;there on the stool; make yourself at home, observed Harlov, while he himself sank on to the settle, and seemed to fall into a doze, shutting his eyes and even beginning to snore. END
BEGIN NOW I gazed at him without speaking, with ever fresh wonder; he was a perfect mountain&mdash;there was no other word! END
BEGIN NOW Suddenly he started. END
BEGIN NOW Anna! END
BEGIN NOW he shouted, while his huge stomach rose and fell like a wave on the sea; what are you about? END
BEGIN NOW Look sharp! END
BEGIN NOW Didn't you hear me? END
BEGIN NOW Everything's ready, father; come in, I heard his daughter's voice. END
BEGIN NOW I inwardly marvelled at the rapidity with which Martin Petrovitch's behests had been carried out; and followed him into the drawing-room, where, on a table covered with a red cloth with white flowers on it, lunch was already prepared: junket, cream, wheaten bread, even powdered sugar and ginger. END
BEGIN NOW While I set to work on the junket, Martin Petrovitch growled affectionately, Eat, my friend, eat, my dear boy; don't despise our country cheer, and sitting down again in a corner, again seemed to fall into a doze. END
BEGIN NOW Before me, perfectly motionless, with downcast eyes, stood Anna Martinovna, while I saw through the window her husband walking my cob up and down the yard, and rubbing the chain of the snaffle with his own hands. END
BEGIN NOW MY mother did not like Harlov's elder daughter; she called her a stuck-up thing. END
BEGIN NOW Anna Martinovna scarcely ever came to pay us her respects, and behaved with chilly decorum in my mother's presence, though it was by her good offices she had been well educated at a boarding-school, and had been married, and on her wedding-day had received a thousand roubles and a yellow Turkish shawl, the latter, it is true, a trifle the worse for wear. END
BEGIN NOW She was a woman of medium height, thin, very brisk and rapid in her movements, with thick fair hair and a handsome dark face, on which the pale-blue narrow eyes showed up in a rather strange but pleasing way. END
BEGIN NOW She had a straight thin nose, her lips were thin too, and her chin was like the loop-end of a hair-pin. END
BEGIN NOW No one looking at her could fail to think: Well, you are a clever creature&mdash;and a spiteful one, too! END
BEGIN NOW And for all that, there was something attractive about her too. END
BEGIN NOW Even the dark moles, scattered like buck-wheat over her face, suited her and increased the feeling she inspired. END
BEGIN NOW Her hands thrust into her kerchief, she was slily watching me, looking downwards (I was seated, while she was standing). END
BEGIN NOW A wicked little smile strayed about her lips and her cheeks and in the shadow of her long eyelashes. END
BEGIN NOW Ugh, you pampered little fine gentleman! END
BEGIN NOW this smile seemed to express. END
BEGIN NOW Every time she drew a breath, her nostrils slightly distended&mdash;this, too, was rather strange. END
BEGIN NOW But all the same, it seemed to me that were Anna Martinovna to love me, or even to care to kiss me with her thin cruel lips, I should simply bound up to the ceiling with delight. END
BEGIN NOW I knew she was very severe and exacting, that the peasant women and girls went in terror of her&mdash;but what of that? END
BEGIN NOW Anna Martinovna secretly excited my imagination\. END
BEGIN NOW though after all, I was only fifteen then,&mdash;and at that age!\. END
BEGIN NOW Martin Petrovitch roused himself again. END
BEGIN NOW Anna! END
BEGIN NOW he shouted, you ought to strum something on the pianoforte\. END
BEGIN NOW young gentlemen are fond of that. END
BEGIN NOW I looked round; there was a pitiful semblance of a piano in the room. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, father, responded Anna Martinovna. END
BEGIN NOW Only what am I to play the young gentleman? END
BEGIN NOW He won't find it interesting. END
BEGIN NOW Why, what did they teach you at your young ladies' seminary? END
BEGIN NOW I've forgotten everything&mdash;besides, the notes are broken. END
BEGIN NOW Anna Martinovna' s voice was very pleasant, resonant and rather plaintive&mdash;like the note of some birds of prey. END
BEGIN NOW Very well, said Martin Petrovitch, and he lapsed into dreaminess again. END
BEGIN NOW Well, he began once more, wouldn't you like, then, to see the threshing-floor, and have a look round? END
BEGIN NOW Volodka will escort you.&mdash;Hi, Volodka! END
BEGIN NOW he shouted to his son-in-law, who was still pacing up and down the yard with my horse, take the young gentleman to the threshing-floor.\. END
BEGIN NOW and show him my farming generally. END
BEGIN NOW But I must have a nap! END
BEGIN NOW So! END
BEGIN NOW good-bye! END
BEGIN NOW He went out and I after him. END
BEGIN NOW Anna Martinovna at once set to work rapidly, and, as it were, angrily, clearing the table. END
BEGIN NOW In the doorway, I turned and bowed to her. END
BEGIN NOW But she seemed not to notice my bow, and only smiled again, more maliciously than before. END
BEGIN NOW I took my horse from Harlov's son-in-law and led him by the bridle. END
BEGIN NOW We went together to the threshing-floor, but as we discovered nothing very remarkable about it, and as he could not suppose any great interest in farming in a young lad like me, we returned through the garden to the main road. END
BEGIN NOW I WAS well acquainted with Harlov's son-in-law. END
BEGIN NOW His name was Vladimir Vassilievitch Sletkin. END
BEGIN NOW He was an orphan, brought up by my mother, and the son of a petty official, to whom she had intrusted some business. END
BEGIN NOW He had first been placed in the district school, then he had entered the seignorial counting-house, then he had been put into the service of the government stores, and, finally, married to the daughter of Martin Petrovitch. END
BEGIN NOW My mother used to call him a little Jew, and certainly, with his curly hair, his black eyes always moist, like damson jam, his hook nose, and wide red mouth, he did suggest the Jewish type. END
BEGIN NOW But the colour of his skin was white and he was altogether very good-looking. END
BEGIN NOW He was of a most obliging temper, so long as his personal advantage was not involved. END
BEGIN NOW Then he promptly lost all self-control from greediness, and was moved even to tears. END
BEGIN NOW He was ready to whine the whole day long to gain the paltriest trifle; he would remind one a hundred times over of a promise, and be hurt and complain if it were not carried out at once. END
BEGIN NOW He liked sauntering about the fields with a gun; and when he happened to get a hare or a wild duck, he would thrust his booty into his game-bag with peculiar zest, saying, Now, you may be as tricky as you like, you won't escape me! END
BEGIN NOW Now you're mine! END
BEGIN NOW You've a good horse, he began in his lisping voice, as he assisted me to get into the saddle; I ought to have a horse like that! END
BEGIN NOW But where can I get one? END
BEGIN NOW I've no such luck. END
BEGIN NOW If you'd ask your mamma, now&mdash;remind her. END
BEGIN NOW Why, has she promised you one? END
BEGIN NOW Promised? END
BEGIN NOW No; but I thought that in her great kindness&mdash;- You should apply to Martin Petrovitch. END
BEGIN NOW To Martin Petrovitch? END
BEGIN NOW Sletkin repeated, dwelling on each syllable. END
BEGIN NOW To him I'm no better than a worthless page, like Maximka, He keeps a tight hand on us, that he does, and you get nothing from him for all your toil. END
BEGIN NOW Really? END
BEGIN NOW Yes, by God. END
BEGIN NOW He'll say, 'My word's sacred! END
BEGIN NOW '&mdash;and there, it's as though he's chopped it off with an axe. END
BEGIN NOW You may beg or not, it's all one. END
BEGIN NOW Besides, Anna Martinovna, my wife, is not in such favour with him as Evlampia Martinovna. END
BEGIN NOW O merciful God, bless us and save us! END
BEGIN NOW he suddenly interrupted himself, flinging up his hands in despair. END
BEGIN NOW Look! END
BEGIN NOW what's that? END
BEGIN NOW A whole half-rood of oats, our oats, some wretch has gone and cut. END
BEGIN NOW The villain! END
BEGIN NOW Just see! END
BEGIN NOW Thieves! END
BEGIN NOW thieves! END
BEGIN NOW It's a true saying, to be sure, don't trust Eskovo, Beskovo, Erino, and Byelino! END
BEGIN NOW (these were the names of four villages near). END
BEGIN NOW Ah, ah, what a thing! END
BEGIN NOW A rouble and a half's worth, or, maybe, two roubles, loss! END
BEGIN NOW In Sletkin's voice, one could almost hear sobs. END
BEGIN NOW I gave my horse a poke in the ribs and rode away from him. END
BEGIN NOW Sletkin's ejaculations still reached my hearing, when suddenly at a turn in the road, I came upon the second daughter of Harlov, Evlampia, who had, in the words of Anna Martinovna, gone into the fields to get cornflowers. END
BEGIN NOW A thick wreath of those flowers was twined about her head. END
BEGIN NOW We exchanged bows in silence. END
BEGIN NOW Evlampia, too, was very good-looking; as much so as her sister, though in a different style. END
BEGIN NOW She was tall and stoutly built; everything about her was on a large scale: her head, and her feet and hands, and her snow-white teeth, and especially her eyes, prominent, languishing eyes, of the dark blue of glass beads. END
BEGIN NOW Everything about her, while still beautiful, had positively a monumental character (she was a true daughter of Martin Petrovitch). END
BEGIN NOW She did not, it seemed, know what to do with her massive fair mane, and she had twisted it in three plaits round her head. END
BEGIN NOW Her mouth was charming, crimson and fresh as a rose, and as she talked her upper lip was lifted in the middle in a very fascinating way. END
BEGIN NOW But there was something wild and almost fierce in the glance of her huge eyes. END
BEGIN NOW A free bird, wild Cossack breed, so Martin Petrovitch used to speak of her. END
BEGIN NOW I was in awe of her.\. END
BEGIN NOW This stately beauty reminded one of her father. END
BEGIN NOW I rode on a little farther and heard her singing in a strong, even, rather harsh voice, a regular peasant voice; suddenly she ceased. END
BEGIN NOW I looked round and from the crest of the hill saw her standing beside Harlov's son-in-law facing the rood of oats. END
BEGIN NOW The latter was gesticulating and pointing, but she stood without stirring. END
BEGIN NOW The sun lighted up her tall figure, and the wreath of cornflowers shone brilliantly blue on her head. END
BEGIN NOW I BELIEVE I have already mentioned that, for this second daughter of Harlov's too, my mother had already prepared a match. END
BEGIN NOW This was one of the poorest of our neighbours, a retired army major, Gavrila Fedulitch Zhitkov, a man no longer young, and, as he himself expressed it, not without a certain complacency, however, as though recommending himself, battered and broken down. END
BEGIN NOW He could barely read and write, and was exceedingly stupid, but secretly aspired to become my mother's steward, as he felt himself to be a man of action. END
BEGIN NOW I can warm the peasant's hides for them, if I can do anything, he used to say, almost gnashing his own teeth, because I was used to it, he used to explain, in my former duties, I mean. END
BEGIN NOW Had Zhitkov been less of a fool, he would have realised that he had not the slightest chance of being steward to my mother, seeing that, for that, it would have been necessary to get rid of the present steward, one Kvitsinsky, a very capable Pole of great character, in whom my mother had the fullest confidence. END
BEGIN NOW Zhitkov had a long face, like a horse's; it was all overgrown with hair of a dusty whitish colour; his cheeks were covered with it right up to the eyes; and even in the severest frosts, it was sprinkled with an abundant sweat, like drops of dew. END
BEGIN NOW At the sight of my mother, he drew himself upright as a post, his head positively quivered with zeal, his huge hands slapped a little against his thighs, and his whole person seemed to express: Command!\. END
BEGIN NOW and I will strive my utmost! END
BEGIN NOW My mother was under no illusion on the score of his abilities, which did not, however, hinder her from taking steps to marry him to Evlampia. END
BEGIN NOW Only, will you be able to manage her, my good sir? END
BEGIN NOW she asked him one day. END
BEGIN NOW Zhitkov smiled complacently. END
BEGIN NOW Upon my word, Natalia Nikolaevna! END
BEGIN NOW I used to keep a whole regiment in order; they were tame enough in my hands; and what's this? END
BEGIN NOW A trumpery business! END
BEGIN NOW A regiment's one thing, sir, but a well-bred girl, a wife, is a very different matter, my mother observed with displeasure. END
BEGIN NOW Upon my word, ma'am! END
BEGIN NOW Natalia Nikolaevna! END
BEGIN NOW Zhitkov cried again, that we're quite able to understand. END
BEGIN NOW In one word: a young lady, a delicate person! END
BEGIN NOW Well! END
BEGIN NOW my mother decided at length, Evlampia won't let herself be trampled upon. END
BEGIN NOW ONE day&mdash;it was the month of June, and evening was coming on&mdash;a servant announced the arrival of Martin Petrovitch. END
BEGIN NOW My mother was surprised: we had not seen him for over a week, but he had never visited us so late before. END
BEGIN NOW Something has happened! END
BEGIN NOW she exclaimed in an undertone. END
BEGIN NOW The face of Martin Petrovitch, when he rolled into the room and at once sank into a chair near the door, wore such an unusual expression, it was so preoccupied and positively pale, that my mother involuntarily repeated her exclamation aloud. END
BEGIN NOW Martin Petrovitch fixed his little eyes upon her, was silent for a space, sighed heavily, was silent again, and articulated at last that he had come about something.\. END
BEGIN NOW which.\. END
BEGIN NOW was of a kind, that on account of.\. END
BEGIN NOW Muttering these disconnected words, he suddenly got up and went out. END
BEGIN NOW My mother rang, ordered the footman, who appeared, to overtake Martin Petrovitch at once and bring him back without fail, but the latter had already had time to get into his droshky and drive away. END
BEGIN NOW Next morning my mother, who was astonished and even alarmed, as much by Martin Petrovitch's strange behaviour as by the extraordinary expression of his face, was on the point of sending a special messenger to him, when he made his appearance. END
BEGIN NOW This time he seemed more composed. END
BEGIN NOW Tell me, my good friend, tell me, cried my mother, directly she saw him, what ever has happened to you? END
BEGIN NOW I thought yesterday, upon my word I did Mercy on us! END
BEGIN NOW I thought, 'Hasn't our old friend gone right off his head?' END
BEGIN NOW I've not gone off my head, madam, answered Martin Petrovitch; I'm not that sort of man. END
BEGIN NOW But I want to consult with you. END
BEGIN NOW What about? END
BEGIN NOW I'm only in doubt, whether it will be agreeable to you in this same contingency&mdash;- Speak away, speak away, my good sir, but more simply. END
BEGIN NOW Don't alarm me! END
BEGIN NOW What's this same contingency? END
BEGIN NOW Speak more plainly. END
BEGIN NOW Or is it your melancholy come upon you again? END
BEGIN NOW Harlov scowled. END
BEGIN NOW No, it's not melancholy&mdash;that comes upon me in the new moon; but allow me to ask you, madam, what do you think about death? END
BEGIN NOW My mother was taken aback. END
BEGIN NOW About what? END
BEGIN NOW About death. END
BEGIN NOW Can death spare any one whatever in this world? END
BEGIN NOW What have you got in your head, my good friend? END
BEGIN NOW Who of us is immortal? END
BEGIN NOW For all you're born a giant, even to you there'll be an end in time. END
BEGIN NOW There will! END
BEGIN NOW oh, there will! END
BEGIN NOW Harlov assented and he looked downcast. END
BEGIN NOW I've had a vision come to me in my dreams, he brought out at last. END
BEGIN NOW What are you saying? END
BEGIN NOW my mother interrupted him. END
BEGIN NOW A vision in my dreams, he repeated&mdash; I'm a seer of visions, you know! END
BEGIN NOW You! END
BEGIN NOW I. END
BEGIN NOW Didn't you know it? END
BEGIN NOW Harlov sighed. END
BEGIN NOW Well, so.\. END
BEGIN NOW Over a week ago, madam, I lay down, on the very last day of eating meat before St. Peter's fast-day; I lay down after dinner to rest a bit, well, and so I fell asleep, and dreamed a raven colt ran into the room to me. END
BEGIN NOW And this colt began sporting about and grinning. END
BEGIN NOW Black as a beetle was the raven colt. END
BEGIN NOW Harlov ceased. END
BEGIN NOW Well? END
BEGIN NOW said my mother. END
BEGIN NOW And all of a sudden this same colt turns round, and gives me a kick in the left elbow, right in the funny bone.\. END
BEGIN NOW I waked up; my arm would not move nor my leg either. END
BEGIN NOW Well, thinks I, it's paralysis; however, I worked them up and down, and got them to move again; only there were shooting pains in the joints a long time, and there are still. END
BEGIN NOW When I open my hand, the pains shoot through the joints. END
BEGIN NOW Why, Martin Petrovitch, you must have lain upon your arm somehow and crushed it. END
BEGIN NOW No, madam; pray, don't talk like that! END
BEGIN NOW It was an intimation\. END
BEGIN NOW referring to my death, I mean. END
BEGIN NOW Well, upon my word, my mother was beginning. END
BEGIN NOW An intimation. END
BEGIN NOW Prepare thyself man, as 'twere to say. END
BEGIN NOW And therefore, madam, here is what I have to announce to you, without a moment's delay. END
BEGIN NOW Not wishing, Harlov suddenly began shouting, that the same death should come upon me, the servant of God, unawares, I have planned in my own mind this: to divide&mdash;now during my lifetime&mdash;my estate between my two daughters, Anna and Evlampia, according as God Almighty directs me&mdash; Martin Petrovitch stopped, groaned, and added, without a moment's delay. END
BEGIN NOW Well, that would be a good idea, observed my mother; though I think you have no need to be in a hurry. END
BEGIN NOW And seeing that herein I desire, Harlov continued, raising his voice still higher, to be observant of all due order and legality, so humbly beg your young son, Dmitri Semyonovitch&mdash;I would not venture, madam, to trouble you&mdash;I beg the said Dmitri Semyonovitch, your son, and I claim of my kinsman, Bitchkov, as a plain duty, to assist at the ratification of the formal act and transference of possession to my two daughters&mdash;Anna, married, and Evlampia, spinster. END
BEGIN NOW Which act will be drawn up in readiness the day after to-morrow at twelve o'clock, at my own place, Eskovo, also called Kozulkino, in the presence of the ruling authorities and functionaries, who are thereto invited. END
BEGIN NOW Martin Petrovitch with difficulty reached the end of this speech, which he had obviously learnt by heart, and which was interspersed with frequent sighs.\. END
BEGIN NOW He seemed to have no breath left in his chest; his pale face was crimson again, and he several times wiped the sweat off it. END
BEGIN NOW So you've already composed the deed dividing your property? END
BEGIN NOW my mother queried. END
BEGIN NOW When did you manage that? END
BEGIN NOW I managed it\. END
BEGIN NOW oh! END
BEGIN NOW Neither eating, nor drinking&mdash;- Did you write it yourself? END
BEGIN NOW Volodka\. END
BEGIN NOW oh! END
BEGIN NOW helped. END
BEGIN NOW And have you forwarded a petition? END
BEGIN NOW I have, and the chamber has sanctioned it, and notice has been given to the district court, and the temporary division of the local court has\. END
BEGIN NOW oh!\. END
BEGIN NOW been notified to be present. END
BEGIN NOW My mother laughed. END
BEGIN NOW I see, Martin Petrovitch, you've made every arrangement already&mdash;and how quickly. END
BEGIN NOW You've not spared money, I should say? END
BEGIN NOW No, indeed, madam. END
BEGIN NOW Well, well. END
BEGIN NOW And you say you want to consult with me. END
BEGIN NOW Well, my little Dmitri can go; and I'll send Souvenir with him, and speak to Kvitsinsky.\. END
BEGIN NOW But you haven't invited Gavrila Fedulitch? END
BEGIN NOW Gavrila Fedulitch&mdash;Mr. Zhitkov&mdash;has had notice\. END
BEGIN NOW from me also. END
BEGIN NOW As a betrothed, it was only fitting. END
BEGIN NOW Martin Petrovitch had obviously exhausted all the resources of his eloquence. END
BEGIN NOW Besides, it always seemed to me that he did not look altogether favourably on the match my mother had made for his daughter; possibly, he had expected a more advantageous marriage for his darling Evlampia. END
BEGIN NOW He got up from his chair, and made a scrape with his foot. END
BEGIN NOW Thank you for your consent. END
BEGIN NOW Where are you off to? END
BEGIN NOW asked my mother. END
BEGIN NOW Stay a bit; I'll order some lunch to be served you. END
BEGIN NOW Much obliged, responded Harlov. END
BEGIN NOW But I cannot.\. END
BEGIN NOW Oh! END
BEGIN NOW I must get home. END
BEGIN NOW He backed and was about to move sideways, as his habit was, through the door. END
BEGIN NOW Stop, stop a minute, my mother went on. END
BEGIN NOW Can you possibly mean to make over the whole of your property without reserve to your daughters? END
BEGIN NOW Certainly, without reserve. END
BEGIN NOW Well, but how about yourself&mdash;where are you going to live? END
BEGIN NOW Harlov positively flung up his hands in amazement. END
BEGIN NOW You ask where? END
BEGIN NOW In my house, at home, as I've lived hitherto\. END
BEGIN NOW so hence-forward. END
BEGIN NOW Whatever difference could there be? END
BEGIN NOW You have such confidence in your daughters and your son-in-law, then? END
BEGIN NOW Were you pleased to speak of Volodka? END
BEGIN NOW A poor stick like him? END
BEGIN NOW Why, I can do as I like with him, whatever it is\. END
BEGIN NOW what authority has he? END
BEGIN NOW As for them, my daughters, that is, to care for me till I'm in the grave, to give me meat and drink, and clothe me.\. END
BEGIN NOW Merciful heavens! END
BEGIN NOW it's their first duty. END
BEGIN NOW I shall not long be an eyesore to them. END
BEGIN NOW Death's not over the hills&mdash;it's upon my shoulders. END
BEGIN NOW Death is in God's hands, observed my mother; though that is their duty, to be sure. END
BEGIN NOW Only pardon me, Martin Petrovitch; your elder girl, Anna, is well known to be proud and imperious, and&mdash;well&mdash;the second has a fierce look.\. END
BEGIN NOW Natalia Nikolaevna! END
BEGIN NOW Harlov broke in, why do you say that?\. END
BEGIN NOW Why, as though they\. END
BEGIN NOW My daughters\. END
BEGIN NOW Why, as though I\. END
BEGIN NOW Forget their duty? END
BEGIN NOW Never in their wildest dreams\. END
BEGIN NOW Offer opposition? END
BEGIN NOW To whom? END
BEGIN NOW Their parent\. END
BEGIN NOW Dare to do such a thing? END
BEGIN NOW Have they not my curse to fear? END
BEGIN NOW They've passed their life long in fear and in submission&mdash;and all of a sudden\. END
BEGIN NOW Good Lord! END
BEGIN NOW Harlov choked, there was a rattle in his throat. END
BEGIN NOW Very well, very well, my mother made haste to soothe him; only I don't understand all the same what has put it into your head to divide the property up now. END
BEGIN NOW It would have come to them afterwards, in any case. END
BEGIN NOW I imagine it's your melancholy that's at the bottom of it all. END
BEGIN NOW Eh, ma'am, Harlov rejoined, not without vexation, you will keep coming back to that. END
BEGIN NOW There is, maybe, a higher power at work in this, and you talk of melancholy. END
BEGIN NOW I thought to do this, madam, because in my own person, while still in life, I wish to decide in my presence, who is to possess what, and with what I will reward each, so that they may possess, and feel thankfulness, and carry out my wishes, and what their father and benefactor has resolved upon, they may accept as a bountiful gift. END
BEGIN NOW Harlov's voice broke again. END
BEGIN NOW Come, that's enough, that's enough, my good friend, my mother cut him short; or your raven colt will be putting in an appearance in earnest. END
BEGIN NOW O Natalia Nikolaevna, don't talk to me of it, groaned Harlov. END
BEGIN NOW That's my death come after me. END
BEGIN NOW Forgive my intrusion. END
BEGIN NOW And you, my little sir, I shall have the honour of expecting you the day after to-morrow. END
BEGIN NOW Martin Petrovitch went out; my mother looked after him, and shook her head significantly. END
BEGIN NOW This is a bad business, she murmured, a bad business. END
BEGIN NOW You noticed &mdash;she addressed herself to me&mdash; he talked, and all the while seemed blinking, as though the sun were in his eyes; that's a bad sign. END
BEGIN NOW When a man's like that, his heart's sure to be heavy, and misfortune threatens him. END
BEGIN NOW You must go over the day after to-morrow with Vikenty Osipovitch and Souvenir. END
BEGIN NOW ON the day appointed, our big family coach, with seats for four, harnessed with six bay horses, and with the head coachman, the grey-bearded and portly Alexeitch, on the box, rolled smoothly up to the steps of our house. END
BEGIN NOW The importance of the act upon which Harlov was about to enter, and the solemnity with which he had invited us, had had their effect on my mother. END
BEGIN NOW She had herself given orders for this extraordinary state equipage to be brought out, and had directed Souvenir and me to put on our best clothes. END
BEGIN NOW She obviously wished to show respect to her protégé. END
BEGIN NOW As for Kvitsinsky, he always wore a frockcoat and white tie. END
BEGIN NOW Souvenir chattered like a magpie all the way, giggled, wondered whether his brother would apportion him anything, and thereupon called him a dummy and an old fogey. END
BEGIN NOW Kvitsinsky, a man of severe and bilious temperament, could not put up with it at last. END
BEGIN NOW What can induce you, he observed, in his distinct Polish accent, to keep up such a continual unseemly chatter? END
BEGIN NOW Can you really be incapable of sitting quiet without these 'wholly superfluous' (his favourite phrase) inanities? END
BEGIN NOW All right, d'rectly, Souvenir muttered discontentedly, and he fixed his squinting eyes on the carriage window. END
BEGIN NOW A quarter of an hour had not passed, the smoothly trotting horses had scarcely begun to get warm under the straps of their new harness, when Harlov's homestead came into sight. END
BEGIN NOW Through the widely open gate, our coach rolled into the yard. END
BEGIN NOW The diminutive postillion, whose legs hardly reached halfway down his horses' body, for the last time leaped up with a babyish shriek into the soft saddle, old Alexeitch at once spread out and raised his elbows, a slight wo-o was heard, and we stopped. END
BEGIN NOW The dogs did not bark to greet us, and the serf boys, in long smocks that gaped open over their big stomachs, had all hidden themselves. END
BEGIN NOW Harlov's son-in-law was awaiting us in the doorway. END
BEGIN NOW I remember I was particularly struck by the birch boughs stuck in on both sides of the steps, as though it were Trinity Sunday. END
BEGIN NOW Grandeur upon grandeur, Souvenir, who was the first to alight, squeaked through his nose. END
BEGIN NOW And certainly there was a solemn air about everything. END
BEGIN NOW Harlov's son-in-law was wearing a plush cravat with a satin bow, and an extraordinarily tight tail-coat; while Maximka, who popped out behind his back, had his hair so saturated with kvas, that it positively dripped. END
BEGIN NOW We went into the parlour, and saw Martin Petrovitch towering&mdash;yes, positively towering&mdash;motionless, in the middle of the room. END
BEGIN NOW I don't know what Souvenir's and Kvitsinsky's feelings were at the sight of his colossal figure; but I felt something akin to awe. END
BEGIN NOW Martin Petrovitch was attired in a grey Cossack coat&mdash;his militia uniform of it must have been&mdash;with a black stand-up collar. END
BEGIN NOW A bronze medal was to be seen on his breast, a sabre hung at his side; he laid his left hand on the hilt, with his right he was leaning on the table, which was covered with a red cloth. END
BEGIN NOW Two sheets of paper, full of writing, lay on the table. END
BEGIN NOW Harlov stood motionless, not even gasping; and what dignity was expressed in his attitude, what confidence in himself, in his unlimited and unquestionable power! END
BEGIN NOW He barely greeted us with a motion of the head, and barely articulating Be seated! END
BEGIN NOW pointed the forefinger of his left hand in the direction of some chairs set in a row. END
BEGIN NOW Against the right-hand wall of the parlour were standing Harlov's daughters wearing their Sunday clothes: Anna, in a shot lilac-green dress, with a yellow silk sash; Evlampia, in pink, with crimson ribbons. END
BEGIN NOW Near them stood Zhitkov, in a new uniform, with the habitual expression of dull and greedy expectation in his eyes, and with a greater profusion of sweat than usual over his hirsute countenance. END
BEGIN NOW On the left side of the room sat the priest, in a threadbare snuff-coloured cassock, an old man, with rough brown hair. END
BEGIN NOW This head of hair, and the dejected lack-lustre eyes, and the big wrinkled hands, which seemed a burden even to himself, and lay like two rocks on his knees, and the tarred boots which peeped out beneath his cassock, all seemed to tell of a joyless laborious life. END
BEGIN NOW His parish was a very poor one. END
BEGIN NOW Beside him was the local police captain, a fattish, palish, dirty-looking little gentleman, with soft puffy little hands and feet, black eyes, black short-clipped moustaches, a continual cheerful but yet sickly little smile on his face. END
BEGIN NOW He had the reputation of being a great taker of bribes, and even a tyrant, as the expression was in those days. END
BEGIN NOW But not only the gentry, even the peasants were used to him, and liked him. END
BEGIN NOW He bent very free and easy and rather ironical looks around him; it was clear that all this procedure amused him. END
BEGIN NOW In reality, the only part that had any interest for him was the light lunch and spirits in store for us. END
BEGIN NOW But the attorney sitting near him, a lean man with a long face, narrow whiskers from his ears to his nose, as they were worn in the days of Alexander the First, was absorbed with his whole soul in Martin Petrovitch's proceedings, and never took his big serious eyes off him. END
BEGIN NOW In his concentrated attention and sympathy, he kept moving and twisting his lips, though without opening his mouth. END
BEGIN NOW Souvenir stationed himself next him, and began talking to him in a whisper, after first informing me that he was the chief freemason in the province. END
BEGIN NOW The temporary division of the local court consists, as every one knows, of the police captain, the attorney, and the rural police commissioner; but the latter was either absent or kept himself in the background, so that I did not notice him. END
BEGIN NOW He bore, however, the nickname the non-existent among us in the district, just as there are tramps called the non-identified. END
BEGIN NOW I sat next Souvenir, Kvitsinsky next me. END
BEGIN NOW The face of the practical Pole showed unmistakeable annoyance at our wholly superfluous expedition, and unnecessary waste of time.\. END
BEGIN NOW A grand lady's caprices! END
BEGIN NOW these Russian grandees' fancies! END
BEGIN NOW he seemed to be murmuring to himself.\. END
BEGIN NOW Ugh, these Russians! END
BEGIN NOW WHEN we were all seated, Martin Petrovitch hunched his shoulders, cleared his throat, scanned us all with his bear-like little eyes, and with a noisy sigh began as follows: Gentlemen, I have called you together for the following purpose. END
BEGIN NOW I am grown old, gentlemen, and overcome by infirmities.\. END
BEGIN NOW Already I have had an intimation, the hour of death steals on, like a thief in the night.\. END
BEGIN NOW Isn't that so, father? END
BEGIN NOW he addressed the priest. END
BEGIN NOW The priest started. END
BEGIN NOW Quite so, quite so, he mumbled, his beard shaking. END
BEGIN NOW And therefore, continued Martin Petrovitch, suddenly raising his voice, not wishing the said death to come upon me unawares, I purposed\. END
BEGIN NOW Martin Petrovitch proceeded to repeat, word for word, the speech he had made to my mother two days before. END
BEGIN NOW In accordance with this my determination, he shouted louder than ever, this deed (he struck his hand on the papers lying on the table) has been drawn up by me, and the presiding authorities have been invited by me, and wherein my will consists the following points will treat. END
BEGIN NOW I have ruled, my day is over! END
BEGIN NOW Martin Petrovitch put his round iron spectacles on his nose, took one of the written sheets from the table, and began: Deed of partition of the estate of the retired non-commissioned officer and nobleman, Martin Harlov, drawn up by himself in his full and right understanding, and by his own good judgment, and wherein is precisely defined what benefits are assigned to his two daughters, Anna and Evlampia&mdash;bow! END
BEGIN NOW &mdash;(they bowed), and in what way the serfs and other property, and live stock, be apportioned between the said daughters! END
BEGIN NOW Under my hand! END
BEGIN NOW This is their document! END
BEGIN NOW the police-captain whispered to Kvitsinsky, with his invariable smile, they want to read it for the beauty of the style, but the legal deed is made out formally, without all these flourishes. END
BEGIN NOW Souvenir was beginning to snigger.\. END
BEGIN NOW In accordance with my will, put in Harlov, who had caught the police captain's remark. END
BEGIN NOW In accordance in every point, the latter hastened to respond cheerfully; only, as you're aware, Martin Petrovitch, there's no dispensing with formality. END
BEGIN NOW And unnecessary details have been removed. END
BEGIN NOW For the chamber can't enter into the question of spotted cows and fancy drakes. END
BEGIN NOW Come here! END
BEGIN NOW boomed Harlov to his son-in-law, who had come into the room behind us, and remained standing with an obsequious air near the door. END
BEGIN NOW He skipped up to his father-in-law at once. END
BEGIN NOW There, take it and read! END
BEGIN NOW It's hard for me. END
BEGIN NOW Only mind and don't mumble it! END
BEGIN NOW Let all the gentlemen present be able to understand it. END
BEGIN NOW Sletkin took the paper in both hands, and began timidly, but distinctly, and with taste and feeling, to read the deed of partition. END
BEGIN NOW There was set forth in it with the greatest accuracy just what was assigned to Anna and what to Evlampia, and how the division was to be made. END
BEGIN NOW Harlov from time to time interspersed the reading with phrases. END
BEGIN NOW Do you hear, that's for you, Anna, for your zeal! END
BEGIN NOW or, That I give you, Evlampia! END
BEGIN NOW and both the sisters bowed, Anna from the waist, Evlampia simply with a motion of the head. END
BEGIN NOW Harlov looked at them with stern dignity. END
BEGIN NOW The farm house (the little new building) was assigned by him to Evlampia, as the younger daughter, by the well-known custom. END
BEGIN NOW The reader's voice quivered and resounded at these words, unfavourable for himself; while Zhitkov licked his lips. END
BEGIN NOW Evlampia gave him a sidelong glance; had I been in Zhitkov's shoes, I should not have liked that glance. END
BEGIN NOW The scornful expression, characteristic of Evlampia, as of every genuine Russian beauty, had a peculiar shade at that moment. END
BEGIN NOW For himself, Martin Petrovitch reserved the right to go on living in the rooms he occupied, and assigned to himself, under the name of rations, a full allowance of normal provisions, and ten roubles a month for clothes. END
BEGIN NOW The last phrase of the deed Harlov wished to read himself. END
BEGIN NOW And this my parental will, it ran, to carry out and observe is a sacred and binding duty on my daughters, seeing it is a command; seeing that I am, after God, their father and head, and am not bounden to render an account to any, nor have so rendered. END
BEGIN NOW And do they carry out my will, so will my fatherly blessing be with them, but should they not so do, which God forbid, then will they be overtaken by my paternal curse that cannot be averted, now and for ever, amen! END
BEGIN NOW Harlov raised the deed high above his head. END
BEGIN NOW Anna at once dropped on her knees and touched the ground with her forehead; her husband, too, doubled up after her. END
BEGIN NOW Well, and you? END
BEGIN NOW Harlov turned to Evlampia. END
BEGIN NOW She crimsoned all over, and she too bowed to the earth; Zhitkov bent his whole carcase forward. END
BEGIN NOW Sign! END
BEGIN NOW cried Harlov, pointing his forefinger to the bottom of the deed. END
BEGIN NOW Here: 'I thank and accept, Anna. END
BEGIN NOW I thank and accept, Evlampia!' END
BEGIN NOW Both daughters rose, and signed one after another. END
BEGIN NOW Sletkin rose too, and was feeling after the pen, but Harlov moved him aside, sticking his middle finger into his cravat, so that he gasped. END
BEGIN NOW The silence lasted a moment. END
BEGIN NOW Suddenly Martin Petrovitch gave a sort of sob, and muttering, Well, now it's all yours! END
BEGIN NOW moved away. END
BEGIN NOW His daughters and son-in-law looked at one another, went up to him and began kissing him just above his elbow. END
BEGIN NOW His shoulder they could not reach. END
BEGIN NOW THE police captain read the real formal document, the deed of gift, drawn up by Martin Petrovitch. END
BEGIN NOW Then he went out on to the steps with the attorney and explained what had taken place to the crowd assembled at the gates, consisting of the witnesses required by law and other people from the neighbourhood, Harlov's peasants, and a few house-serfs. END
BEGIN NOW Then began the ceremony of the new owners entering into possession. END
BEGIN NOW They came out, too, upon the steps, and the police captain pointed to them when, slightly scowling with one eyebrow, while his careless face assumed for an instant a threatening air, he exhorted the crowd to subordination. END
BEGIN NOW He might well have dispensed with these exhortations: a less unruly set of countenances than those of the Harlov peasants, I imagine, have never existed in creation. END
BEGIN NOW Clothed in thin smocks and torn sheepskins, but very tightly girt round their waists, as is always the peasants' way on solemn occasions, they stood motionless as though cut out of stone, and whenever the police captain uttered any exclamation such as, D'ye hear, you brutes? END
BEGIN NOW d'ye understand, you devils? END
BEGIN NOW they suddenly bowed all at once, as though at the word of command. END
BEGIN NOW Each of these brutes and devils held his cap tight in both hands, and never took his eyes off the window, where Martin Petrovitch's figure was visible. END
BEGIN NOW The witnesses themselves were hardly less awed. END
BEGIN NOW Is any impediment known to you, the police captain roared at them, against the entrance into possession of these the sole and legitimate heirs and daughters of Martin Petrovitch Harlov? END
BEGIN NOW All the witnesses seemed to huddle together at once. END
BEGIN NOW Do you know any, you devils? END
BEGIN NOW the police captain shouted again. END
BEGIN NOW We know nothing, your excellency, responded sturdily a little old man, marked with small-pox, with a clipped beard and whiskers, an old soldier. END
BEGIN NOW I say! END
BEGIN NOW Eremeitch's a bold fellow! END
BEGIN NOW the witnesses said of him as they dispersed. END
BEGIN NOW In spite of the police captain's entreaties, Harlov would not come out with his daughters on to the steps. END
BEGIN NOW My subjects will obey my will without that! END
BEGIN NOW he answered. END
BEGIN NOW Something like sadness had come over him on the completion of the conveyance. END
BEGIN NOW His face had grown pale. END
BEGIN NOW This new unprecedented expression of sadness looked so out of place on Martin Petrovitch's broad and kindly features that I positively was at a loss what to think. END
BEGIN NOW Was an attack of melancholy coming over him? END
BEGIN NOW The peasants, on their side, too, were obviously puzzled. END
BEGIN NOW And no wonder! END
BEGIN NOW The master's alive,&mdash;there he stands, and such a master, too; Martin Petrovitch! END
BEGIN NOW And all of a sudden he won't be their owner.\. END
BEGIN NOW A queer thing! END
BEGIN NOW I don't know whether Harlov had an inkling of the notions that were straying through his subjects' heads, or whether he wanted to display his power for the last time, but he suddenly opened the little window, stuck his head out, and shouted in a voice of thunder, obedience! END
BEGIN NOW Then he slammed-to the window. END
BEGIN NOW The peasants' bewilderment was certainly not dispelled nor decreased by this proceeding. END
BEGIN NOW They became stonier than ever, and even seemed to cease looking at anything. END
BEGIN NOW The group of house-serfs (among them were two sturdy wenches, in short chintz gowns, with muscles such as one might perhaps match in Michael Angelo's Last Judgment, and one utterly decrepit old man, hoary with age and half blind, in a threadbare frieze cloak, rumoured to have been cornet-player in the days of Potemkin,&mdash;the page Maximka, Harlov had reserved for himself) this group showed more life than the peasants; at least, it moved restlessly about. END
BEGIN NOW The new mistresses themselves were very dignified in their attitude, especially Anna. END
BEGIN NOW Her thin lips tightly compressed, she looked obstinately down\. END
BEGIN NOW her stern figure augured little good to the house-serfs. END
BEGIN NOW Evlampia, too, did not raise her eyes; only once she turned round and deliberately, as it were with surprise, scanned her betrothed, Zhitkov, who had thought fit, following Sletkin, to come out, too, on to the steps. END
BEGIN NOW What business have you here? END
BEGIN NOW those handsome prominent eyes seemed to demand. END
BEGIN NOW Sletkin was the most changed of all. END
BEGIN NOW A bustling cheeriness showed itself in his whole bearing, as though he were overtaken by hunger; the movements of his head and his legs were as obsequious as ever, but how gleefully he kept working his arms, how fussily he twitched his shoulder-blades. END
BEGIN NOW Arrived at last! END
BEGIN NOW he seemed to say. END
BEGIN NOW Having finished the ceremony of the entrance into possession, the police captain, whose mouth was literally watering at the prospect of lunch, rubbed his hands in that peculiar manner which usually precedes the tossing-off of the first glass of spirits. END
BEGIN NOW But it appeared that Martin Petrovitch wished first to have a service performed with sprinklings of holy water. END
BEGIN NOW The priest put on an ancient and decrepit chasuble; a decrepit deacon came out of the kitchen, with difficulty kindling the incense in an old brazen church-vessel. END
BEGIN NOW The service began. END
BEGIN NOW Harlov sighed continually; he was unable, owing to his corpulence, to bow to the ground, but crossing himself with his right hand and bending his head, he pointed with the forefinger of his left hand to the floor. END
BEGIN NOW Sletkin positively beamed and even shed tears. END
BEGIN NOW Zhitkov, with dignity, in martial fashion, flourished his fingers only slightly between the third and fourth button of his uniform. END
BEGIN NOW Kvitsinsky, as a Catholic, remained in the next room. END
BEGIN NOW But the attorney prayed so fervently, sighed so sympathetically after Martin Petrovitch, and so persistently muttered and chewed his lips, turning his eyes upwards, that I felt moved, as I looked at him, and began to pray fervently too. END
BEGIN NOW At the conclusion of the service and the sprinkling with holy water, during which every one present, even the blind cornet-player, the contemporary of Potemkin, even Kvitsinsky, moistened their eyes with holy water, Anna and Evlampia once more, at Martin Petrovitch's bidding, prostrated themselves to the ground to thank him. END
BEGIN NOW Then at last came the moment of lunch. END
BEGIN NOW There were a great many dishes and all very nice; we all ate terribly much. END
BEGIN NOW The inevitable bottle of Don wine made its appearance. END
BEGIN NOW The police captain, who was of all of us the most familiar with the usages of the world, and besides, the representative of government, was the first to propose the toast to the health of the fair proprietresses! END
BEGIN NOW Then he proposed we should drink to the health of our most honoured and most generous-hearted friend, Martin Petrovitch. END
BEGIN NOW At the words most generous-hearted, Sletkin uttered a shrill little cry and ran to kiss his benefactor.\. END
BEGIN NOW There, that'll do, that'll do, muttered Harlov, as it were with annoyance, keeping him off with his elbow\. END
BEGIN NOW But at this point a not quite pleasant, as they say, incident took place. END
BEGIN NOW SOUVENIR, who had been drinking continuously ever since the beginning of luncheon, suddenly got up from his chair as red as a beetroot, and pointing his finger at Martin Petrovitch, went off into his mawkish, paltry laugh. END
BEGIN NOW Generous-hearted! END
BEGIN NOW Generous-hearted! END
BEGIN NOW he began croaking; but we shall see whether this generosity will be much to his taste when he's stripped naked, the servant of God\. END
BEGIN NOW and out in the snow, too! END
BEGIN NOW What rot are you talking, fool? END
BEGIN NOW said Harlov contemptuously. END
BEGIN NOW Fool! END
BEGIN NOW fool! END
BEGIN NOW repeated Souvenir. END
BEGIN NOW God Almighty alone knows which of us is the real fool. END
BEGIN NOW But you, brother, did my sister, your wife, to her death, and now you've done for yourself\. END
BEGIN NOW ha-ha-ha! END
BEGIN NOW How dare you insult our honoured benefactor? END
BEGIN NOW Sletkin began shrilly, and, tearing himself away from Martin Petrovitch, whose shoulder he had clutched, he flew at Souvenir. END
BEGIN NOW But let me tell you, if our benefactor desires it, we can cancel the deed this very minute! END
BEGIN NOW And yet, you'll strip him naked, and turn him out into the snow\. END
BEGIN NOW returned Souvenir, retreating behind Kvitsinsky. END
BEGIN NOW Silence! END
BEGIN NOW thundered Harlov. END
BEGIN NOW I'll pound you into a jelly! END
BEGIN NOW And you hold your tongue too, puppy! END
BEGIN NOW he turned to Sletkin; don't put in your word where you're not wanted! END
BEGIN NOW If I, Martin Petrovitch Harlov, have decided to make a deed of partition, who can cancel the same act against my will? END
BEGIN NOW Why, in the whole world there is no power.\. END
BEGIN NOW Martin Petrovitch! END
BEGIN NOW the attorney began in a mellow bass&mdash;he too had drunk a good deal, but his dignity was only increased thereby&mdash; but how if the gentleman has spoken the truth? END
BEGIN NOW You have done a generous action; to be sure, but how if&mdash;God forbid&mdash;in reality in place of fitting gratitude, some affront come of it? END
BEGIN NOW I stole a glance at both Martin Petrovitch's daughters. END
BEGIN NOW Anna's eyes were simply pinned upon the speaker, and a face more spiteful, more snake-like, and more beautiful in its very spite I had certainly never seen! END
BEGIN NOW Evlampia sat turned away, with her arms folded. END
BEGIN NOW A smile more scornful than ever curved her full, rosy lips. END
BEGIN NOW Harlov got up from his chair, opened his mouth, but apparently his tongue failed him.\. END
BEGIN NOW He suddenly brought his fist down on the table, so that everything in the room danced and rang. END
BEGIN NOW Father, Anna said hurriedly, they do not know us, and that is why they judge of us so. END
BEGIN NOW But don't, please, make yourself ill. You are angered for nothing, indeed; see, your face is, as it were, twisted awry. END
BEGIN NOW Harlov looked towards Evlampia; she did not stir, though Zhitkov, sitting beside her, gave her a poke in the side. END
BEGIN NOW Thank you, my daughter Anna, said Harlov huskily; you are a sensible girl; I rely upon you and on your husband too. END
BEGIN NOW Sletkin once more gave vent to a shrill little sound; Zhitkov expanded his chest and gave a little scrape with his foot; but Harlov did not observe his efforts. END
BEGIN NOW This dolt, he went on, with a motion of his chin in the direction of Souvenir, is pleased to get a chance to tease me; but you, my dear sir, he addressed himself to the attorney, it is not for you to pass judgment on Martin Harlov; that is something beyond you. END
BEGIN NOW Though you are a man in official position, your words are most foolish. END
BEGIN NOW Besides, the deed is done, there will be no going back from my determination.\. END
BEGIN NOW Now, I will wish you good-day, I am going away. END
BEGIN NOW I am no longer the master of this house, but a guest in it. END
BEGIN NOW Anna, do you do your best; but I will go to my own room. END
BEGIN NOW Enough! END
BEGIN NOW Martin Petrovitch turned his back on us, and, without adding another word, walked deliberately out of the room. END
BEGIN NOW This sudden withdrawal on the part of our host could not but break up the party, especially as the two hostesses also vanished not long after. END
BEGIN NOW Sletkin vainly tried to keep us. END
BEGIN NOW The police captain did not fail to blame the attorney for his uncalled-for candour. END
BEGIN NOW Couldn't help it! END
BEGIN NOW the latter responded.\. END
BEGIN NOW My conscience spoke. END
BEGIN NOW There, you see that he's a mason, Souvenir whispered to me. END
BEGIN NOW Conscience! END
BEGIN NOW retorted the police captain. END
BEGIN NOW We know all about your conscience! END
BEGIN NOW I suppose it's in your pocket, just the same as it is with us sinners! END
BEGIN NOW The priest, meanwhile, even though already on his feet, foreseeing the speedy termination of the repast, lifted mouthful after mouthful to his mouth without a pause. END
BEGIN NOW You've got a fine appetite, I see, Sletkin observed to him sharply. END
BEGIN NOW Storing up for the future, the priest responded with a meek grimace; years of hunger were expressed in that reply. END
BEGIN NOW The carriages rattled up\. END
BEGIN NOW and we separated. END
BEGIN NOW On the way home, no one hindered Souvenir's chatter and silly tricks, as Kvitsinsky had announced that he was sick of all this wholly superfluous unpleasantness, and had set off home before us on foot. END
BEGIN NOW In his place, Zhitkov took a seat in our coach. END
BEGIN NOW The retired major wore a most dissatisfied expression, and kept twitching his moustaches like a spider. END
BEGIN NOW Well, your noble Excellency, lisped Souvenir, is subordination exploded, eh? END
BEGIN NOW Wait a bit and see what will happen! END
BEGIN NOW They'll give you the sack too. END
BEGIN NOW Ah, a poor bridegroom you are, a poor bridegroom, an unlucky bridegroom! END
BEGIN NOW Souvenir was positively beside himself; while poor Zhitkov could do nothing but twitch his moustaches. END
BEGIN NOW When I got home I told my mother all I had seen. END
BEGIN NOW She heard me to the end, and shook her head several times. END
BEGIN NOW It's a bad business, was her comment. END
BEGIN NOW I don't like all these innovations! END
BEGIN NOW NEXT day Martin Petrovitch came to dinner. END
BEGIN NOW My mother congratulated him on the successful conclusion of his project. END
BEGIN NOW You are now a free man, she said, and ought to feel more at ease. END
BEGIN NOW More at ease, to be sure, madam, answered Martin Petrovitch, by no means, however, showing in the expression of his face that he really was more at ease. END
BEGIN NOW Now I can meditate upon my soul, and make ready for my last hour, as I ought. END
BEGIN NOW Well, queried my mother, and do the shooting pains still tingle in your arms? END
BEGIN NOW Harlov twice clenched and unclenched his left arm. END
BEGIN NOW They do, madam; and I've something else to tell you. END
BEGIN NOW As I begin to drop asleep, some one cries in my head, 'Take care!' END
BEGIN NOW 'Take care!' END
BEGIN NOW That's nerves, observed my mother, and she began speaking of the previous day, and referred to certain circumstances which had attended the completion of the deed of partition.\. END
BEGIN NOW To be sure, to be sure, Harlov interrupted her, there was something of the sort\. END
BEGIN NOW of no consequence. END
BEGIN NOW Only there's something I would tell you, he added, hesitating&mdash; I was not disturbed yesterday by Souvenir's silly words&mdash;even Mr. Attorney, though he's no fool&mdash;even he did not trouble me; no, it was quite another person disturbed me&mdash;- Here Harlov faltered. END
BEGIN NOW Who? END
BEGIN NOW asked my mother. END
BEGIN NOW Harlov fastened his eyes upon her: Evlampia! END
BEGIN NOW Evlampia? END
BEGIN NOW Your daughter? END
BEGIN NOW How was that? END
BEGIN NOW Upon my word, madam, she was like a stone! END
BEGIN NOW nothing but a statue! END
BEGIN NOW Can it be she has no feeling? END
BEGIN NOW Her sister, Anna&mdash;well, she was all she should be. END
BEGIN NOW She's a keen-witted creature! END
BEGIN NOW But Evlampia&mdash;why, I'd shown her&mdash;I must own&mdash;so much partiality! END
BEGIN NOW Can it be she's no feeling for me! END
BEGIN NOW It's clear I'm in a bad way; it's clear I've a feeling that I'm not long for this world, since I make over everything to them; and yet she's like a stone! END
BEGIN NOW she might at least utter a sound! END
BEGIN NOW Bows&mdash;yes, she bows, but there's no thankfulness to be seen. END
BEGIN NOW There, give over, observed my mother, we'll marry her to Gavrila Fedulitch\. END
BEGIN NOW she'll soon get softer in his hands. END
BEGIN NOW Martin Petrovitch once more looked from under his brows at my mother. END
BEGIN NOW Well, there's Gavrila Fedulitch, to be sure! END
BEGIN NOW You have confidence in him, then, madam? END
BEGIN NOW I've confidence in him. END
BEGIN NOW Very well; you should know best, to be sure. END
BEGIN NOW But Evlampia, let me tell you, is like me. END
BEGIN NOW The character is just the same. END
BEGIN NOW She has the wild Cossack blood, and her heart's like a burning coal! END
BEGIN NOW Why, do you mean to tell me you've a heart like that, my dear sir? END
BEGIN NOW Harlov made no answer. END
BEGIN NOW A brief silence followed. END
BEGIN NOW What are you going to do, Martin Petrovitch, my mother began, in what way do you mean to set about saving your soul now? END
BEGIN NOW Will you set off to Mitrophan or to Kiev, or may be you'll go to the Optin desert, as it's in the neighbourhood? END
BEGIN NOW There, they do say, there's a holy monk appeared\. END
BEGIN NOW Father Makary they call him, no one remembers any one like him! END
BEGIN NOW He sees right through all sins. END
BEGIN NOW If she really turns out an ungrateful daughter, Harlov enunciated in a husky voice, then it would be better for me, I believe, to kill her with my own hands! END
BEGIN NOW What are you saying! END
BEGIN NOW Lord, have mercy on you! END
BEGIN NOW cried my mother. END
BEGIN NOW Think what you're saying! END
BEGIN NOW There, see, what a pretty pass it's come to. END
BEGIN NOW You should have listened to me the other day when you came to consult me! END
BEGIN NOW Now, here, you'll go tormenting yourself, instead of thinking of your soul! END
BEGIN NOW You'll be tormenting yourself, and all to no purpose! END
BEGIN NOW Yes! END
BEGIN NOW Here you're complaining now, and fainthearted\. END
BEGIN NOW This reproach seemed to stab Harlov to the heart. END
BEGIN NOW All his old pride came back to him with a rush. END
BEGIN NOW He shook himself and thrust out his chin. END
BEGIN NOW I am not a man, madam, Natalia Nikolaevna, to complain or be faint-hearted, he began sullenly. END
BEGIN NOW I simply wished to reveal my feelings to you as my benefactress and a person I respect. END
BEGIN NOW But the Lord God knows (here he raised his hand high above his head) that this globe of earth may crumble to pieces before I will go back from my word, or\. END
BEGIN NOW (here he positively snorted) show a faint heart, or regret what I have done! END
BEGIN NOW I had good reasons, be sure! END
BEGIN NOW My daughters will never forget their duty, for ever and ever, amen! END
BEGIN NOW My mother stopped her ears. END
BEGIN NOW What's this for, my good sir, like a trumpet-blast! END
BEGIN NOW If you really have such faith in your family, well, praise the Lord for it! END
BEGIN NOW You've quite put my brains in a whirl! END
BEGIN NOW Martin Petrovitch begged pardon, sighed twice, and was silent. END
BEGIN NOW My mother once more referred to Kiev, the Optin desert, and Father Makary.\. END
BEGIN NOW Harlov assented, said that he must\. END
BEGIN NOW he must\. END
BEGIN NOW he would have to\. END
BEGIN NOW his soul\. END
BEGIN NOW and that was all. END
BEGIN NOW He did not regain his cheerfulness before he went away. END
BEGIN NOW From time to time he clenched and unclenched his fist, looked at his open hand, said that what he feared above everything was dying without repentance, from a stroke, and that he had made a vow to himself not to get angry, as anger vitiated his blood and drove it to his head.\. END
BEGIN NOW Besides, he had now withdrawn from everything. END
BEGIN NOW What grounds could he have for getting angry? END
BEGIN NOW Let other people trouble themselves now and vitiate their blood! END
BEGIN NOW As he took leave of my mother he looked at her in a strange way, mournfully and questioningly.\. END
BEGIN NOW and suddenly, with a rapid movement, drew out of his pocket the volume of The Worker's Leisure-Hour, and thrust it into my mother's hand. END
BEGIN NOW What's that? END
BEGIN NOW she inquired. END
BEGIN NOW Read\. END
BEGIN NOW here, he said hurriedly, where the corner's turned down, about death. END
BEGIN NOW It seems to me, it's terribly well said, but I can't make it out at all. END
BEGIN NOW Can't you explain it to me, my benefactress? END
BEGIN NOW I'll come back again and you explain it me. END
BEGIN NOW With these words Martin Petrovitch went away. END
BEGIN NOW He's in a bad way, he's in a bad way, observed my mother, directly he had disappeared through the doorway, and she set to work upon the Leisure-Hour. END
BEGIN NOW On the page turned down by Harlov were the following words: Death is a grand and solemn work of nature. END
BEGIN NOW It is nothing else than that the spirit, inasmuch as it is lighter, finer, and infinitely more penetrating than those elements under whose sway it has been subject, nay, even than the force of electricity itself, so is chemically purified and striveth upward till what time it attaineth an equally spiritual abiding-place for itself\. END
BEGIN NOW and so on. END
BEGIN NOW My mother read this passage through twice, and exclaiming, Pooh! END
BEGIN NOW she flung the book away. END
BEGIN NOW Three days later, she received the news that her sister's husband was dead, and set off to her sister's country-seat, taking me with her. END
BEGIN NOW My mother proposed to spend a month with her, but she stayed on till late in the autumn, and it was only at the end of September that we returned to our own estate. END
BEGIN NOW THE first news with which my valet, Prokofy, greeted me (he regarded himself as the seignorial huntsman) was that there was an immense number of wild snipe on the wing, and that in the birch-copse near Eskovo (Harlov's property), especially, they were simply swarming. END
BEGIN NOW I had three hours before me till dinner-time. END
BEGIN NOW I promptly seized my gun and my game-bag, and with Prokofy and a setter-dog, hastened to the Eskovo copse. END
BEGIN NOW We certainly did find a great many wild snipe there, and, firing about thirty charges, killed five. END
BEGIN NOW As I hurried homewards with my booty, I saw a peasant ploughing near the road-side. END
BEGIN NOW His horse had stopped, and with tearful and angry abuse he was mercilessly tugging with the cord reins at the animal's head, which was bent on one side. END
BEGIN NOW I looked attentively at the luckless beast, whose ribs were all but through its skin, and, bathed in sweat, heaved up and down with convulsive, irregular movements like a blacksmith's bellows. END
BEGIN NOW I recognised it at once as the decrepit old mare, with the scar on her shoulder, who had served Martin Petrovitch so many years. END
BEGIN NOW Is Mr. Harlov living? END
BEGIN NOW I asked Prokofy. END
BEGIN NOW The chase had so completely absorbed us, that up to that instant we had not talked of anything. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, he's alive. END
BEGIN NOW Why? END
BEGIN NOW But that's his mare, isn't it? END
BEGIN NOW Do you mean to say he's sold her? END
BEGIN NOW His mare it is, to be sure; but as to selling, he never sold her. END
BEGIN NOW But they took her away from him, and handed her over to that peasant. END
BEGIN NOW How, took it? END
BEGIN NOW And he consented? END
BEGIN NOW They never asked his consent. END
BEGIN NOW Things have changed here in your absence, Prokofy observed, with a faint smile in response to my look of amazement; worse luck! END
BEGIN NOW My goodness, yes! END
BEGIN NOW Now Sletkin's master, and orders every one about. END
BEGIN NOW But Martin Petrovitch? END
BEGIN NOW Why, Martin Petrovitch has become the very last person here, you may say. END
BEGIN NOW He's on bread and water,&mdash;what more can one say? END
BEGIN NOW They've crushed him altogether. END
BEGIN NOW Mark my words; they'll drive him out of the house. END
BEGIN NOW The idea that it was possible to drive such a giant had never entered my head. END
BEGIN NOW And what does Zhitkov say to it? END
BEGIN NOW I asked at last. END
BEGIN NOW I suppose he's married to the second daughter? END
BEGIN NOW Married? END
BEGIN NOW repeated Prokofy, and this time he grinned all over his face. END
BEGIN NOW They won't let him into the house. END
BEGIN NOW 'We don't want you,' they say; 'get along home with you.' END
BEGIN NOW It's as I said; Sletkin directs every one. END
BEGIN NOW But what does the young lady say? END
BEGIN NOW Evlampia Martinovna? END
BEGIN NOW Ah, master, I could tell you\. END
BEGIN NOW but you're young&mdash;one must think of that. END
BEGIN NOW Things are going on here that are\. END
BEGIN NOW oh!\. END
BEGIN NOW oh!\. END
BEGIN NOW oh! END
BEGIN NOW Hey! END
BEGIN NOW why Dianka's setting, I do believe! END
BEGIN NOW My dog actually had stopped short, before a thick oak bush which bordered a narrow ravine by the roadside. END
BEGIN NOW Prokofy and I ran up to the dog; a snipe flew up out of the bush, we both fired at it and missed; the snipe settled in another place; we followed it. END
BEGIN NOW The soup was already on the table when I got back. END
BEGIN NOW My mother scolded me. END
BEGIN NOW What's the meaning of it? END
BEGIN NOW she said with displeasure; the very first day, and you keep us waiting for dinner. END
BEGIN NOW I brought her the wild snipe I had killed; she did not even look at them. END
BEGIN NOW There were also in the room Souvenir, Kvitsinsky, and Zhitkov. END
BEGIN NOW The retired major was huddled in a corner, for all the world like a schoolboy in disgrace. END
BEGIN NOW His face wore an expression of mingled confusion and annoyance; his eyes were red\. END
BEGIN NOW One might positively have imagined he had recently been in tears. END
BEGIN NOW My mother remained in an ill humour. END
BEGIN NOW I was at no great pains to surmise that my late arrival did not count for much in it. END
BEGIN NOW During dinner-time she hardly talked at all. END
BEGIN NOW The major turned beseeching glances upon her from time to time, but ate a good dinner nevertheless. END
BEGIN NOW Souvenir was all of a shake. END
BEGIN NOW Kvitsinsky preserved his habitual self-confidence of demeanour. END
BEGIN NOW Vikenty Osipitch, my mother addressed him, I beg you to send a carriage to-morrow for Martin Petrovitch, since it has come to my knowledge that he has none of his own. END
BEGIN NOW And bid them tell him to come without fail, that I desire to see him. END
BEGIN NOW Kvitsinsky was about to make some rejoinder, but he restrained himself. END
BEGIN NOW And let Sletkin know, continued my mother, that I command him to present himself before me\. END
BEGIN NOW Do you hear? END
BEGIN NOW I com\. END
BEGIN NOW mand! END
BEGIN NOW Yes, just so\. END
BEGIN NOW that scoundrel ought&mdash;- Zhitkov was beginning in a subdued voice; but my mother gave him such a contemptuous look, that he promptly turned away and was silent. END
BEGIN NOW Do you hear? END
BEGIN NOW I command! END
BEGIN NOW repeated my mother. END
BEGIN NOW Certainly, madam, Kvitsinsky replied submissively but with dignity. END
BEGIN NOW Martin Petrovitch won't come! END
BEGIN NOW Souvenir whispered to me, as he came out of the dining-room with me after dinner. END
BEGIN NOW You should just see what's happened to him! END
BEGIN NOW It's past comprehension! END
BEGIN NOW It's come to this, that whatever they say to him, he doesn't understand a word! END
BEGIN NOW Yes! END
BEGIN NOW They've got the snake under the pitchfork! END
BEGIN NOW And Souvenir went off into his revolting laugh. END
BEGIN NOW SOUVENIR'S prediction turned out correct. END
BEGIN NOW Martin Petrovitch would not come to my mother. END
BEGIN NOW She was not at all pleased with this, and despatched a letter to him. END
BEGIN NOW He sent her a square bit of paper, on which the following words were written in big letters: Indeed I can't. END
BEGIN NOW I should die of shame. END
BEGIN NOW Let me go to my ruin. END
BEGIN NOW Thanks. END
BEGIN NOW Don't torture me&mdash;Martin Harlov. END
BEGIN NOW Sletkin did come, but not on the day on which my mother had commanded his attendance, but twenty-four hours later. END
BEGIN NOW My mother gave orders that he should be shown into her boudoir.\. END
BEGIN NOW God knows what their interview was about, but it did not last long; a quarter of an hour, not more. END
BEGIN NOW Sletkin came out of my mother's room, crimson all over, and with such a viciously spiteful and insolent expression of face, that, meeting him in the drawing-room I was simply petrified, while Souvenir, who was hanging about there, stopped short in the middle of a snigger. END
BEGIN NOW My mother came out of her boudoir, also very red in the face, and announced, in the hearing of all, that Mr. Sletkin was never, upon any pretext, to be admitted to her presence again, and that if Martin Petrovitch's daughters were to make bold&mdash;they've impudence enough, said she&mdash;to present themselves, they, too, were to be refused admittance. END
BEGIN NOW At dinner-time she suddenly exclaimed, The vile little Jew! END
BEGIN NOW I picked him out of the gutter, I made him a career, he owes everything, everything to me,&mdash;and he dares to tell me I've no business to meddle in their affairs! END
BEGIN NOW that Martin Petrovitch is full of whims and fancies, and it's impossible to humour him! END
BEGIN NOW Humour him, indeed! END
BEGIN NOW What a thing to say! END
BEGIN NOW Ah, he's an ungrateful wretch! END
BEGIN NOW An insolent little Jew! END
BEGIN NOW Major Zhitkov, who happened to be one of the company at dinner, imagined that now it was no less than the will of the Almighty for him to seize the opportunity and put in his word\. END
BEGIN NOW but my mother promptly settled him. END
BEGIN NOW Well, and you're a fine one, too, my man! END
BEGIN NOW she commented. END
BEGIN NOW Couldn't get the upper hand of a girl, and he an officer! END
BEGIN NOW In command of a squadron! END
BEGIN NOW I can fancy how it obeyed you! END
BEGIN NOW He take a steward's place indeed! END
BEGIN NOW a fine steward he'd make! END
BEGIN NOW Kvitsinsky, who was sitting at the end of the table, smiled to himself a little malignantly, while poor Zhitkov could do nothing but twitch his moustaches, lift his eyebrows, and bury the whole of his hirsute countenance in his napkin. END
BEGIN NOW After dinner, he went out on to the steps to smoke his pipe as usual, and he struck me as so miserable and forlorn, that, although I had never liked him, I joined myself on to him at once. END
BEGIN NOW How was it, Gavrila Fedulitch, I began without further beating about the bush, that your affair with Evlampia Martinovna was broken off? END
BEGIN NOW I'd expected you to be married long ago. END
BEGIN NOW The retired major looked at me dejectedly. END
BEGIN NOW A snake in the grass, he began, uttering each letter of each syllable with bitter distinctness, has poisoned me with his fang, and turned all my hopes in life to ashes. END
BEGIN NOW And I could tell you, Dmitri Semyonovitch, all his hellish wiles, but I'm afraid of angering your mamma. END
BEGIN NOW ('You're young yet'&mdash;Prokofy's expression flashed across my mind.) END
BEGIN NOW Even as it is &mdash;Zhitkov groaned. END
BEGIN NOW Patience\. END
BEGIN NOW patience\. END
BEGIN NOW nothing else is left me. END
BEGIN NOW (He struck his fist upon his chest.) END
BEGIN NOW Patience, old soldier, patience. END
BEGIN NOW I served the Tsar faithfully\. END
BEGIN NOW honourably\. END
BEGIN NOW yes. END
BEGIN NOW I spared neither blood nor sweat, and now see what I am brought to. END
BEGIN NOW Had it been in the regiment&mdash;and the matter depending upon me, he continued after a short silence, spent in convulsively sucking at his cherrywood pipe, & # ;I'd have\. END
BEGIN NOW I'd have given it him with the flat side of my sword\. END
BEGIN NOW three times over till he'd had enough\. END
BEGIN NOW Zhitkov took the pipe out of his mouth, and fixed his eyes on vacancy, as though admiring the picture he had conjured up. END
BEGIN NOW Souvenir ran up, and began quizzing the major. END
BEGIN NOW I turned away from them, and determined, come what may, I would see Martin Petrovitch with my own eyes.\. END
BEGIN NOW My boyish curiosity was greatly stirred. END
BEGIN NOW NEXT day I set out with my gun and dog, but without Prokofy, to the Eskovo copse. END
BEGIN NOW It was an exquisite day; I fancy there are no days like that in September anywhere but in Russia. END
BEGIN NOW The stillness was such that one could hear, a hundred paces off, the squirrel hopping over the dry leaves, and the broken twig just feebly catching at the other branches, and falling, at last, on the soft grass&mdash;to lie there for ever, not to stir again till it rotted away. END
BEGIN NOW The air, neither warm nor chill, but only fragrant, and as it were keen, was faintly, deliciously stinging in my eyes and on my cheeks. END
BEGIN NOW A long spider-web, delicate as a silken thread, with a white ball in the middle, floated smoothly in the air, and sticking to the butt-end of my gun, stretched straight out in the air&mdash;a sign of settled and warm weather. END
BEGIN NOW The sun shone with a brightness as soft as moonlight. END
BEGIN NOW Wild snipe were to be met with pretty often; but I did not pay special attention to them. END
BEGIN NOW I knew that the copse went on almost to Harlov's homestead, right up to the hedge of his garden, and I turned my steps in that direction, though I could not even imagine how I should get into the place itself, and was even doubtful whether I ought to try to do so, as my mother was so angry with its new owners. END
BEGIN NOW Sounds of life and humanity reached me from no great distance. END
BEGIN NOW I listened.\. END
BEGIN NOW Some one was coming through the copse\. END
BEGIN NOW straight towards me. END
BEGIN NOW You should have said so straight out, dear, I heard a woman's voice. END
BEGIN NOW Be reasonable, another voice broke in, the voice of a man. END
BEGIN NOW Can one do it all at once? END
BEGIN NOW I knew the voices. END
BEGIN NOW There was the gleam of a woman's blue gown through the reddening nut bushes. END
BEGIN NOW Beside it stood a dark full coat. END
BEGIN NOW Another instant&mdash;and there stepped out into the glade, five paces from me, Sletkin and Evlampia. END
BEGIN NOW They were disconcerted at once. END
BEGIN NOW Evlampia promptly stepped back, away into the bushes. END
BEGIN NOW Sletkin thought a little, and came up to me. END
BEGIN NOW There was not a trace to be seen in his face of the obsequious meekness, with which he had paced up and down Harlov's courtyard, four months before, rubbing up my horse's snaffle. END
BEGIN NOW But neither could I perceive in it the insolent defiance, which had so struck me on the previous day, on the threshold of my mother's boudoir. END
BEGIN NOW It was still as white and pretty as ever, but seemed broader and more solid. END
BEGIN NOW Well, have you shot many snipe? END
BEGIN NOW he asked me, raising his cap, smiling, and passing his hand over his black curls; you are shooting in our copse.\. END
BEGIN NOW You are very welcome. END
BEGIN NOW We would not hinder you.\. END
BEGIN NOW Quite the contrary. END
BEGIN NOW I have killed nothing to-day, I rejoined, answering his first question; and I will go out of your copse this instant. END
BEGIN NOW Sletkin hurriedly put on his cap. END
BEGIN NOW Indeed, why so? END
BEGIN NOW We would not drive you out&mdash;indeed, we're delighted.\. END
BEGIN NOW Here's Evlampia Martinovna will say the same. END
BEGIN NOW Evlampia Martinovna, come here. END
BEGIN NOW Where have you hidden yourself? END
BEGIN NOW Evlampia's head appeared behind the bushes. END
BEGIN NOW But she did not come up to us. END
BEGIN NOW She had grown prettier, and seemed taller and bigger than ever. END
BEGIN NOW I'm very glad, to tell the truth, Sletkin went on, that I have met you. END
BEGIN NOW Though you are still young in years, you have plenty of good sense already. END
BEGIN NOW Your mother was pleased to be very angry with me yesterday&mdash;she would not listen to reason of any sort from me, but I declare, as before God, so before you now, I am not to blame in any way. END
BEGIN NOW We can't treat Martin Petrovitch otherwise than we do; he's fallen into complete dotage. END
BEGIN NOW One can't humour all his whims, really. END
BEGIN NOW But we show him all due respect. END
BEGIN NOW Only ask Evlampia Martinovna. END
BEGIN NOW Evlampia did not stir; her habitual scornful smile flickered about her lips, and her large eyes watched us with no friendly expression. END
BEGIN NOW But why, Vladimir Vassilievitch, have you sold Martin Petrovitch's mare? END
BEGIN NOW (I was particularly impressed by that mare being in the possession of a peasant.) END
BEGIN NOW His mare, why did we sell it? END
BEGIN NOW Why, Lord have mercy on us&mdash;what use was she? END
BEGIN NOW She was simply eating her head off. END
BEGIN NOW But with the peasant she can work at the plough anyway. END
BEGIN NOW As for Martin Petrovitch, if he takes a fancy to drive out anywhere, he's only to ask us. END
BEGIN NOW We wouldn't refuse him a conveyance. END
BEGIN NOW On a holiday, we should be pleased. END
BEGIN NOW Vladimir Vassilievitch, said Evlampia huskily, as though calling him away, and she still did not stir from her place. END
BEGIN NOW She was twisting some stalks of ripple grass round her fingers and snapping off their heads, slapping them against each other. END
BEGIN NOW About the page Maximka again, Sletkin went on, Martin Petrovitch complains because we've taken him away and apprenticed him. END
BEGIN NOW But kindly consider the matter for yourself. END
BEGIN NOW Why, what had he to do waiting on Martin Petrovitch? END
BEGIN NOW Kick up his heels; nothing more. END
BEGIN NOW And he couldn't even wait on him properly; on account of his stupidity and his youth. END
BEGIN NOW Now we have sent him away to a harness-maker's. END
BEGIN NOW He'll be turned into a first-rate handicraftsman&mdash;and make a good thing of it for himself&mdash;and pay us ransom-money too. END
BEGIN NOW And, living in a small way as we do, that's a matter of importance. END
BEGIN NOW On a little farm like ours, one can't afford to let anything slip. END
BEGIN NOW And this is the man Martin Petrovitch called a 'poor stick,' I thought. END
BEGIN NOW But who reads to Martin Petrovitch now? END
BEGIN NOW I asked. END
BEGIN NOW Why, what is there to read? END
BEGIN NOW He had one book&mdash;but, luckily, that's been mislaid somewhere.\. END
BEGIN NOW And what use is reading at his age. END
BEGIN NOW And who shaves him? END
BEGIN NOW I asked again. END
BEGIN NOW Sletkin gave an approving laugh, as though in response to an amusing joke. END
BEGIN NOW Why, nobody. END
BEGIN NOW At first he used to singe his beard in the candle&mdash;but now he lets it be altogether. END
BEGIN NOW And it's lovely! END
BEGIN NOW Vladimir Vassilievitch! END
BEGIN NOW Evlampia repeated insistently: Vladimir Vassilievitch! END
BEGIN NOW Sletkin made her a sign with his hand. END
BEGIN NOW Martin Petrovitch is clothed and cared for, and eats what we do. END
BEGIN NOW What more does he want? END
BEGIN NOW He declared himself that he wanted nothing more in this world but to think of his soul. END
BEGIN NOW If only he would realise that everything now, however you look at it, is ours. END
BEGIN NOW He says too that we don't pay him his allowance. END
BEGIN NOW But we've not always got money ourselves; and what does he want with it, when he has everything provided him? END
BEGIN NOW And we treat him as one of the family too. END
BEGIN NOW I'm telling you the truth. END
BEGIN NOW The rooms, for instance, which he occupies&mdash;how we need them! END
BEGIN NOW there's simply not room to turn round without them; but we don't say a word&mdash;we put up with it. END
BEGIN NOW We even think how to provide amusement for him. END
BEGIN NOW There, on St. Peter's Day, I bought him some excellent hooks in the town&mdash;real English ones, expensive hooks, to catch fish. END
BEGIN NOW There are lots of carp in our pond. END
BEGIN NOW Let him sit and fish; in an hour or two, there'd be a nice little fish soup provided. END
BEGIN NOW The most suitable occupation for old men. END
BEGIN NOW Vladimir Vassilitch! END
BEGIN NOW Evlampia called for the third time in an incisive tone, and she flung far away from her the grass she had been twisting in her fingers, I am going! END
BEGIN NOW Her eyes met mine. END
BEGIN NOW I am going, Vladimir Vassilievitch! END
BEGIN NOW she repeated, and vanished behind a bush. END
BEGIN NOW I'm coming, Evlampia Martinovna, directly! END
BEGIN NOW shouted Sletkin. END
BEGIN NOW Martin Petrovitch himself agrees with us now, he went on, turning again to me. END
BEGIN NOW At first he was offended, certainly, and even grumbled, until, you know, he realised; he was, you remember, a hot-tempered violent man&mdash;more s the pity! END
BEGIN NOW but there, he's grown quite meek now. END
BEGIN NOW Because he sees his own interest. END
BEGIN NOW Your mamma&mdash;mercy on us! END
BEGIN NOW how she pitched into me!\. END
BEGIN NOW To be sure: she's a lady that sets as much store by her own authority as Martin Petrovitch used to do. END
BEGIN NOW But you come in and see for yourself. END
BEGIN NOW And you might put in a word when there's an opportunity. END
BEGIN NOW I feel Natalia Nikolaevna's bounty to me deeply. END
BEGIN NOW But we've got to live too. END
BEGIN NOW And how was it Zhitkov was refused? END
BEGIN NOW I asked. END
BEGIN NOW Fedulitch? END
BEGIN NOW That dolt? END
BEGIN NOW Sletkin shrugged his shoulders. END
BEGIN NOW Why, upon my word, what use could he have been? END
BEGIN NOW His whole life spent among soldiers&mdash;and now he has a fancy to take up farming. END
BEGIN NOW He can keep the peasants up to the mark, says he, because he's been used to knocking men about. END
BEGIN NOW He can do nothing; even knocking men about wants some sense. END
BEGIN NOW Evlampia Martinovna refused him herself. END
BEGIN NOW He was a quite unsuitable person. END
BEGIN NOW All our farming would have gone to ruin with him! END
BEGIN NOW Coo&mdash;y! END
BEGIN NOW sounded Evlampia's musical voice. END
BEGIN NOW Coming! END
BEGIN NOW coming! END
BEGIN NOW Sletkin called back. END
BEGIN NOW He held out his hand to me. END
BEGIN NOW Though unwillingly, I took it. END
BEGIN NOW I beg to take leave, Dmitri Semyonovitch, said Sletkin, showing all his white teeth, Shoot wild snipe as much as you like. END
BEGIN NOW It's wild game, belonging to no one. END
BEGIN NOW But if you come across a hare&mdash;you spare it; that game is ours. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, and something else! END
BEGIN NOW won't you be having pups from your bitch? END
BEGIN NOW I should be obliged for one! END
BEGIN NOW Coo&mdash;y! END
BEGIN NOW Evlampia's voice rang out again. END
BEGIN NOW Coo&mdash;y! END
BEGIN NOW Sletkin responded, and rushed into the bushes. END
BEGIN NOW I REMEMBER, when I was left alone, I was absorbed in wondering how it was Harlov had not pounded Sletkin into a jelly, as he said, and how it was Sletkin had not been afraid of such a fate. END
BEGIN NOW It was clear Martin Petrovitch really had grown meek, I thought, and I had a still stronger desire to make my way into Eskovo, and get at least a glance at that colossus, whom I could never picture to myself subdued and tractable. END
BEGIN NOW I had reached the edge of the copse, when suddenly a big snipe, with a great rush of wings, darted up at my very feet, and flew off into the depths of the wood. END
BEGIN NOW I took aim; my gun missed fire. END
BEGIN NOW I was greatly annoyed; it had been such a fine bird, and I made up my mind to try if I couldn't make it rise a second time. END
BEGIN NOW I set off in the direction of its flight, and going some two hundred paces off into the wood I caught sight&mdash;in a little glade, under an overhanging birch-tree&mdash;not of the snipe, but of the same Sletkin once more. END
BEGIN NOW He was lying on his back, with both hands under his head, and with a smile of contentment gazing upwards at the sky, swinging his left leg, which was crossed over his right knee. END
BEGIN NOW He did not notice my approach. END
BEGIN NOW A few paces from him, Evlampia was walking slowly up and down the little glade, with downcast eyes. END
BEGIN NOW It seemed as though she were looking for something in the grass&mdash;mushrooms or something; now and then, she stooped and stretched out her hand. END
BEGIN NOW She was singing in a low voice. END
BEGIN NOW I stopped at once, and fell to listening. END
BEGIN NOW At first I could not make out what it was she was singing, but afterwards I recognised clearly the following well-known lines of the old ballad: Hither, hither, threatening storm-cloud, Slay for me the father-in-law, Strike for me the mother-in-law, The young wife I will kill myself! END
BEGIN NOW Evlampia sang louder and louder; the last words she delivered with peculiar energy. END
BEGIN NOW Sletkin still lay on his back and laughed to himself, while she seemed all the time to be moving round and round him. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, indeed! END
BEGIN NOW he commented at last. END
BEGIN NOW The things that come into some people's heads! END
BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW queried Evlampia. END
BEGIN NOW Sletkin raised his head a little. END
BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW Why, what words were those you were uttering? END
BEGIN NOW Why, you know, Volodya, one can't leave the words out of a song, answered Evlampia, and she turned and saw me. END
BEGIN NOW We both cried out aloud at once, and both rushed away in opposite directions. END
BEGIN NOW I made my way hurriedly out of the copse, and crossing a narrow clearing, found myself facing Harlov's garden. END
BEGIN NOW I HAD no time, nor would it have been of any use, to deliberate over what I had seen. END
BEGIN NOW Only an expression kept recurring to my mind, love spell, which I had lately heard, and over the signification of which I had pondered a good deal. END
BEGIN NOW I walked alongside the garden fence, and in a few moments, behind the silver poplars (they had not yet lost a single leaf, and the foliage was luxuriantly thick and brilliantly glistening), I saw the yard and two little lodges of Martin Petrovitch's homestead. END
BEGIN NOW The whole place struck me as having been tidied up and pulled into shape. END
BEGIN NOW On every side one could perceive traces of unflagging and severe supervision. END
BEGIN NOW Anna Martinovna came out on to the steps, and screwing up her blue-grey eyes, gazed for a long while in the direction of the copse. END
BEGIN NOW Have you seen the master? END
BEGIN NOW she asked a peasant, who was walking across the yard. END
BEGIN NOW Vladimir Vassilitch? END
BEGIN NOW responded the latter, taking his cap off. END
BEGIN NOW He went into the copse, surely. END
BEGIN NOW I know, he went to the copse. END
BEGIN NOW Hasn't he come back? END
BEGIN NOW Haven't you seen him? END
BEGIN NOW I've not seen him\. END
BEGIN NOW nay. END
BEGIN NOW The peasant continued standing bareheaded before Anna Martinovna. END
BEGIN NOW Well, you can go, she said. END
BEGIN NOW Or no&mdash;-wait a bit&mdash;-where's Martin Petrovitch? END
BEGIN NOW Do you know? END
BEGIN NOW Oh, Martin Petrovitch, answered the peasant, in a sing-song voice, alternately lifting his right and then his left hand, as though pointing away somewhere, is sitting yonder, at the pond, with a fishing-rod. END
BEGIN NOW He's sitting in the reeds, with a rod. END
BEGIN NOW Catching fish, maybe, God knows. END
BEGIN NOW Very well\. END
BEGIN NOW you can go, repeated Anna Martinovna; and put away that wheel, it's lying about. END
BEGIN NOW The peasant ran to carry out her command, while she remained standing a few minutes longer on the steps, still gazing in the direction of the copse. END
BEGIN NOW Then she clenched one fist menacingly, and went slowly back into the house. END
BEGIN NOW Axiutka! END
BEGIN NOW I heard her imperious voice calling within. END
BEGIN NOW Anna Martinovna looked angry, and tightened her lips, thin enough at all times, with a sort of special energy. END
BEGIN NOW She was carelessly dressed, and a coil of loose hair had fallen down on to her shoulder. END
BEGIN NOW But in spite of the negligence of her attire, and her irritable humour, she struck me, just as before, as attractive, and I should have been delighted to kiss the narrow hand which looked malignant too, as she twice irritably pushed back the loose tress. END
BEGIN NOW CAN Martin Petrovitch have really taken to fishing? END
BEGIN NOW I asked myself, as I turned towards the pond, which was on one side of the garden. END
BEGIN NOW I got on to the dam, looked in all directions.\. END
BEGIN NOW Martin Petrovitch was nowhere to be seen. END
BEGIN NOW I bent my steps along one of the banks of the pond, and at last, at the very top of it, in a little creek, in the midst of flat broken-down stalks of reddish reed, I caught sight of a huge greyish mass.\. END
BEGIN NOW I looked intently: it was Harlov. END
BEGIN NOW Bareheaded, unkempt, in a cotton smock torn at the seams, with his legs crossed under him, he was sitting motionless on the bare earth. END
BEGIN NOW So motionless was he that a sandpiper, at my approach, darted up from the dry mud a couple of paces from him, and flew with a flash of its little wings and a whistle over the surface of the water, showing that no one had moved to frighten him for a long while. END
BEGIN NOW Harlov's whole appearance was so extraordinary that my dog stopped short directly it saw him, lifted its tail, and growled. END
BEGIN NOW He turned his head a very little, and fixed his wild-looking eyes on me and my dog. END
BEGIN NOW He was greatly changed by his beard, though it was short, but thick and curly, in white tufts, like Astrachan fur. END
BEGIN NOW In his right hand lay the end of a rod, while the other end hovered feebly over the water. END
BEGIN NOW I felt an involuntary pang at my heart. END
BEGIN NOW I plucked up my spirits, however, went up to him, and wished him good morning. END
BEGIN NOW He slowly blinked as though just awake. END
BEGIN NOW What are you doing, Martin Petrovitch, I began, catching fish here? END
BEGIN NOW Yes\. END
BEGIN NOW fish, he answered huskily, and pulled up the rod, on which there fluttered a piece of line, a fathom length, with no hook on it. END
BEGIN NOW Your tackle is broken off, I observed, and noticed the same moment that there was no sign of bait-tin nor worms near Martin Petrovitch.\. END
BEGIN NOW And what sort of fishing could there be in September? END
BEGIN NOW Broken off? END
BEGIN NOW he said, and he passed his hand over his face. END
BEGIN NOW But it's all the same! END
BEGIN NOW He dropped the rod in again. END
BEGIN NOW Natalia Nikolaevna's son? END
BEGIN NOW he asked me, after the lapse of two minutes, during which I had been gazing at him with secret bewilderment. END
BEGIN NOW Though he had grown terribly thinner, still he seemed a giant. END
BEGIN NOW But what rags he was dressed in, and how utterly he had gone to pieces altogether! END
BEGIN NOW Yes, I answered, I'm the son of Natalia Nikolaevna B. END
BEGIN NOW Is she well? END
BEGIN NOW My mother is quite well. END
BEGIN NOW She was very much hurt at your refusal, I added; she did not at all expect you would not wish to come and see her. END
BEGIN NOW Martin Petrovitch's head sank on his breast. END
BEGIN NOW Have you been there? END
BEGIN NOW he asked, with a motion of his head. END
BEGIN NOW Where? END
BEGIN NOW There, at the house. END
BEGIN NOW Haven't you? END
BEGIN NOW Go! END
BEGIN NOW What is there for you to do here? END
BEGIN NOW Go! END
BEGIN NOW It's useless talking to me. END
BEGIN NOW I don't like it. END
BEGIN NOW He was silent for a while. END
BEGIN NOW You'd like to be always idling about with a gun! END
BEGIN NOW In my young days I used to be inclined the same way too. END
BEGIN NOW Only my father was strict and made me respect him too. END
BEGIN NOW Mind you, very different from fathers now-a-days. END
BEGIN NOW My father flogged me with a horsewhip, and that was the end of it! END
BEGIN NOW I'd to give up idling about! END
BEGIN NOW And so I respected him.\. END
BEGIN NOW Oo!\. END
BEGIN NOW Yes!\. END
BEGIN NOW Harlov paused again. END
BEGIN NOW Don't you stop here, he began again. END
BEGIN NOW You go along to the house. END
BEGIN NOW Things are managed there now&mdash;it's first-rate. END
BEGIN NOW Volodka\. END
BEGIN NOW Here he faltered for a second. END
BEGIN NOW Our Volodka's a good hand at everything. END
BEGIN NOW He's a fine fellow! END
BEGIN NOW yes, indeed, and a fine scoundrel too! END
BEGIN NOW I did not know what to say; Martin Petrovitch spoke very tranquilly. END
BEGIN NOW And you go and see my daughters. END
BEGIN NOW You remember, I daresay, I had daughters. END
BEGIN NOW They're managers too\. END
BEGIN NOW clever ones. END
BEGIN NOW But I'm growing old, my lad; I'm on the shelf. END
BEGIN NOW Time to repose, you know.\. END
BEGIN NOW Nice sort of repose! END
BEGIN NOW I thought, glancing round. END
BEGIN NOW Martin Petrovitch! END
BEGIN NOW I uttered aloud, you really must come and see us. END
BEGIN NOW Harlov looked at me. END
BEGIN NOW Go along, my lad, I tell you. END
BEGIN NOW Don't hurt mamma's feelings; come and see us. END
BEGIN NOW Go away, my lad, go away, persisted Harlov. END
BEGIN NOW What do you want to talk to me for? END
BEGIN NOW If you have no carriage, mamma will send you hers. END
BEGIN NOW Go along! END
BEGIN NOW But, really and truly, Martin Petrovitch! END
BEGIN NOW Harlov looked down again, and I fancied that his cheeks, dingy as though covered with earth, faintly flushed. END
BEGIN NOW Really, do come, I went on. END
BEGIN NOW What's the use of your sitting here? END
BEGIN NOW of your making yourself miserable? END
BEGIN NOW Making myself miserable? END
BEGIN NOW he commented hesitatingly. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, to be sure&mdash;making yourself miserable! END
BEGIN NOW I repeated. END
BEGIN NOW Harlov said nothing, and seemed lost in musing. END
BEGIN NOW Emboldened by his silence, I determined to be open, to act straightforwardly, bluntly. END
BEGIN NOW (Do not forget, I was only fifteen then.) END
BEGIN NOW Martin Petrovitch! END
BEGIN NOW I began, seating myself beside him. END
BEGIN NOW I know everything, you see, positively everything. END
BEGIN NOW I know how your son-in-law is treating you&mdash;doubtless with the consent of your daughters. END
BEGIN NOW And now you are in such a position\. END
BEGIN NOW But why lose heart? END
BEGIN NOW Harlov still remained silent, and simply dropped in his line; while I&mdash;what a sensible fellow, what a sage I felt! END
BEGIN NOW Doubtless, I began again, you acted imprudently in giving up everything to your daughters. END
BEGIN NOW It was most generous on your part, and I am not going to blame you. END
BEGIN NOW In our days it is a quality only too rare! END
BEGIN NOW But since your daughters are so ungrateful, you ought to show a contempt&mdash;yes, a contempt&mdash;for them\. END
BEGIN NOW and not fret&mdash;- Stop! END
BEGIN NOW muttered Harlov suddenly, gnashing his teeth, and his eyes, staring at the pond, glittered wrathfully\. END
BEGIN NOW Go away! END
BEGIN NOW But, Martin Petrovitch&mdash;- Go away, I tell you,\. END
BEGIN NOW or I'll kill you! END
BEGIN NOW I had come quite close to him; but at the last words I instinctively jumped up. END
BEGIN NOW What did you say, Martin Petrovitch? END
BEGIN NOW I'll kill you, I tell you; go away! END
BEGIN NOW With a wild moan, a roar, the words broke from Harlov's breast, but he did not turn his head, and still stared wrathfully straight in front of him. END
BEGIN NOW I'll take you and fling you and your fool's counsel into the water. END
BEGIN NOW You shall learn to pester the old, little milksop! END
BEGIN NOW He's gone mad! END
BEGIN NOW flashed through my mind. END
BEGIN NOW I looked at him more attentively, and was completely petrified; Martin Petrovitch was weeping!! END
BEGIN NOW Tear after tear rolled from his eyelashes down his cheeks\. END
BEGIN NOW while his face had assumed an expression utterly savage.\. END
BEGIN NOW Go away! END
BEGIN NOW he roared once more, or I'll kill you, by God! END
BEGIN NOW for an example to others! END
BEGIN NOW He was shaking all over from side to side, and showing his teeth like a wild boar. END
BEGIN NOW I snatched up my gun and took to my heels. END
BEGIN NOW My dog flew after me, barking. END
BEGIN NOW He, too, was frightened. END
BEGIN NOW When I got home, I naturally did not, by so much as a word, to my mother, hint at what I had seen; but coming across Souvenir, I told him&mdash;the devil knows why&mdash;all about it. END
BEGIN NOW That loathsome person was so delighted at my story, shrieking with laughter, and even dancing with pleasure, that I could hardly forbear striking him. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW I should like, he kept repeating breathless with laughter, to see that fiend, the Swede, Harlov, crawling into the mud and sitting in it.\. END
BEGIN NOW Go over to the pond if you're so curious. END
BEGIN NOW Yes; but how if he kills me? END
BEGIN NOW I felt horribly sick at Souvenir, and regretted my ill-timed confidence.\. END
BEGIN NOW Zhitkov, to whom he repeated my tale, looked at the matter somewhat differently. END
BEGIN NOW We shall have to call in the police, he concluded, or, may be, we may have to send for a battalion of military. END
BEGIN NOW His forebodings with regard to the military battalion did not come true; but something extraordinary really did happen. END
BEGIN NOW IN the middle of October, three weeks after my interview with Martin Petrovitch, I was standing at the window of my own room in the second storey of our house, and thinking of nothing at all, I looked disconsolately into the yard and the road that lay beyond it. END
BEGIN NOW The weather had been disgusting for the last five days. END
BEGIN NOW Shooting was not even to be thought of. END
BEGIN NOW All things living had hidden themselves; even the sparrows made no sound, and the rooks had long ago disappeared from sight. END
BEGIN NOW The wind howled drearily, then whistled spasmodically. END
BEGIN NOW The low-hanging sky, unbroken by one streak of light, had changed from an unpleasant whitish to a leaden and still more sinister hue; and the rain, which had been pouring and pouring, mercilessly and unceasingly, had suddenly become still more violent and more driving, and streamed with a rushing sound over the panes. END
BEGIN NOW The trees had been stripped utterly bare, and turned a sort of grey. END
BEGIN NOW It seemed they had nothing left to plunder; yet the wind would not be denied, but set to harassing them once more. END
BEGIN NOW Puddles, clogged with dead leaves, stood everywhere. END
BEGIN NOW Big bubbles, continually bursting and rising up again, leaped and glided over them. END
BEGIN NOW Along the roads, the mud lay thick and impassable. END
BEGIN NOW The cold pierced its way indoors through one's clothes to the very bones. END
BEGIN NOW An involuntary shiver passed over the body, and how sick one felt at heart! END
BEGIN NOW Sick, precisely, not sad. END
BEGIN NOW It seemed there would never again in the world be sunshine, nor brightness, nor colour, but this rain and mire and grey damp, and raw fog would last for ever, and for ever would the wind whine and moan! END
BEGIN NOW Well, I was standing moodily at my window, and I remember a sudden darkness came on&mdash;a bluish darkness&mdash;though the clock only pointed to twelve. END
BEGIN NOW Suddenly I fancied I saw a bear dash across our yard from the gates to the steps! END
BEGIN NOW Not on all-fours, certainly, but as he is depicted when he gets up on his hind-paws. END
BEGIN NOW I could not believe my eyes. END
BEGIN NOW If it were not a bear I had seen, it was, any way, something enormous, black, shaggy.\. END
BEGIN NOW I was still lost in wonder as to what it could be, when suddenly I heard below a furious knocking. END
BEGIN NOW It seemed something utterly unlooked for, something terrible was stumbling headlong into our house. END
BEGIN NOW Then began a commotion, a hurrying to and fro.\. END
BEGIN NOW I quickly went down the stairs, ran into the dining-room.\. END
BEGIN NOW At the drawing-room door facing me stood my mother, as though rooted to the spot. END
BEGIN NOW Behind her, peered several scared female faces. END
BEGIN NOW The butler, two footmen, and a page, with his mouth wide open with astonishment, were packed together in the doorway of the hall. END
BEGIN NOW In the middle of the dining-room, covered with mire, dishevelled, tattered, and soaking wet&mdash;so wet that steam rose all round and water was running in little streams over the floor&mdash;knelt, shaking ponderously, as it were, at the last gasp\. END
BEGIN NOW the very monster I had seen dashing across the yard! END
BEGIN NOW And who was this monster? END
BEGIN NOW Harlov! END
BEGIN NOW I came up on one side, and saw, not his face, but his head, which he was clutching, with both hands in the hair that blinded him with filth. END
BEGIN NOW He was breathing heavily, brokenly; some thing positively rattled in his throat&mdash;and in all the bespattered dark mass, the only thing that could be clearly distinguished was the tiny whites of the eyes, straying wildly about. END
BEGIN NOW He was awful! END
BEGIN NOW The dignitary came into my mind whom he had once crushed for comparing him to a mastodon. END
BEGIN NOW Truly, so might have looked some antediluvian creature that had just escaped another more powerful monster, attacking it in the eternal slime of the primeval swamps. END
BEGIN NOW Martin Petrovitch! END
BEGIN NOW my mother cried at last, and she clasped her hands. END
BEGIN NOW Is that you? END
BEGIN NOW Good God! END
BEGIN NOW Merciful heavens! END
BEGIN NOW I\. END
BEGIN NOW I\. END
BEGIN NOW we heard a broken voice, which seemed with effort and painfully to dwell on each sound. END
BEGIN NOW Alas! END
BEGIN NOW It is I! END
BEGIN NOW But what has happened to you? END
BEGIN NOW Mercy upon us! END
BEGIN NOW Natalia Nikolaev\. END
BEGIN NOW na\. END
BEGIN NOW I have\. END
BEGIN NOW run straight\. END
BEGIN NOW to you\. END
BEGIN NOW from home\. END
BEGIN NOW on foot.\. END
BEGIN NOW Through such mud! END
BEGIN NOW But you don't look like a man. END
BEGIN NOW Get up; sit down, anyway.\. END
BEGIN NOW And you, she turned to the maid-servants, run quick for clothes. END
BEGIN NOW And haven't you some dry clothes? END
BEGIN NOW she asked the butler. END
BEGIN NOW The butler gesticulated as though to say, Is it likely for such a size?\. END
BEGIN NOW But we could get a coverlet, he replied, or, there's a new horse-rug. END
BEGIN NOW But get up, get up, Martin Petrovitch, sit down, repeated my mother. END
BEGIN NOW They've turned me out, madam, Harlov moaned suddenly, and he flung his head back and stretched his hands out before him. END
BEGIN NOW They've turned me out, Natalia Nikolaevna! END
BEGIN NOW My own daughters, out of my own home.\. END
BEGIN NOW My mother sighed and groaned. END
BEGIN NOW What are you saying? END
BEGIN NOW Turned you out! END
BEGIN NOW What wickedness! END
BEGIN NOW what wickedness! END
BEGIN NOW (She crossed herself.) END
BEGIN NOW But do get up, Martin Petrovitch, I beg you! END
BEGIN NOW Two maid-servants came in with cloths and stood still before Harlov. END
BEGIN NOW It was clear they did not know how to attack this mountain of filth. END
BEGIN NOW They have turned me out, madam, they have turned me out! END
BEGIN NOW Harlov kept repeating meanwhile. END
BEGIN NOW The butler returned with a large woollen coverlet, and he, too, stood still in perplexity. END
BEGIN NOW Souvenir's little head was thrust in at a door and vanished again. END
BEGIN NOW Martin Petrovitch! END
BEGIN NOW get up! END
BEGIN NOW Sit down! END
BEGIN NOW and tell me everything properly, my mother commanded in a tone of determination. END
BEGIN NOW Harlov rose.\. END
BEGIN NOW The butler tried to assist him but only dirtied his hand, and, shaking his fingers, retreated to the door. END
BEGIN NOW Staggering and faltering, Harlov got to a chair and sat down. END
BEGIN NOW The maids again approached him with their cloths, but he waved them off with his hand, and refused the coverlet. END
BEGIN NOW My mother did not herself, indeed, insist; to dry Harlov was obviously out of the question; they contented themselves with hastily wiping up his traces on the floor. END
BEGIN NOW How have they turned you out? END
BEGIN NOW my mother asked, as soon as he had a little time to recover himself. END
BEGIN NOW Madam! END
BEGIN NOW Natalia Nikolaevna! END
BEGIN NOW he began, in a strained voice,&mdash;and again I was struck by the uneasy straying of his eyes; I will tell you the truth; I am myself most of all to blame. END
BEGIN NOW Ay, to be sure; you would not listen to me at the time, assented my mother, sinking into an arm-chair and slightly moving a scented handkerchief before her nose; very strong was the smell that came from Harlov\. END
BEGIN NOW the odour in a forest bog is not so strong. END
BEGIN NOW Alas! END
BEGIN NOW that's not where I erred, madam, but through pride. END
BEGIN NOW Pride has been my ruin, as it ruined the Tsar Navuhodonosor. END
BEGIN NOW I fancied God had given me my full share of sense, and if I resolved on anything, it followed it was right; so\. END
BEGIN NOW and then the fear of death came\. END
BEGIN NOW I was utterly confounded! END
BEGIN NOW 'I'll show,' said I, 'to the last, my power and my strength! END
BEGIN NOW I'll bestow all on them,&mdash;and they must feel it all their lives.\.\.' END
BEGIN NOW (Harlov suddenly was shaking all over.\.\.) END
BEGIN NOW Like a mangy dog they have driven me out of the house! END
BEGIN NOW This is their gratitude! END
BEGIN NOW In what way&mdash;-, my mother was beginning.\. END
BEGIN NOW They took my page, Maximka, from me, Harlov interrupted her (his eyes were still wandering, he held both hands&mdash;the fingers interlaced&mdash;under his chin), my carriage they took away, my monthly allowance they cut down, did not pay me the sum specified, cut me short all round, in fact; still I said nothing, bore it all! END
BEGIN NOW And I bore it by reason.\. END
BEGIN NOW alas! END
BEGIN NOW of my pride again. END
BEGIN NOW That my cruel enemies might not say, 'See, the old fool's sorry for it now'; and you too, do you remember, madam, had warned me; 'mind you, it's all to no purpose,' you said! END
BEGIN NOW and so I bore it.\. END
BEGIN NOW Only, to-day I came into my room, and it was occupied already, and my bed they'd thrown out into the lumber-room! END
BEGIN NOW 'You can sleep there; we put up with you there even only out of charity; we've need of your room for the household.' END
BEGIN NOW And this was said to me by whom? END
BEGIN NOW Volodka Sletkin! END
BEGIN NOW the vile hound, the base cur! END
BEGIN NOW Harlov's voice broke. END
BEGIN NOW But your daughters? END
BEGIN NOW What did they do? END
BEGIN NOW asked my mother. END
BEGIN NOW But I bore it all, Harlov went on again; bitterness, bitterness was in my heart, let me tell you, and shame.\. END
BEGIN NOW I could not bear to look upon the light of day! END
BEGIN NOW That was why I was unwilling to come and see you, ma'am, from this same feeling, from shame for my disgrace! END
BEGIN NOW I have tried everything, my good friend; kindness, affection, and threats, and I reasoned with them, and more besides! END
BEGIN NOW I bowed down before them\. END
BEGIN NOW like this. END
BEGIN NOW (Harlov showed how he had bowed down.) END
BEGIN NOW And all in vain. END
BEGIN NOW And all of it I bore! END
BEGIN NOW At the beginning, at first, I'd very different thoughts; I'll up, I thought, and kill them. END
BEGIN NOW I'll crush them all, so that not a trace remains of them!\. END
BEGIN NOW I'll let them know! END
BEGIN NOW Well, but after, I submitted! END
BEGIN NOW It's a cross, I thought, laid upon me; it's to bid me make ready for death. END
BEGIN NOW And all at once, to-day, driven out, like a cur! END
BEGIN NOW And by whom? END
BEGIN NOW Volodka! END
BEGIN NOW And you asked about my daughters; they've no will of their own at all. END
BEGIN NOW They're Volodka's slaves! END
BEGIN NOW Yes! END
BEGIN NOW My mother wondered. END
BEGIN NOW In Anna's case I can understand that; she's a wife.\. END
BEGIN NOW But how comes it your second\. END
BEGIN NOW Evlampia? END
BEGIN NOW She's worse than Anna! END
BEGIN NOW She's altogether given herself up into Volodka's hands. END
BEGIN NOW That's the reason she refused your soldier, too. END
BEGIN NOW At his, at Volodka's bidding. END
BEGIN NOW Anna, to be sure, ought to resent it, and she can't bear her sister, but she submits! END
BEGIN NOW He's bewitched them, the cursed scoundrel! END
BEGIN NOW Though she, Anna, I daresay, is pleased to think that Evlampia, who was always so proud,&mdash;and now see what she's come to!\. END
BEGIN NOW O\. END
BEGIN NOW alas\. END
BEGIN NOW alas! END
BEGIN NOW God, my God! END
BEGIN NOW My mother looked uneasily towards me. END
BEGIN NOW I moved a little away as a precautionary measure, for fear I should be sent away altogether.\. END
BEGIN NOW I am very sorry indeed, Martin Petrovitch, she began, that my former protégé has caused you so much sorrow, and has turned out so badly. END
BEGIN NOW But I, too, was mistaken in him.\. END
BEGIN NOW Who could have expected this of him? END
BEGIN NOW Madam, Harlov moaned out, and he struck himself a blow on the chest, I cannot bear the ingratitude of my daughters! END
BEGIN NOW I cannot, madam! END
BEGIN NOW You know I gave them everything, everything! END
BEGIN NOW And besides, my conscience has been tormenting me. END
BEGIN NOW Many things\. END
BEGIN NOW alas! END
BEGIN NOW many things I have thought over, sitting by the pond, fishing. END
BEGIN NOW 'If you'd only done good to any one in your life!' END
BEGIN NOW was what I pondered upon, 'succoured the poor, set the peasants free, or something, to atone for having wrung their lives out of them. END
BEGIN NOW You must answer for them before God! END
BEGIN NOW Now their tears are revenged.' END
BEGIN NOW And what sort of life have they now? END
BEGIN NOW It was a deep pit even in my time&mdash;why disguise my sins?&mdash;but now there's no seeing the bottom! END
BEGIN NOW All these sins I have taken upon my soul; I have sacrificed my conscience for my children, and for this I'm laughed to scorn! END
BEGIN NOW Kicked out of the house, like a cur! END
BEGIN NOW Don't think about that, Martin Petrovitch, observed my mother. END
BEGIN NOW And when he told me, your Volodka, Harlov went on with fresh force, when he told me I was not to live in my room any more,&mdash;I laid every plank in that room with my own hands,&mdash;when he said that to me,&mdash;God only knows what passed within me! END
BEGIN NOW It was all confusion in my head, and like a knife in my heart.\. END
BEGIN NOW Either to cut his throat or get away out of the house!\. END
BEGIN NOW So, I have run to you, my benefactress, Natalia Nikolaevna\. END
BEGIN NOW where had I to lay my head? END
BEGIN NOW And then the rain, the filth\. END
BEGIN NOW I fell down twenty times, maybe! END
BEGIN NOW And now\. END
BEGIN NOW in such unseemly.\. END
BEGIN NOW Harlov scanned himself and moved restlessly in his chair, as though intending to get up. END
BEGIN NOW Say no more, Martin Petrovitch, my mother interposed hurriedly; what does that signify? END
BEGIN NOW That you've made the floor dirty? END
BEGIN NOW That's no great matter! END
BEGIN NOW Come, I want to make you a proposition. END
BEGIN NOW Listen! END
BEGIN NOW They shall take you now to a special room, and make you up a clean bed,&mdash;you undress, wash, and lie down and sleep a little.\. END
BEGIN NOW Natalia Nikolaevna! END
BEGIN NOW There's no sleeping for me! END
BEGIN NOW Harlov responded drearily. END
BEGIN NOW It's as though there were hammers beating in my brain! END
BEGIN NOW Me! END
BEGIN NOW like some good-for-nothing beast!\. END
BEGIN NOW Lie down and sleep, my mother repeated insistently. END
BEGIN NOW And then we'll give you some tea,&mdash;yes, and we'll have a talk. END
BEGIN NOW Don't lose heart, old friend! END
BEGIN NOW If they've driven you out of your house, in my house you will always find a home.\. END
BEGIN NOW I have not forgotten, you know, that you saved my life. END
BEGIN NOW Benefactress! END
BEGIN NOW moaned Harlov, and he covered his face with his hand. END
BEGIN NOW You must save me now! END
BEGIN NOW This appeal touched my mother almost to tears. END
BEGIN NOW I am ready and eager to help you, Martin Petrovitch, in everything I am able. END
BEGIN NOW But you must promise me that you will listen to me in future and dismiss every evil thought from you. END
BEGIN NOW Harlov took his hands from his face. END
BEGIN NOW If need be, he said, I can forgive them, even! END
BEGIN NOW My mother nodded her head approvingly. END
BEGIN NOW I am very glad to see you in such a truly Christian frame of mind, Martin Petrovitch; but we will talk of that later. END
BEGIN NOW Meanwhile, you put yourself to rights, and, most of all, sleep. END
BEGIN NOW Take Martin Petrovitch to what was the master's room, the green room, said my mother, addressing the butler, and whatever he asks for, let him have it on the spot! END
BEGIN NOW Give orders for his clothes to be dried and washed, and ask the housekeeper for what linen is needed. END
BEGIN NOW Do you hear? END
BEGIN NOW Yes, madam, responded the butler. END
BEGIN NOW And as soon as he's asleep, tell the tailor to take his measure; and his beard will have to be shaved. END
BEGIN NOW Not at once, but after. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, madam, repeated the butler. END
BEGIN NOW Martin Petrovitch, kindly come. END
BEGIN NOW Harlov got up, looked at my mother, was about to go up to her, but stopped, swinging a bow from the waist, crossed himself three times to the image, and followed the steward. END
BEGIN NOW Behind him, I, too, slipped out of the room. END
BEGIN NOW THE butler conducted Harlov to the green room, and at once ran off for the wardroom maid, as it turned out there were no sheets on the bed. END
BEGIN NOW Souvenir, who met us in the passage, and popped into the green room with us, promptly proceeded to dance, grinning and chuckling, round Harlov, who stood, his arms held a little away from him, and his legs apart, in the middle of the room, seeming lost in thought. END
BEGIN NOW The water was still dripping from him. END
BEGIN NOW The Swede! END
BEGIN NOW The Swede, Harlus! END
BEGIN NOW piped Souvenir, doubling up and holding his sides. END
BEGIN NOW Mighty founder of the illustrious race of Harlovs, look down on thy descendant! END
BEGIN NOW What does he look like? END
BEGIN NOW Dost thou recognise him? END
BEGIN NOW Ha, ha, ha! END
BEGIN NOW Your excellency, your hand, I beg; why, have you got on black gloves? END
BEGIN NOW I tried to restrain Souvenir, to put him to shame\. END
BEGIN NOW but it was too late for that now. END
BEGIN NOW He called me parasite, toady! END
BEGIN NOW 'You've no roof,' said he, 'to call your own.' END
BEGIN NOW But now, no doubt about it, he's become as dependent as poor little me. END
BEGIN NOW Martin Petrovitch and Souvenir, the poor toady, are equal now. END
BEGIN NOW He'll have to live on charity too. END
BEGIN NOW They'll toss him the stale and dirty crust, that the dog has sniffed at and refused.\. END
BEGIN NOW And they'll tell him to eat it, too. END
BEGIN NOW Ha, ha, ha! END
BEGIN NOW Harlov still stood motionless, his head drawn in, his legs and arms held a little apart. END
BEGIN NOW Martin Harlov, a nobleman born! END
BEGIN NOW Souvenir went on shrieking. END
BEGIN NOW What airs he used to give himself. END
BEGIN NOW Just look at me! END
BEGIN NOW Don't come near, or I'll knock you down!\. END
BEGIN NOW And when he was so clever as to give away and divide his property, didn't he crow! END
BEGIN NOW 'Gratitude!\.\.' END
BEGIN NOW he cackled, 'gratitude!' END
BEGIN NOW But why were you so mean to me? END
BEGIN NOW Why didn't you make me a present? END
BEGIN NOW May be, I should have felt it more. END
BEGIN NOW And you see I was right when I said they'd strip you bare, and\. END
BEGIN NOW Souvenir! END
BEGIN NOW I screamed; but Souvenir was in nowise daunted. END
BEGIN NOW Harlov still did not stir. END
BEGIN NOW It seemed as though he were only now beginning to be aware how soaking wet everything was that he had on, and was waiting to be helped off with his clothes. END
BEGIN NOW But the butler had not come back. END
BEGIN NOW And a military man too! END
BEGIN NOW Souvenir began again. END
BEGIN NOW In the year twelve, he saved his country; he showed proofs of his valour. END
BEGIN NOW I see how it is. END
BEGIN NOW Stripping the frozen marauders of their breeches is work he's quite equal to, but when the hussies stamp their feet at him he's frightened out of his skin. END
BEGIN NOW Souvenir! END
BEGIN NOW I screamed a second time. END
BEGIN NOW Harlov looked askance at Souvenir. END
BEGIN NOW Till that instant he seemed not to have noticed his presence, and only my exclamation aroused his attention. END
BEGIN NOW Look out, brother, he growled huskily, don't dance yourself into trouble. END
BEGIN NOW Souvenir fairly rolled about with laughter. END
BEGIN NOW Ah, how you frighten me, most honoured brother. END
BEGIN NOW You're a formidable person, to be sure. END
BEGIN NOW You must comb your hair, at any rate, or, God forbid, it'll get dry, and you'll never wash it clean again; you'll have to mow it with a sickle. END
BEGIN NOW Souvenir all of a sudden got into a fury. END
BEGIN NOW And you give yourself airs still. END
BEGIN NOW A poor outcast, and he gives himself airs. END
BEGIN NOW Where's your home now? END
BEGIN NOW you'd better tell me that, you were always boasting of it. END
BEGIN NOW 'I have a home of my own,' he used to say, but you're homeless. END
BEGIN NOW 'My ancestral roof,' he would say. END
BEGIN NOW Souvenir pounced on this phrase as an inspiration. END
BEGIN NOW Mr. Bitchkov, I protested. END
BEGIN NOW What are you about? END
BEGIN NOW you forget yourself. END
BEGIN NOW But he still persisted in chattering, and still danced and pranced up and down quite close to Harlov. END
BEGIN NOW And still the butler and the wardroom maid did not come. END
BEGIN NOW I felt alarmed. END
BEGIN NOW I began to notice that Harlov, who had, during his conversation with my mother, gradually grown quieter, and even towards the end apparently resigned himself to his fate, was beginning to get worked up again. END
BEGIN NOW He breathed more hurriedly, it seemed as though his face were suddenly swollen under his ears, his fingers twitched, his eyes again began moving restlessly in the dark mask of his grim face.\. END
BEGIN NOW Souvenir, Souvenir! END
BEGIN NOW I cried. END
BEGIN NOW Stop it, I'll tell mamma. END
BEGIN NOW But Souvenir seemed possessed by frenzy. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, yes, most honoured brother, he began again, here we find ourselves, you and I, in the most delicate position. END
BEGIN NOW While your daughters, with your son-in-law, Vladimir Vassilievitch, are having a fine laugh at you under your roof. END
BEGIN NOW And you should at least curse them, as you promised. END
BEGIN NOW Even that you're not equal to. END
BEGIN NOW To be sure, how could you hold your own with Vladimir Vassilievitch? END
BEGIN NOW Why, you used to call him Volodka, too. END
BEGIN NOW You call him Volodka. END
BEGIN NOW He is Vladimir Vassilievitch, Mr. Sletkin, a landowner, a gentleman, while&mdash;what are you, pray? END
BEGIN NOW A furious roar drowned Souvenir's words.\. END
BEGIN NOW Harlov was aroused. END
BEGIN NOW His fists were clenched and lifted, his face was purple, there was foam on his drawn lips, he was shaking with rage. END
BEGIN NOW Roof, you say! END
BEGIN NOW he thundered in his iron voice, curse, you say.\. END
BEGIN NOW No! END
BEGIN NOW I will not curse them.\. END
BEGIN NOW They don't care for that\. END
BEGIN NOW But the roof\. END
BEGIN NOW I will tear the roof off them, and they shall have no roof over their heads, like me. END
BEGIN NOW They shall learn to know Martin Harlov. END
BEGIN NOW My strength is not all gone yet; they shall learn to laugh at me!\. END
BEGIN NOW They shall have no roof over their heads! END
BEGIN NOW I was stupefied; never in my life had I witnessed such boundless anger. END
BEGIN NOW Not a man&mdash;a wild beast&mdash;paced to and fro before me. END
BEGIN NOW I was stupefied\. END
BEGIN NOW as for Souvenir, he had hidden under the table in his fright. END
BEGIN NOW They shall not! END
BEGIN NOW Harlov shouted for the last time, and almost knocking over the butler and the wardroom maid, he rushed away out of the house.\. END
BEGIN NOW He dashed headlong across the yard, and vanished through the gates. END
BEGIN NOW MY mother was terribly angry when the butler came with an abashed countenance to report Martin Petrovitch's sudden and unexpected retreat. END
BEGIN NOW He did not dare to conceal the cause of this retreat; I was obliged to confirm his story. END
BEGIN NOW Then it was all your doing! END
BEGIN NOW my mother cried, at the sight of Souvenir, who had run in like a hare, and was even approaching to kiss her hand: Your vile tongue is to blame for it all! END
BEGIN NOW Excuse me, d'rectly, d'rectly\. END
BEGIN NOW faltered Souvenir, stuttering and drawing back his elbows behind him. END
BEGIN NOW D'rectly,\. END
BEGIN NOW d'rectly\. END
BEGIN NOW I know your 'd'rectly,' my mother repeated reprovingly, and she sent him out of the room. END
BEGIN NOW Then she rang the bell, sent for Kvitsinsky, and gave him orders to set off on the spot to Eskovo, with a carriage, to find Martin Petrovitch at all costs, and to bring him back. END
BEGIN NOW Do not let me see you without him, she concluded. END
BEGIN NOW The gloomy Pole bowed his head without a word, and went away. END
BEGIN NOW I went back to my own room, sat down again at the window, and I pondered a long while, I remember, on what had taken place before my eyes. END
BEGIN NOW I was puzzled; I could not understand how it was that Harlov, who had endured the insults of his own family almost without a murmur, had lost all self-control, and been unable to put up with the jeers and pin-pricks of such an abject creature as Souvenir. END
BEGIN NOW I did not understand in those days what insufferable bitterness there may sometimes be in a foolish taunt, even when it comes from lips one scorns.\. END
BEGIN NOW The hated name of Sletkin, uttered by Souvenir, had been like a spark thrown into powder. END
BEGIN NOW The sore spot could not endure this final prick. END
BEGIN NOW About an hour passed by. END
BEGIN NOW Our coach drove into the yard; but our steward sat in it alone. END
BEGIN NOW And my mother had said to him&mdash; don't let me see you without him. END
BEGIN NOW Kvitsinsky jumped hurriedly out of the carriage, and ran up the steps. END
BEGIN NOW His face had a perturbed look&mdash;something very unusual with him. END
BEGIN NOW I promptly rushed downstairs, and followed at his heels into the drawing-room. END
BEGIN NOW Well? END
BEGIN NOW have you brought him? END
BEGIN NOW asked my mother. END
BEGIN NOW I have not brought him, answered Kvitsinsky&mdash; and I could not bring him. END
BEGIN NOW How's that? END
BEGIN NOW Have you seen him? END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW What has happened to him? END
BEGIN NOW A fit? END
BEGIN NOW No; nothing has happened. END
BEGIN NOW How is it you didn't bring him? END
BEGIN NOW He's pulling his house to pieces. END
BEGIN NOW What? END
BEGIN NOW He's standing on the roof of the new building, and pulling it to pieces. END
BEGIN NOW Forty boards or more, I should guess, must have come down by now, and some five of the rafters too. END
BEGIN NOW ( They shall not have a roof over their heads. END
BEGIN NOW Harlov's words came back to me.) END
BEGIN NOW My mother stared at Kvitsinsky. END
BEGIN NOW Alone\. END
BEGIN NOW he's standing on the roof, and pulling the roof down? END
BEGIN NOW Exactly so. END
BEGIN NOW He is walking about on the flooring of the garret in the roof, and smashing right and left of him. END
BEGIN NOW His strength, you are aware, madam, is superhuman. END
BEGIN NOW And the roof too, one must say, is a poor affair; half-inch deal battens, laid wide apart, one inch nails. END
BEGIN NOW My mother looked at me, as though wishing to make sure whether she had heard aright. END
BEGIN NOW Half-inches wide apart, she repeated, obviously not understanding the meaning of one word. END
BEGIN NOW Well, what then? END
BEGIN NOW she said at last. END
BEGIN NOW I have come for instructions. END
BEGIN NOW There's no doing anything without men to help. END
BEGIN NOW The peasants there are all limp with fright. END
BEGIN NOW And his daughters&mdash;what of them? END
BEGIN NOW His daughters are doing nothing. END
BEGIN NOW They're running to and fro, shouting\. END
BEGIN NOW this and that\. END
BEGIN NOW all to no purpose. END
BEGIN NOW And is Sletkin there? END
BEGIN NOW He's there too. END
BEGIN NOW He's making more outcry than all of them&mdash;but he can't do anything. END
BEGIN NOW And Martin Petrovitch is standing on the roof? END
BEGIN NOW On the roof\. END
BEGIN NOW that is, in the garret&mdash;and pulling the roof to pieces. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, yes, said my mother, half-inches wide apart. END
BEGIN NOW The position was obviously a serious one. END
BEGIN NOW What steps were to be taken? END
BEGIN NOW Send to the town for the police captain? END
BEGIN NOW Get together the peasants? END
BEGIN NOW My mother was quite at her wits' end. END
BEGIN NOW Zhitkov, who had come in to dinner, was nonplussed too. END
BEGIN NOW It is true, he made another reference to a battalion of military; he offered no advice, however, but confined himself to looking submissive and devoted. END
BEGIN NOW Kvitsinsky, seeing he would not get at any instructions, suggested to my mother&mdash;with the contemptuous respectfulness peculiar to him&mdash;that if she would authorise him to take a few of the stable-boys, gardeners, and other house-serfs, he would make an effort\. END
BEGIN NOW Yes, yes, my mother cut him short, do make an effort, dear Vikenty Osipitch! END
BEGIN NOW Only make haste, please, and I will take all responsibility on myself! END
BEGIN NOW Kvitsinsky smiled coldly. END
BEGIN NOW One thing let me make clear, madam, beforehand; it s impossible to reckon on any result, seeing that Mr. Harlov's strength is so great, and he is so desperate too; he feels himself to have been very cruelly wronged! END
BEGIN NOW Yes, yes, my mother assented; and it's all that vile Souvenir's fault! END
BEGIN NOW Never will I forgive him for it. END
BEGIN NOW Go and take the servants and set off, Vikenty Osipitch! END
BEGIN NOW You'd better take plenty of cord, Mr. END
BEGIN NOW Steward, and some fire-escape tackle, Zhitkov brought out in his bass&mdash; and if there is such a thing as a net, it would be as well to take that along too. END
BEGIN NOW We once had in our regiment\. END
BEGIN NOW Kindly refrain from instructing me, sir, Kvitsinsky cut him short, with an air of vexation; I know what is needed without your aid. END
BEGIN NOW Zhitkov was offended, and protested that as he imagined he, too, was called upon\. END
BEGIN NOW No, no! END
BEGIN NOW interposed my mother; you'd better stop where you are\. END
BEGIN NOW Let Vikenty Osipitch act alone\. END
BEGIN NOW Make haste, Vikenty Osipitch! END
BEGIN NOW Zhitkov was still more offended, while Kvitsinsky bowed and went out. END
BEGIN NOW I rushed off to the stable, hurriedly saddled my horse myself, and set off at a gallop along the road to Eskovo. END
BEGIN NOW THE rain had ceased, but the wind was blowing with redoubled force&mdash;straight into my face. END
BEGIN NOW Half-way there, the saddle almost slipped round under me; the girth had got loose; I got off and tried to tighten the straps with my teeth.\. END
BEGIN NOW All at once I heard someone calling me by my name\. END
BEGIN NOW Souvenir was running towards me across the green fields. END
BEGIN NOW What! END
BEGIN NOW he shouted to me from some way off, was your curiosity too much for you? END
BEGIN NOW But it's no use\. END
BEGIN NOW I went over there, straight, at Harlov's heels\. END
BEGIN NOW Such a state of things you never saw in your life! END
BEGIN NOW You want to enjoy what you have done, I said indignantly, and, jumping on my horse, I set off again at a gallop. END
BEGIN NOW But the indefatigable Souvenir did not give me up, and chuckled and grinned, even as he ran. END
BEGIN NOW At last, Eskovo was reached&mdash;there was the dam, and there the long hedge and willow-tree of the homestead\. END
BEGIN NOW I rode up to the gate, dismounted, tied up my horse, and stood still in amazement. END
BEGIN NOW Of one third of the roof of the newer house, of the front part, nothing was left but the skeleton; boards and litter lay in disorderly heaps on the ground on both sides of the building. END
BEGIN NOW Even supposing the roof to be, as Kvitsinsky had said, a poor affair, even so, it was something incredible! END
BEGIN NOW On the floor of the garret, in a whirl of dust and rubbish, a blackish grey mass was moving to and fro with rapid ungainly action, at one moment shaking the remaining chimney, built of brick, (the other had fallen already) then tearing up the boarding and flinging it down below, then clutching at the very rafters. END
BEGIN NOW It was Harlov. END
BEGIN NOW He struck me as being exactly like a bear at this moment too; the head, and back, and shoulders were a bear's, and he put his feet down wide apart without bending the insteps&mdash;also like a bear. END
BEGIN NOW The bitter wind was blowing upon him from every side, lifting his matted locks. END
BEGIN NOW It was horrible to see, here and there, red patches of bare flesh through the rents in his tattered clothes; it was horrible to hear his wild husky muttering. END
BEGIN NOW There were a lot of people in the yard; peasant-women, boys, and servant-girls stood close along the hedge. END
BEGIN NOW A few peasants huddled together in a separate group, a little way off. END
BEGIN NOW The old village priest, whom I knew, was standing, bareheaded, on the steps of the other house, and holding a brazen cross in both hands, from time to time, silently and hopelessly, raised it, and, as it were, showed it to Harlov. END
BEGIN NOW Beside the priest, stood Evlampia with her back against the wall, gazing fixedly at her father. END
BEGIN NOW Anna, at one moment, pushed her head out of the little window, then vanished, then hurried into the yard, then went back into the house. END
BEGIN NOW Sletkin&mdash;pale all over, livid&mdash;in an old dressing-gown and smoking-cap, with a single-barrelled rifle in his hands, kept running to and fro with little steps. END
BEGIN NOW He had completely gone Jewish, as it is called. END
BEGIN NOW He was gasping, threatening, shaking, pointing the gun at Harlov, then letting it drop back on his shoulder&mdash;pointing it again, shrieking, weeping.\. END
BEGIN NOW On seeing Souvenir and me he simply flew to us. END
BEGIN NOW Look, look, what is going on here! END
BEGIN NOW he wailed&mdash; look! END
BEGIN NOW He's gone out of his mind, he's raving mad\. END
BEGIN NOW and see what he's doing! END
BEGIN NOW I've sent for the police already&mdash;but no one comes! END
BEGIN NOW No one comes! END
BEGIN NOW If I do fire at him, the law couldn't touch me, for every man has a right to defend his own property! END
BEGIN NOW And I will fire!\.\. END
BEGIN NOW By God, I'll fire! END
BEGIN NOW He ran off toward the house. END
BEGIN NOW Martin Petrovitch, look out! END
BEGIN NOW If you don't get down, I'll fire! END
BEGIN NOW Fire away! END
BEGIN NOW came a husky voice from the roof. END
BEGIN NOW Fire away! END
BEGIN NOW And meanwhile here's a little present for you! END
BEGIN NOW A long plank flew up, and, turning over twice in the air, came violently to the earth, just at Sletkin's feet. END
BEGIN NOW He positively jumped into the air, while Harlov chuckled. END
BEGIN NOW Merciful Jesus! END
BEGIN NOW faltered some one behind me. END
BEGIN NOW I looked round: Souvenir. END
BEGIN NOW Ah! END
BEGIN NOW I thought, he's left off laughing now! END
BEGIN NOW Sletkin clutched a peasant, who was standing near, by the collar. END
BEGIN NOW Climb up now, climb up, climb up, all of you, you devils, he wailed, shaking the man with all his force, save my property! END
BEGIN NOW The peasant took a couple of steps forward, threw his head back, waved his arms, shouted&mdash; Hi! END
BEGIN NOW here master! END
BEGIN NOW shifted from one foot to the other uneasily, and then turned back. END
BEGIN NOW A ladder! END
BEGIN NOW bring a ladder! END
BEGIN NOW Sletkin addressed the other peasants. END
BEGIN NOW Where are we to get it? END
BEGIN NOW was heard in answer. END
BEGIN NOW And if we had a ladder, one voice pronounced deliberately, who'd care to climb up? END
BEGIN NOW Not such fools! END
BEGIN NOW He'd wring your neck for you&mdash;in a twinkling! END
BEGIN NOW He'd kill one in no time, said one young lad with flaxen hair and a half-idiotic face. END
BEGIN NOW To be sure he would, the others confirmed. END
BEGIN NOW It struck me that, even if there had been no obvious danger, the peasants would yet have been loath to carry out their new owner's orders. END
BEGIN NOW They almost approved of Harlov, though they were amazed at him. END
BEGIN NOW Ugh, you robbers! END
BEGIN NOW moaned Sletkin; you shall all catch it\. END
BEGIN NOW But at this moment, with a heavy rumble, the last chimney came crashing down, and, in the midst of the cloud of yellow dust that flew up instantly, Harlov&mdash;uttering a piercing shriek and lifting his bleeding hands high in the air&mdash;turned facing us. END
BEGIN NOW Sletkin pointed the gun at him again. END
BEGIN NOW Evlampia pulled him back by the elbow. END
BEGIN NOW Don't interfere! END
BEGIN NOW he snarled savagely at her. END
BEGIN NOW And you&mdash;don't you dare! END
BEGIN NOW she answered; and her blue eyes flashed menacingly under her scowling brows. END
BEGIN NOW Father's pulling his house down. END
BEGIN NOW It's his own. END
BEGIN NOW You lie: it's ours! END
BEGIN NOW You say ours; but I say it's his. END
BEGIN NOW Sletkin hissed with fury; Evlampia's eyes seemed stabbing him in the face. END
BEGIN NOW Ah, how d'ye do! END
BEGIN NOW my delightful daughter! END
BEGIN NOW Harlov thundered from above. END
BEGIN NOW How d'ye do! END
BEGIN NOW Evlampia Martinovna! END
BEGIN NOW How are you getting on with your sweetheart? END
BEGIN NOW Are your kisses sweet, and your fondling? END
BEGIN NOW Father! END
BEGIN NOW rang out Evlampia's musical voice. END
BEGIN NOW Eh, daughter? END
BEGIN NOW answered Harlov; and he came down to the very edge of the wall. END
BEGIN NOW His face, as far as I could make it out, wore a strange smile, a bright, mirthful&mdash;and for that very reason peculiarly strange and evil&mdash;smile.\. END
BEGIN NOW Many years later I saw just the same smile on the face of a man condemned to death. END
BEGIN NOW Stop, father; come down. END
BEGIN NOW We are in fault; we give everything back to you. END
BEGIN NOW Come down. END
BEGIN NOW What do you mean by disposing of what's ours? END
BEGIN NOW put in Sletkin. END
BEGIN NOW Evlampia merely scowled more angrily. END
BEGIN NOW I give you back my share. END
BEGIN NOW I give up everything. END
BEGIN NOW Give over, come down, father! END
BEGIN NOW Forgive us; forgive me. END
BEGIN NOW Harlov still went on smiling. END
BEGIN NOW It's too late, my darling, he said, and each of his words rang out like brass. END
BEGIN NOW Too late your stony heart is touched! END
BEGIN NOW The rock's started rolling downhill&mdash;there's no holding it back now! END
BEGIN NOW And don't look to me now; I'm a doomed man! END
BEGIN NOW You'd do better to look to your Volodka; see what a pretty fellow you've picked out! END
BEGIN NOW And look to your hellish sister; there's her foxy nose yonder thrust out of the window; she's peering yonder after that husband of hers! END
BEGIN NOW No, my good friends; you would rob me of a roof over my head, so I will leave you not one beam upon another! END
BEGIN NOW With my own hands I built it, with my own hands I destroy it,&mdash;yes, with my hands alone! END
BEGIN NOW See, I've taken no axe to help me! END
BEGIN NOW He snorted at his two open hands, and clutched at the centre beam again. END
BEGIN NOW Enough, father, Evlampia was saying meanwhile, and her voice had grown marvellously caressing, let bygones be bygones. END
BEGIN NOW Come, trust me; you always trusted me. END
BEGIN NOW Come, get down; come to me to my little room, to my soft bed. END
BEGIN NOW I will dry you and warm you; I will bind up your wounds; see, you have torn your hands. END
BEGIN NOW You shall live with me as in Christ's bosom; food shall be sweet to you&mdash;and sleep sweeter yet. END
BEGIN NOW Come, we have done wrong! END
BEGIN NOW yes, we were puffed up, we have sinned; come, forgive! END
BEGIN NOW Harlov shook his head. END
BEGIN NOW Talk away! END
BEGIN NOW Me believe you! END
BEGIN NOW Never again! END
BEGIN NOW You've murdered all trust in my heart! END
BEGIN NOW You've murdered everything! END
BEGIN NOW I was an eagle, and became a worm for you\. END
BEGIN NOW and you,&mdash;would you even crush the worm? END
BEGIN NOW Have done! END
BEGIN NOW I loved you, you know very well,&mdash;but now you are no daughter to me, and I'm no father to you\. END
BEGIN NOW I'm a doomed man! END
BEGIN NOW Don't meddle! END
BEGIN NOW As for you, fire away, coward, mighty man of valour! END
BEGIN NOW Harlov bellowed suddenly at Sletkin. END
BEGIN NOW Why is it you keep aiming and don't shoot? END
BEGIN NOW Are you mindful of the law; if the recipient of a gift commits an attempt upon the life of the giver, Harlov enunciated distinctly, then the giver is empowered to claim everything back again? END
BEGIN NOW Ha, ha! END
BEGIN NOW don't be afraid, law-abiding man! END
BEGIN NOW I'd make no claims. END
BEGIN NOW I'll make an end of everything myself.\. END
BEGIN NOW Here goes! END
BEGIN NOW Father! END
BEGIN NOW for the last time Evlampia besought him. END
BEGIN NOW Silence! END
BEGIN NOW Martin Petrovitch! END
BEGIN NOW brother, be generous and forgive! END
BEGIN NOW faltered Souvenir. END
BEGIN NOW Father! END
BEGIN NOW dear father! END
BEGIN NOW Silence, bitch! END
BEGIN NOW shouted Harlov. END
BEGIN NOW At Souvenir he did not even glance,&mdash;he merely spat in his direction. END
BEGIN NOW AT that instant, Kvitsinsky, with all his retinue&mdash;in three carts&mdash;appeared at the gates. END
BEGIN NOW The tired horses panted, the men jumped out, one after another, into the mud. END
BEGIN NOW Aha! END
BEGIN NOW Harlov shouted at the top of his voice. END
BEGIN NOW An army\. END
BEGIN NOW here it comes, an army! END
BEGIN NOW A whole army they're sending against me! END
BEGIN NOW Capital! END
BEGIN NOW Only I give warning&mdash;if any one comes up here to me on the roof, I'll send him flying down, head over heels! END
BEGIN NOW I'm an inhospitable master; I don't like visitors at wrong times! END
BEGIN NOW No indeed! END
BEGIN NOW He was hanging with both hands on to the front rafters of the roof, the so-called standards of the gable, and beginning to shake them violently. END
BEGIN NOW Balancing on the edge of the garret flooring, he dragged them, as it were, after him, chanting rhythmically like a bargeman, One more pull! END
BEGIN NOW one more! END
BEGIN NOW o-oh! END
BEGIN NOW Sletkin ran up to Kvitsinsky and was beginning to whimper and pour out complaints.\. END
BEGIN NOW The latter begged him not to interfere, and proceeded to carry out the plan he had evolved. END
BEGIN NOW He took up his position in front of the house, and began, by way of diversion, to explain to Harlov that what he was about was unworthy of his rank.\. END
BEGIN NOW One more pull! END
BEGIN NOW one more! END
BEGIN NOW chanted Harlov.\. END
BEGIN NOW That Natalia Nikolaevna was greatly displeased at his proceedings, and had not expected it of him.\. END
BEGIN NOW One more pull! END
BEGIN NOW one more! END
BEGIN NOW o-oh! END
BEGIN NOW Harlov chanted\. END
BEGIN NOW while, meantime, Kvitsinsky had despatched the four sturdiest and boldest of the stable-boys to the other side of the house to clamber up the roof from behind. END
BEGIN NOW Harlov, however, detected the plan of attack; he suddenly left the standards and ran quickly to the back part of the roof. END
BEGIN NOW His appearance was so alarming that the two stable-boys who had already got up to the garret, dropped instantly back again to the ground by the water-pipe, to the great glee of the serf boys, who positively roared with laughter. END
BEGIN NOW Harlov shook his fist after them and, going back to the front part of the house, again clutched at the standards and began once more loosening them, singing again, like a bargeman. END
BEGIN NOW Suddenly he stopped, stared.\. END
BEGIN NOW Maximushka, my dear! END
BEGIN NOW my friend! END
BEGIN NOW he cried; is it you? END
BEGIN NOW I looked round.\. END
BEGIN NOW There, actually, was Maximka, stepping out from the crowd of peasants. END
BEGIN NOW Grinning and showing his teeth, he walked forward. END
BEGIN NOW His master, the tailor, had probably let him come home for a holiday. END
BEGIN NOW Climb up to me, Maximushka, my faithful servant, Harlov went on; together let us rid ourselves of evil Tartar folk, of Lithuanian thieves! END
BEGIN NOW Maximka, still grinning, promptly began climbing up the roof.\. END
BEGIN NOW But they seized him and pulled him back&mdash;goodness knows why; possibly as an example to the rest; he could hardly have been much aid to Martin Petrovitch. END
BEGIN NOW Oh, all right! END
BEGIN NOW Good! END
BEGIN NOW Harlov pronounced, in a voice of menace, and again he took hold of the standards. END
BEGIN NOW Vikenty Osipovitch! END
BEGIN NOW with your permission, I'll shoot, Sletkin turned to Kvitsinsky; more to frighten him, see, than anything; my gun's only charged with snipe-shot. END
BEGIN NOW But Kvitsinsky had not time to answer him, when the front couple of standards, viciously shaken in Harlov's iron hands, heeled over with a loud crack and crashed into the yard; and with it, not able to stop himself, came Harlov too, and fell with a heavy thud on the earth. END
BEGIN NOW Every one shuddered and drew a deep breath.\. END
BEGIN NOW Harlov lay without stirring on his breast, and on his back lay the top central beam of the roof, which had come down with the falling gable's timbers. END
BEGIN NOW THEY ran up to Harlov, rolled the beam off him, turned him over on his back. END
BEGIN NOW His face was lifeless, there was blood about his mouth; he did not seem to breathe. END
BEGIN NOW The breath is gone out of him, muttered the peasants, standing about him. END
BEGIN NOW They ran to the well for water, brought a whole bucketful, and drenched Harlov's head. END
BEGIN NOW The mud and dust ran off his face, but he looked as lifeless as ever. END
BEGIN NOW They dragged up a bench, set it in the house itself, and with difficulty raising the huge body of Martin Petrovitch, laid it there with the head to the wall. END
BEGIN NOW The page Maximka approached, fell on one knee, and, his other leg stretched far behind him, in a theatrical way, supported his former master's arm. END
BEGIN NOW Evlampia, pale as death, stood directly facing her father, her great eyes fastened immovably upon him. END
BEGIN NOW Anna and Sletkin did not come near him. END
BEGIN NOW All were silent, all, as it were, waited for something. END
BEGIN NOW At last we heard broken, smacking noises in Harlov's throat, as though he were swallowing.\. END
BEGIN NOW Then he feebly moved one, his right, hand (Maximka supported the left), opened one, the right eye, and slowly gazing about him, as though drunken with some fearful drunkenness, groaned, articulated, stammering, I'm sma-ashed\. END
BEGIN NOW and as though after a moment's thought, added, here it is, the ra.\. END
BEGIN NOW aven co.\. END
BEGIN NOW olt! END
BEGIN NOW The blood suddenly gushed thickly from his mouth\. END
BEGIN NOW his whole body began to quiver.\. END
BEGIN NOW The end! END
BEGIN NOW I thought.\. END
BEGIN NOW But once more Harlov opened the same eye (the left eyelid lay as motionless as on a dead man's face), and fixing it on Evlampia, he articulated, hardly above a breath, Well, daugh.\. END
BEGIN NOW ter\. END
BEGIN NOW you, I do not\. END
BEGIN NOW Kvitsinsky, with a sharp motion of his hand, beckoned to the priest, who was still standing on the step.\. END
BEGIN NOW The old man came up, his narrow cassock clinging about his feeble knees. END
BEGIN NOW But suddenly there was a sort of horrible twitching in Harlov's legs and in his stomach too; an irregular contraction passed upwards over his face. END
BEGIN NOW Evlampia's face seemed quivering and working in the same way. END
BEGIN NOW Maximka began crossing himself\. END
BEGIN NOW I was seized with horror; I ran out to the gates, squeezed myself close to them, not looking round. END
BEGIN NOW A minute later a soft murmur ran through the crowd, behind my back, and I understood that Martin Petrovitch was no more. END
BEGIN NOW His skull had been fractured by the beam and his ribs injured, as it appeared at the post-mortem examination. END
BEGIN NOW WHAT had he wanted to say to her as he lay dying? END
BEGIN NOW I asked myself as I went home on my cob: I do not\. END
BEGIN NOW forgive, or do not\. END
BEGIN NOW pardon. END
BEGIN NOW The rain had come on again, but I rode at a walking pace. END
BEGIN NOW I wanted to be alone as long as possible; I wanted to give myself up to my reflections, unchecked. END
BEGIN NOW Souvenir had gone back in one of the carts that had come with Kvitsinsky. END
BEGIN NOW Young and frivolous as I was at that time, the sudden sweeping change (not in mere details only) that is invariably called forth in all hearts by the coming of death&mdash;expected or unexpected, it makes no difference!&mdash;its majesty, its gravity, and its truthfulness could not fail to impress me. END
BEGIN NOW I was impressed too,\. END
BEGIN NOW but for all that, my troubled, childish eyes noted many things at once; they noted how Sletkin, hurriedly and furtively, as though it were something stolen, popped the gun out of sight; how he and his wife became, both of them, instantly the object of a sort of unspoken but universal aloofness. END
BEGIN NOW To Evlampia, though her fault was probably no less than her sister's, this aloofness did not extend. END
BEGIN NOW She even aroused a certain sympathy, when she fell at her dead father's feet. END
BEGIN NOW But that she too was guilty, that was none the less felt by all. END
BEGIN NOW The old man was wronged, said a grey-haired peasant with a big head, leaning, like some ancient judge, with both hands and his beard on a long staff; on your soul lies the sin! END
BEGIN NOW You wronged him! END
BEGIN NOW That saying was at once accepted by every one as the final judgment. END
BEGIN NOW The peasants' sense of justice found expression in it, I felt that at once. END
BEGIN NOW I noticed too that, at the first, Sletkin did not dare to give directions. END
BEGIN NOW Without him, they lifted up the body and carried it into the other house. END
BEGIN NOW Without asking him, the priest went for everything needful to the church, while the village elder ran to the village to send off a cart and horse to the town. END
BEGIN NOW Even Anna Martinovna did not venture to use her ordinary imperious tone in ordering the samovar to be brought, for hot water, to wash the deceased. END
BEGIN NOW Her orders were more like an entreaty, and she was answered rudely.\. END
BEGIN NOW I was absorbed all the while by the question, What was it exactly he wanted to say to his daughter? END
BEGIN NOW Did he want to forgive her or to curse her? END
BEGIN NOW Finally I decided that it was&mdash;forgiveness. END
BEGIN NOW Three days later, the funeral of Martin Petrovitch took place. END
BEGIN NOW The cost of the ceremony was undertaken by my mother, who was deeply grieved at his death, and gave orders that no expense was to he spared. END
BEGIN NOW She did not herself go to the church, because she was unwilling, as she said, to set eyes on those two vile hussies and that nasty little Jew. END
BEGIN NOW But she sent Kvitsinsky, me, and Zhitkov, though from that time forward she always spoke of the latter as a regular old woman. END
BEGIN NOW Souvenir she did not admit to her presence, and was furious with him for long after, saying that he was the murderer of her friend. END
BEGIN NOW He felt his disgrace acutely; he was continually running, on tiptoe, up and down the room, next to the one where my mother was; he gave himself up to a sort of scared and abject melancholy, shuddering and muttering, d'rectly! END
BEGIN NOW In church, and during the procession, Sletkin struck me as having recovered his self-possession. END
BEGIN NOW He gave directions and bustled about in his old way, and kept a greedy look-out that not a superfluous farthing should be spent, though his own pocket was not in question. END
BEGIN NOW Maximka, in a new Cossack dress, also a present from my mother, gave vent to such tenor notes in the choir, that certainly no one could have any doubts as to the sincerity of his devotion to the deceased. END
BEGIN NOW Both the sisters were duly attired in mourning, but they seemed more stupefied than grieved, especially Evlampia. END
BEGIN NOW Anna wore a meek, Lenten air, but made no attempt to weep, and was continually passing her handsome, thin hand over her hair and cheek. END
BEGIN NOW Evlampia seemed deep in thought all the time. END
BEGIN NOW The universal, unbending alienation, condemnation, which I had noticed on the day of Harlov's death, I detected now too on the faces of all the people in the church, in their actions and their glances, but still more grave and, as it were, impersonal. END
BEGIN NOW It seemed as though all those people felt that the sin into which the Harlov family had fallen&mdash;this great sin&mdash;had gone now before the presence of the one righteous Judge, and that for that reason, there was no need now for them to trouble themselves and be indignant. END
BEGIN NOW They prayed devoutly for the soul of the dead man, whom in life they had not specially liked, whom they had feared indeed. END
BEGIN NOW Very abruptly had death overtaken him. END
BEGIN NOW And it's not as though he had been drinking heavily, brother, said one peasant to another, in the porch. END
BEGIN NOW Nay, without drink he was drunken indeed, responded the other. END
BEGIN NOW He was cruelly wronged, the first peasant repeated the phrase that summed it up. END
BEGIN NOW Cruelly wronged, the others murmured after him. END
BEGIN NOW The deceased was a hard master to you, wasn't he? END
BEGIN NOW I asked a peasant, whom I recognised as one of Harlov's serfs. END
BEGIN NOW He was a master, certainly, answered the peasant, but still\. END
BEGIN NOW he was cruelly wronged! END
BEGIN NOW Cruelly wronged,\. END
BEGIN NOW I heard again in the crowd. END
BEGIN NOW At the grave, too, Evlampia stood, as it were, lost. END
BEGIN NOW Thoughts were torturing her\. END
BEGIN NOW bitter thoughts. END
BEGIN NOW I noticed that Sletkin, who several times addressed some remark to her, she treated as she had once treated Zhitkov, and worse still. END
BEGIN NOW Some days later, there was a rumour all over our neighbourhood, that Evlampia Martinovna had left the home of her fathers for ever, leaving all the property that came to her to her sister and brother-in-law, and only taking some hundreds of roubles.\. END
BEGIN NOW So Anna's bought her out, it seems! END
BEGIN NOW remarked my mother; but you and I, certainly, she added, addressing Zhitkov, with whom she was playing picquet&mdash;he took Souvenir's place, are not skilful hands! END
BEGIN NOW Zhitkov looked dejectedly at his mighty palms.\. END
BEGIN NOW Hands like that! END
BEGIN NOW Not skilful! END
BEGIN NOW he seemed to be saying to himself.\. END
BEGIN NOW Soon after, my mother and I went to live in Moscow, and many years passed before it was my lot to behold Martin Petrovitch's daughters again. END
BEGIN NOW BUT I did see them again. END
BEGIN NOW Anna Martinovna I came across in the most ordinary way. END
BEGIN NOW After my mother's death I paid a visit to our village, where I had not been for over fifteen years, and there I received an invitation from the mediator (at that time the process of settling the boundaries between the peasants and their former owners was taking place over the whole of Russia with a slowness not yet forgotten) to a meeting of the other landowners of our neighbourhood, to be held on the estate of the widow Anna Sletkin. END
BEGIN NOW The news that my mother's nasty little Jew, with the prune-coloured eyes, no longer existed in this world, caused me, I confess, no regret whatever. END
BEGIN NOW But it was interesting to get a glimpse of his widow. END
BEGIN NOW She had the reputation in the neighbourhood of a first-rate manager. END
BEGIN NOW And so it proved; her estate and homestead and the house itself (I could not help glancing at the roof; it was an iron one) all turned out to be in excellent order; everything was neat, clean, tidied-up, where needful&mdash;painted, as though its mistress were a German. END
BEGIN NOW Anna Martinovna herself, of course, looked older. END
BEGIN NOW But the peculiar, cold, and, as it were, wicked charm which had once so fascinated me had not altogether left her. END
BEGIN NOW She was dressed in rustic fashion, but elegantly. END
BEGIN NOW She received us, not cordially&mdash;that word was not applicable to her&mdash;but courteously, and on seeing me, a witness of that fearful scene, not an eyelash quivered. END
BEGIN NOW She made not the slightest reference to my mother, nor her father, nor her sister, nor her husband. END
BEGIN NOW She had two daughters, both very pretty, slim young things, with charming little faces, and a bright and friendly expression in their black eyes. END
BEGIN NOW There was a son, too, a little like his father, but still a boy to he proud of! END
BEGIN NOW During the discussions between the landowners, Anna Martinovna's attitude was composed and dignified, she showed no sign of being specially obstinate, nor specially grasping. END
BEGIN NOW But none had a truer perception of their own interests than she of hers; none could more convincingly expound and defend their rights. END
BEGIN NOW All the laws pertinent to the case, even the Minister's circulars, she had thoroughly mastered. END
BEGIN NOW She spoke little, and in a quiet voice, but every word she uttered was to the point. END
BEGIN NOW It ended in our all signifying our agreement to all her demands, and making concessions, which we could only marvel at ourselves. END
BEGIN NOW On our way home, some of the worthy landowners even used harsh words of themselves; they all hummed and hawed, and shook their heads. END
BEGIN NOW Ah, she's got brains that woman! END
BEGIN NOW said one. END
BEGIN NOW A tricky baggage! END
BEGIN NOW put in another less delicate proprietor. END
BEGIN NOW Smooth in word, but cruel in deed! END
BEGIN NOW And a screw into the bargain! END
BEGIN NOW added a third; not a glass of vodka nor a morsel of caviare for us&mdash;what do you think of that? END
BEGIN NOW What can one expect of her? END
BEGIN NOW suddenly croaked a gentleman who had been silent till then, every one knows she poisoned her husband! END
BEGIN NOW To my astonishment, nobody thought fit to controvert this awful and certainly unfounded charge! END
BEGIN NOW I was the more surprised at this, as, in spite of the slighting expressions I have reported, all of them felt respect for Anna Martinovna, not excluding the indelicate landowner. END
BEGIN NOW As for the mediator, he waxed positively eloquent. END
BEGIN NOW Put her on a throne, he exclaimed, she'd be another Semiramis or Catherine the Second! END
BEGIN NOW The discipline among her peasants is a perfect model.\. END
BEGIN NOW The education of her children is model! END
BEGIN NOW What a head! END
BEGIN NOW What brains! END
BEGIN NOW Without going into the question of Semiramis and Catherine, there was no doubt Anna Martinovna was living a very happy life. END
BEGIN NOW Ease, inward and external, the pleasant serenity of spiritual health, seemed the very atmosphere about herself, her family, all her surroundings. END
BEGIN NOW How far she had deserved such happiness.\. END
BEGIN NOW that is another question. END
BEGIN NOW Such questions, though, are only propounded in youth. END
BEGIN NOW Everything in the world, good and bad, comes to man, not through his deserts, but in consequence of some as yet unknown but logical laws which I will not take upon myself to indicate, though I sometimes fancy I have a dim perception of them. END
BEGIN NOW I QUESTIONED the mediator about Evlampia Martinovna, and learnt that she had been lost sight of completely ever since she left home, and probably had departed this life long ago. END
BEGIN NOW So our worthy mediator expressed himself but I am convinced that I have seen Evlampia, that I have come across her. END
BEGIN NOW This was how it was. END
BEGIN NOW Four years after my interview with Anna Martinovna, I was spending the summer at Murino, a little hamlet near Petersburg, a well-known resort of summer visitors of the middle class. END
BEGIN NOW The shooting was pretty decent about Murino at that time, and I used to go out with my gun almost every day. END
BEGIN NOW I had a companion on my expeditions, a man of the tradesman class, called Vikulov, a very sensible and good-natured fellow; but, as he said of himself, of no position whatever. END
BEGIN NOW This man had been simply everywhere, and everything! END
BEGIN NOW Nothing could astonish him, he knew everything&mdash;but he cared for nothing but shooting and wine. END
BEGIN NOW Well, one day we were on our way home to Murino, and we chanced to pass a solitary house, standing at the cross-roads, and enclosed by a high, close paling. END
BEGIN NOW It was not the first time I had seen the house, and every time it excited my curiosity. END
BEGIN NOW There was something about it mysterious, locked-up, grimly-dumb, something suggestive of a prison or a hospital. END
BEGIN NOW Nothing of it could be seen from the road but its steep, dark, red-painted roof. END
BEGIN NOW There was only one pair of gates in the whole fence; and these seemed fastened and never opened. END
BEGIN NOW No sound came from the other side of them. END
BEGIN NOW For all that, we felt that some one was certainly living in the house; it had not at all the air of a deserted dwelling. END
BEGIN NOW On the I contrary, everything about it was stout, and tight, and strong, as if it would stand a siege! END
BEGIN NOW What is that fortress? END
BEGIN NOW I asked my companion. END
BEGIN NOW Don't you know? END
BEGIN NOW Vikulov gave a sly wink. END
BEGIN NOW A fine building, eh? END
BEGIN NOW The police-captain of these parts gets a nice little income out of it! END
BEGIN NOW How's that? END
BEGIN NOW I'll tell you. END
BEGIN NOW You've heard, I daresay, of the Flagellant dissenters&mdash;that do without priests, you know? END
BEGIN NOW Yes. END
BEGIN NOW Well, it's there that their chief mother lives. END
BEGIN NOW A woman? END
BEGIN NOW Yes&mdash;the mother; a mother of God, they say. END
BEGIN NOW Nonsense! END
BEGIN NOW I tell you, it is so. END
BEGIN NOW She is a strict one, they say.\. END
BEGIN NOW A regular commander-in-chief! END
BEGIN NOW She rules over thousands! END
BEGIN NOW I'd take her, and all these mothers of God\. END
BEGIN NOW But what's the use of talking? END
BEGIN NOW He called his Pegashka, a marvellous dog, with an excellent scent, but with no notion of setting. END
BEGIN NOW Vikulov was obliged to tie her hind paws to keep her from running so furiously. END
BEGIN NOW His words sank into my memory. END
BEGIN NOW I sometimes went out of my way to pass by the mysterious house. END
BEGIN NOW One day I had just got up to it, when suddenly&mdash;wonderful to relate!&mdash;a bolt grated in the gates, a key creaked in the lock, then the gates themselves slowly parted, there appeared a large horse's head, with a plaited forelock under a decorated yoke, and slowly there rolled into the road a small cart, like those driven by horse-dealers, and higglers. END
BEGIN NOW On the leather cushion of the cart, near to me, sat a peasant of about thirty, of a remarkably handsome and attractive appearance, in a neat black smock, and a black cap, pulled down low on his forehead. END
BEGIN NOW He was carefully driving the well-fed horse, whose sides were as broad as a stove. END
BEGIN NOW Beside the peasant, on the far side of the cart, sat a tall woman, as straight as an arrow. END
BEGIN NOW Her head was covered by a costly-looking black shawl. END
BEGIN NOW She was dressed in a short jerkin of dove-coloured velvet, and a dark blue merino skirt; her white hands she held discreetly clasped on her bosom. END
BEGIN NOW The cart turned on the road to the left, and brought the woman within two paces of me; she turned her head a little, and I recognised Evlampia Harlov. END
BEGIN NOW I knew her at once, I did not doubt for one instant, and indeed no doubt was possible; eyes like hers, and above all that cut of the lips&mdash;haughty and sensual&mdash;I had never seen in any one else. END
BEGIN NOW Her face had grown longer and thinner, the skin was darker, here and there lines could be discerned; but, above all, the expression of the face was changed! END
BEGIN NOW It is difficult to do justice in words to the self-confidence, the sternness, the pride it had gained! END
BEGIN NOW Not simply the serenity of power&mdash;the satiety of power was visible in every feature. END
BEGIN NOW The careless glance she cast at me told of long years of habitually meeting nothing but reverent, unquestioning obedience. END
BEGIN NOW That woman clearly lived surrounded, not by worshippers, but by slaves. END
BEGIN NOW She had clearly forgotten even the time when any command, any desire of hers, was not carried out at the instant! END
BEGIN NOW I called her loudly by her name and her father's; she gave a faint start, looked at me a second time, not with alarm, but with contemptuous wrath, as though asking&mdash; Who dares to disturb me? END
BEGIN NOW and barely parting her lips, uttered a word of command. END
BEGIN NOW The peasant sitting beside her started forward, with a wave of his arm struck the horse with the reins&mdash;the horse set off at a strong rapid trot, and the cart disappeared. END
BEGIN NOW Since then I have not seen Evlampia again. END
BEGIN NOW In what way Martin Petrovitch's daughter came to be a Holy Virgin in the Flagellant sect I cannot imagine. END
BEGIN NOW But, who knows, very likely she has founded a sect which will be called&mdash;or even now is called&mdash;after her name, the Evlampieshtchin sect? END
BEGIN NOW Anything may be, anything may come to pass. END
BEGIN NOW And so this is what I had to tell you of my Lear of the Steppes, of his family and his doings. END
BEGIN NOW The story-teller ceased, and we talked a little longer, and then parted, each to his home.  END
BEGIN NOW I am he as you are he as you are me And we are all together See how they run like pigs from a gun see how they fly I'm crying Sitting on a cornflake waiting for the van to come Corporation tee shirt, stupid bloody Tuesday Man you been a naughty boy. END
BEGIN NOW You let your face grow long I am the eggman, they are the eggmen I am the walrus, goo goo g' joob Mister City Policeman sitting, pretty little policemen in a row See how they fly like Lucy in the sky, see how they run I'm crying, I'm crying I'm crying, I'm crying Yellow matter custard dripping from a dead dog's eye Crabalocker fishwife pornographic priestess Boy you been a naughty girl, you let your knickers down I am the eggman, they are the eggmen I am the walrus, goo goo g' joob Sitting in an English garden waiting for the sun If the sun don't come You get a tan from standing in the English rain I am the eggman, they are the eggmen I am the walrus, goo goo g' joob goo goo goo g' joob Expert texpert choking smokers Don't you think the joker laughs at you?

BEGIN NOW Ha ha ha!) END
